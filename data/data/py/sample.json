[
    "Here with me now is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Thank you so much for joining me. Let's start with that potential deal, sir. 100 hostages about are still being held by Hamas. You're sending that negotiating team to Qatar in the coming days to talk about a potential deal. Free hostages in exchange for a six week pause in fighting. As you know, Hamas is demanding the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for roughly 40 female hostages. Are you open to that? Are you close to a deal? Well, time will tell. But Hamas's outlandish demands and I'm not itemizing every one of them now makes that deal a lot more difficult. But I'm we're going to keep on trying because we want those hostages back. We understand also that the one thing that gets Hamas to give them is to give these hostages to us is the continued military pressure that we're applying there. And so we're going to continue military pressure and we're going to continue to try to get those hostages out. And we've succeeded already in bringing half of them out. I hope we continue along that same course. Let's talk about what happened here in the U.S. this week. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer gave a pivotal speech and said you have lost your way and called you an obstacle to peace. Take a listen. The Netanyahu coalition no longer fits the needs of Israel after October 7th. And I believe that holding a new election once the war starts to wind down would give Israelis an opportunity to express their vision for the postwar future. Chuck Schumer is the highest ranking Jewish elected official here in America, a staunch supporter of Israel. What's your response? I think what he said is totally inappropriate. It's inappropriate for a to go to a sister democracy and try to replace the elected leadership there. That's something that Israel, the Israeli public, does on its own. We're not a banana republic. I think the only government that we should be working on to bring down now is the terrorist tyranny in Gaza, the Hamas tyranny that murdered over a thousand Israelis, including some dozens of Americans, and is holding Americans and Israelis hostage. That's what we should be focused on. And as far as what Senator Schumer said, the majority of Israelis support our governments. 82% of Americans support Israel instead of Hamas. But the majority of Israelis support the policies that we're leading. Go into Rafah, destroy the remaining Hamas terrorist battalions, make sure that we don't put into Gaza instead of Hamas, the Palestinian Authority that educates their children towards terrorism and the annihilation of Israel. And and also an enormous majority here, including 99 Knesset members to nine, oppose the idea of ramming down a Palestinian state down our throats. I want. To get to, you know, the. Majority of Israelis. Senator Schumer, the majority of Israelis support the policies of my government. It's not a fringe government. It represents the policies supported by the majority of the people. If Senator Schumer opposes these policies, is not opposing me. Is opposing the people of Israel. Okay. I'm going to get to some of the polls that you cited in one moment, but I just want to make sure that our viewers understand that Chuck Schumer gave the big speech, but he has support in many ways from the president of the United States. President Biden is a self-described Zionist. Even he is starting to distance distance himself from the way you are handling the war. He called what Schumer said a good speech. He said that he shared the concern of many Americans. They aren't criticizing Israel. They're criticizing you and your right wing coalition. Dana, there is a fallacy that is being perpetrated here. And you should take polls. You'll have your own polls and check whether the people of Israel support the policies that I'm being criticized for that is supporting the policies of going into Rafah, destroying a quarter of the remaining Hamas terrorist army. That's like leaving a quarter of the hammer of the Nazi terrorist army in Germany and saying, now we're not going to finish the last quarter and we're not going into Berlin. Most Israelis overwhelmingly support the position that we have to go in. They oppose the idea of ramming down a two state solution or a terrorist state against their will because they think that this will endanger Israel's future. They support those policies that I'm putting forward and to present that as something that is an outlier doesn't represent a majority of the people of Israel. It's simply a fallacy. And I'll tell you, the other part of the fallacy is they're saying, well, most Palestinians don't support the Hamas massacre. In fact, 85% of the Palestinians do support, unfortunately, the Hamas massacre. So they've got to fallacies here. And you can readily check that the majority of Israelis support the policies that I have on prosecuting the war, which is what I'm being criticized for. Well, it's not just me. I think people. Of Israel who believe that we have to have this resolution. I think that I think that we should be criticized, have the policy is not. Align themselves. More. It's the way that you're prosecuting the war. So I'm going to get to that in one minute. But I just want to add a little bit of sort of context to the way that the Biden administration is pushing back. Another way is that the U.S. intelligence community warned that, quote, distrust of Netanyahu's ability to rule has deepened and broadened across the public and then back to the polls. You're talking about support for the idea of toppling Hamas. That makes perfect sense. There were other polls in Israel, three major Israeli television stations, that said what Israelis also support are early elections. That's what I really want to focus on. Here is Senator Schumer not calling to sort of topple the government, but specifically says when the war winds down, will you commit to calling New elections? That's my question. Will you. Donna? Two thirds first of all, what you said is wrong. The vast majority of Israelis oppose early elections until the war doesn't end. We've just had many polls on that. Look, a lot of the polls are, you know. Channel 12 says Channel 12 says 64% of Israelis. But all polls. Show that's not. Now, I'm afraid that they ask them the question, do you support it during the war? And they said. That's not what Schumer's number where he's calling for new elections. When the. Winds down. Well, we'll see when we win the war. And until we win the war, I think Israelis understand that if we were to have elections now before the war is won, resoundingly won, we would have at least six months of national paralysis, which means we would lose the war. If we don't win the war, we lose the war. And that would be not only a defeat for Israel, but a defeat for America, too, because our victory is your victory. We're fighting this. But when you commit to new elections, when the war winds. Down, everything that everything that we hold dear together. Will you commit to new elections? I think that's something for the Israeli public to decide. But it's not it's not something that's look, that's something for the Israeli people to decide. I think it's ridiculous to talk about it. It's like after 911, you know, after 911, you're in the midst of fighting the war against al Qaeda. And an Israeli would say, you know, what we need now is either new elections in the U.S. or if your system doesn't allow, then President Bush should resign and we should have an alternative leader. You don't do that. Well, let's do about why a. Sister, a democracy to an ally. You don't talk about that. What you do talk about is how do we help you defeat what President Biden called sheer evil? You don't just stop after you destroyed 80% of sheer evil. You destroy 70. Percent of sheer evil.",
    "After severe storms and tornadoes hit multiple communities, killing at least three people. One local official says it looks looks like a bomb went off. And now a massive cleanup and recovery operation is underway. CNN's Ivan Rodriguez is there in the hard hit community of Lakeview, Ohio. Ivan, tell us more about what you're seeing. Well, Fredricka, after that powerful F3 tornado came through Lakeview here in Logan County, Ohio, as you mentioned, a lot of cleanup efforts are now underway in the background and we can hear chainsaws. Crews have really been at it all day long trying to clean up some of the debris that you can see behind me. Now, this is just a glimpse, Fredricka, of all the damage that we're seeing across Lakeview. And you can really see just debris scattered everywhere. Feet away from me is a roof that belonged to the home right behind me, a car here. This Honda CRV has been smashed in with its windows blown out. And this this object here, you can't really make out what it is very well. But the person who lives in this home told us that it's actually a dog house that flew out from a next door neighbor that's now on their property. So that cleanup process is ongoing. But moments ago, we were able to step into the home here of Mary and Joe Baker. They told me that they were in their living room when they heard the tornado sirens go off. As soon as the sirens started going off and started heading toward your bedroom. Yes. This is the living room. This is the dining room. At that point, they continue walking through the living room. She leads me into their main bedroom and she shows me exactly in the home where they hid. They both she says she, her and her husband went into the closet of the home. They got their animals, their pets, and just shelter in place. She said They were there for about 15 minutes, but it felt like an eternity. I asked her as well, Fredricka, you know, do you remember the last conversation that you had when you got into that closet? And she told me she just grabbed her husband's hand, she prayed and she asked the Lord, she said to just keep them safe, keep them sheltered, as well as the other people here in Lakeview as well. And if you could see inside from where we're standing, this is the room that we're talking about here. You can see a beam of wood smashed through the side of the wall. This roof's completely caved in. So really, their home has been severely damaged, but they're very grateful to still have each other. And also the fact that the community has really been coming together through all of this pain, all of this destruction, it's going to be a long road to rebuilding. We heard the governor of Ohio mention how the community is going to bounce back. A lot of that he mentioned has to do with the strength of the community here. I also spoke with a contractor who's working for free to make sure that a lot of these roofs are waterproof. So it's just one example of how the community is really coming together after such a painful experience. Right. Lots of concerns, but a real close call for that family and they're counting their blessings. Ivan Rodriguez, thank you so much. All right. A man and his children were trapped in a Wal-Mart during this devastating tornado that hit Indiana. Jacob Hudson says people continue to shop until a Walmart employee rushed everyone towards the produce section. He hid with his family in a restroom until the tornado passed. And Jacob Hudson is here to tell us all about it. My goodness, Jacob, I mean, what a moment. You go shopping and then the next thing you know, you all are taking shelter. So did you know the storm was coming? What happened while you were in that Walmart? Yeah, well, we had no idea the storm is going to be anything like that. Actually, we live about 10 minutes away, and when we left our home, it was actually sunny and nice, our kids playing outside and everything. And we got there. We got to Walmart maybe around 730 a time. We got to, you know, Winchester, the sky definitely turned and it was you could see storms coming in, but we were just shopping like normal and suddenly everybody's phones in the store went off and that was the tornado warning. And we were almost done. So we were actually going to you just try to get home. And then our employee said, Hey, you guys, can you go to the produce area? You know, a storm is coming in to take shelter for now. So some people say in the Kurdish area, some stayed in a office and he put us in a family restroom and we were in there maybe ten, 15 minutes and nothing, nothing was happening. We opened the door, tried to get some air and just hear what was going on. And then suddenly a worker Roshi said, it's hurting right now and came in and dove in there with us. We hurry up and shut the door and within seconds you could just hear wind going crazy and things banging around outside and, you know. So what are the ages of your kids? And while you're in this space, you know, and taking cover, are you holding your kids or are you hovering around them? Describe for me what you instinctively did. Yes, that's basically what we did. We hunkered in the corner of the restroom and even at work or we wrapped our arms just all together. And I was on the floor with my daughter who was at home. And I was you know, I was worried about her, too. And we just said a Hail Mary. And my kids were screaming, crying. You know, we're just hunched down and no idea what's going on around us. Oh, my goodness. Maybe 30 seconds. And then everything just got very quiet and we opened the door and there was that's where you just see debris in front of us, like, oh, my God. So when it got really quiet, what were you and all the other shoppers, employees that were in that space thinking, did you whisper anything to one another? Was it a matter of, you know, is it over? Or do we do we go out? Just take me to that moment. Yeah, that's we actually the the five of us in that restroom, you know, we we waited just to make sure everything was fine. We waited for quite a moment, and, you know, it was more just, okay, it's over. Let's wait till the kids see. We're fine. It's okay. It's fine. We made it. It's okay. They're crying. Yes, they were crying. Screaming. I mean, it's it's something you don't want to see as a father. They wish you could see. Just see the fear in their eyes. And, you know, as a father, you don't want that. And there's nothing you can do to change that. It was a very, very scary moment. And then your impressions once the door opened or once you all emerged from the safe space where you were, I was just kind of shock. Like at first I just seen like trash and debris in front of us. And then I kind of looked around the corner and I seen the doors of the Walmart actually pushed in and some workers quickly moved that door. And after everything seemed to be calm outside, I took a look outside and there it was, just sheet metal, plywood, damaged cars and far into the parking lot, shared. A car was kind of turned over. I mean, it was it was chaos. I mean, and this was littered everywhere. And your daughter at home, how how did she fare and everything? She was completely fine, like I said, Really 10 minutes away. Luckily, nothing happened. Here. She was she was in the bathroom. Ah, a bathtub with a blanket over her. I was trying to comfort her. I was literally more worried about her. Yeah. You know, warning first went off because, like I said, this took time until it hit. And, you know, I'm worried about her, and then it ends up hitting us at the store. Oh, my goodness. Well, she did all the right things, as did you and all the employees and other shoppers who were with you at that Walmart. We're so glad you're able to tell the story of your survival story. Jacob Hudson, thank you so much. Thank you.",
    "As you know, it's been a tough week for the prosecutors trying to put former President Trump on trial, particularly in Georgia, where the lead prosecutor is now no longer on the case. Nathan Way tenders tendered his resignation after a scathing ruling from a judge forced his boss, Fani Willis, to choose between removing her entire office from their election interference case or removing Wade. Now joining me now is Ed O'Callahan. He is a former federal prosecutor. He also was a top Justice Department official in the Trump Justice Department. You also helped to oversee the Mueller investigation. So I'm really interested to get your take on what happened yesterday with the judge in Georgia. So it was a very interesting decision by the judge in Georgia yesterday. He essentially chose to give Fani Willis the option of whether she herself would be removed from the case or the prosecutor that she had appointed in particular to run the the case against Donald Trump and the coconspirators. Mr. Wade essentially resigned, which I think was the right thing for him to do. And so far, he will remain as the D.A. on the case. She now has to find a top prosecutor to to replace Mr. Wade. It is no small matter when when a judge removes a prosecutor from a case. But I think this judge has been doing a pretty remarkable job in the face of what anyone would assess to be kind of a circus in the courtroom. Well, before any trial is to take place. And he's he's dealing with the issues as they come before them, before him, and making rulings that he thinks are in the best judgment to keep the case moving forward. Yeah, young judge, been on the bench just about a year and then has to handle this question of whether her entire office should be disqualified because finally Willis and Nathan Wade had a romantic relationship. The defendants were claiming that she financially benefited. The judge said that they did not actually prove that allegation. But you've been involved in a high profile investigation related to former President Trump. You have to be I mean, basically the pope, right? You have to be beyond reproach. What is your reaction to what transpired here? Yeah, I mean, I think the judge appropriately laid forward some of his concerns, to say the least, about what the evidence in the hearings displayed, which which, you know, were some ethical issues for sure. And, you know, look, as a prosecutor that has the responsibility to represent the people in in bringing a case. You do want to be above reproach. Obviously, we're dealing with human beings. But but the fact of the matter is, you're held to a higher standard. And that standard is when you represent the people of the state of Georgia or in federal court, the people of the United States, that there should not be any any any doubt about the existence of any conflict of interest, even the appearance of a conflict of interest. And what I think we saw was there was plenty of conflict of interest here. And I think the judge did his best, given the difficult facts that were presented before him. I want to turn our attention to Manhattan. The Manhattan district attorney's case against former President Trump was expected to be the first criminal trial. Right. It was scheduled to begin in a week. But in the past few days, they suddenly received tens of thousands of pages of evidence from your old office, the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutors in Manhattan. So now the judge is holding a hearing a week from now to figure out if he needs a new trial date. How does something like this happen where suddenly tens of thousands of pages of evidence are turned over from federal prosecutors to the state prosecutor? Yeah, I have to tell you, Paul, it's incredibly unusual in my experience that given where obviously we know the Southern District of New York had some cases, most prominently the Michael Cohen case and presumably some of these documents are coming from their cache of documents that were developed in their investigation of that case. But that case has been long over. Michael Cohen has already served this jail sentence and he's back out. And so I find it difficult to understand what it was that prevented Southern District from giving the Manhattan days office whatever they were asking for that was relevant either in cometary information or exculpatory, frankly, or even more importantly for the defense. You know, in my experience and as a Southern district of New York prosecutor, there was a strong rivalry with the Manhattan DA's office. Frankly, the only time that, you know, you would keep information from another prosecutor's office that that is representing to you, that they can use it either in a case that's already charged or a further investigate is when I thought I still had investigative avenues to pursue. And I thought that there was something in that cache of documents that I wanted to make sure I ran to ground. Now, I'm not saying that I'm aware of anything like that happening in the Southern District of New York. That's really the only justifiable reason I could I could imagine that they didn't immediately turn it over at the request of D.A. Brack. So look down to Florida, the classified documents case. It's been two weeks now. I've been waiting for the judge to set a new trial date in that case. There are some questions about whether that case will go before November. What is your assessment of that case and whether it can realistically go before the election? And is that a product of the judge or is it just the nature of the case? Yeah, I think that it's going to be difficult in my assessment to for that case to go before the November I go to trial before the November election. There are a number of circumstances that have a lot of bearing on that. One is just the nature of the charges. You know, the judge did rule against Mr. Trump and his effort to dismiss the Espionage Act charges on unconstitutionally vague arguments she did say was without prejudice, which actually can prove a little troublesome for the prosecutor, that they still might have to deal with that down the road. But but she's at least move that along. But in terms of what's what's really the difficult part of that case is all of the classified information that's involved in it. There are procedures in cases involving classified documents. It's Classified Information Procedures Act, which there have been some hearings in that. But but the fact of the matter is, because those hearings take longer. This judge is unfortunately, a little bit unfamiliar with those proceedings. I just think it's going to take longer to hash all that through. And that basically is an asset. The judge has to make rulings when the prosecutor says, yeah, discovery for the defendant to defend themselves against certain allegations that they don't necessarily need access to all the classified material that might be implicated in the case. And she's got to make some pretty strong rulings saying that the defense does not need that. And that's a difficult thing for judges to do there. They are inclined to frankly, provide as much discovery as a defendant wants. But in classified document cases, it's a different beast and she just doesn't have familiarity with it. So I think it's just going to take longer. Another arguably inexperienced judge. All right. So we talked about three of the four criminal cases against former President Trump. The calendar is crowded. It's confusing, it's uncertain. Do you think any of these cases are going to go before the election? Yeah, I do think I do think the Manhattan D.A. case will go before the election. I think that the judge, Judge Marcia, on their has has shown that he wants to push this case forward. I think that they will figure out this discovery. There may be some, quote unquote, bombshells that come out in the discovery, which lead to more motion practice. But that seems like it is teed up to go before trial. And the other case, of course, we haven't talked about is the January six case that is pending before the Supreme Court on the issue of whether the president should have absolute immunity from prosecution. If you look at the timing of that case, it is pretty interesting. They've set the oral argument at the Supreme Court for April 25th. That means it's likely that a decision on that comes out with with the rest of the end of term opinions, which is end of June, arguably, you know, because there's only one defendant that's only, you know, Mr. Trump in that case. There's an argument that that case could be set before Judge Chuck King here, who's also indicated that she wants this to go to trial, you know, sometime late September, early October. It's possible you then bump up against the DOJ policy, of course, of whether or not you actually bring the case doesn't apply here in a criminal trial. They broke that news two weeks ago. I think that there is a frankly, a more typically nuanced common sense application of that of that policy than than what we strictly represented there. I do think that at the end of the day, everything would turn out that they don't push to do that trial before the election as well. But I could see the schedule working out that that that trial does go before the election. Fascinating. We'll have you back to talk about all of it. It's going to be a busy year. Lots of trials, maybe. We'll see. Adam time, thank you so much. Thank you, Paula.",
    "Are looking at images seen earlier in Trenton, New Jersey, which is the focal point right now, where it's believed this suspect may be. And again, in this imagery we saw earlier. You see law enforcement on that second level. You can see to the right of that residence there is a ladder we watched off camera, not live on television, but we saw it off camera. We saw the investigator or the authority walking up to that second level. And you see right here opening, getting into the window and then escorting somebody out. We've since learned, Danny, through your reporting that all the residences, how they're classifying the people in that house, they have all been taken out safely. All right. With this now, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. All right. So. So and this is across state lines, which is why we also love your expertise, because now, you know, this possibly is a federal investigation ripe for crossing state lines. So if indeed this suspect continues to be in there. Talk to us about the priority of events, trying to negotiate with this person or perhaps the priority is really trying to get residents out safely. Now, what possibly is transpiring. So, Fred, you hit the nail on the head there. The first thing, if you have the opportunity to do it and it looks from this compelling video that they had the chance to and took advantage of it, you want to get as many potential hostages, residents or actual hostages out on out of that building and off the scene to safety as you possibly can. And what you're seeing there is a very careful, incredibly dangerous, risky move, but one that successfully evacuated number those hostages. Every time you have a hostage leave the set, the level of risk and danger reduces somewhat. And that is really the thing that law enforcement is focused on going forward as they're you know, everybody thinks about hostage situations in terms of a tactical entry where a tactical team or a SWAT team goes in and confronts the offender or the hostage taker. In reality, that is the that's the option of last resort. It's incredibly dangerous for the law enforcement folks involved and for anybody who's in the house. And so unless people are in imminent danger of serious injury or death, you're going to put that tactical entry off as long as you possibly can. And if you can put it off by engaging with the hostage taker, talking to them, negotiating with them, striking deals for things like food or communications or access to talk to other people, You're going to do that as long as you possibly can. So these things can typically really drag out. If it starts to drag out like that, that's a sign that they do not believe that anyone inside is in imminent danger of of of death or injury. And what about from a public safety standpoint? Because you're talking Trenton, New Jersey, which is, you know, very heavily, densely populated. We're looking at what appears to be a duplex. And while we are hearing the reporting that residents have been safely escorted from that building, you also look at the proximity of that duplex to the next one over and what's likely across the street, etc.. So what is likely happening involving their law enforcement resources about keeping people where they are communicating with other residents in the area evacuating? I mean, what is transpiring possibly? Well, first, you know, the responding law enforcement officers are going to be dealing with city officials to understand based on plans, based on surveys, based on building permits that may have been filed. They want to understand exactly what that target residence involves. How big is it, how many rooms, what's the layout? They also want to know if it's been combined with any of the structures that are adjacent to it, because that would give your subject the ability to move surreptitiously to a different location. So they're going to be doing that in the background upfront as they determine it's safe to do so. They're going to probably interact with each one of those adjacent residents, each one of those structures on that block. And if they can, they want to get those people out of there, evacuate them, take them to a place of safety where they can be cared for and catered to until this is all over. That's not always as easy as it sounds. Sometimes you have you know, you have homes with people who have medical conditions or mobility issues and they can't be evacuated quickly and easily. And so you want to communicate with those folks, maybe give them a law enforcement presence in there in their location to make sure that they are safe, where they have to kind of post up and stay inside. So all of these logistics issues are being addressed in the background while we watch what's going on in front of the House and, of course, on that roof there where folks are doing their work. And Andy, are there federal resources that are being devoted to this right now in addition to the municipalities? No question. And I think you heard at the Pennsylvania press conference that they're they've already interacted with their federal partners at the ATF and also at the FBI. I would expect that the New Jersey officials have done the same thing. As you mentioned, there is an interstate element to this crime started in Pennsylvania, now seems to be centered in Jersey. That's certainly a source of jurisdiction, although I would say carjacking is generally there's there's a federal offense for carjacking because of the mobility involved with carjacking. So there's there's plenty of federal nexus here to involve the resources from the FBI and other agencies, oftentimes in smaller, more rural spots, your federal partners can bring tools and capabilities to a situation like this that you might the local agencies might not have, like hostage negotiators or or high tech surveillance capabilities that can actually give you eyes and ears inside the hostage location. But here you're talking about some pretty big municipal departments, Mercer County, Trenton, Bucks County, in in in Pennsylvania, very close to Philadelphia. So there's a lot of robust law enforcement resources right in that local area. Okay. I also want to invite to this conversation former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey. Also with us, hostage negotiator Tom Verni. And I wonder, Tom, if I could go to you next, because while we're hearing reportedly residents have been safely escorted out, we don't know if there remain any others or anyone who is being classified as a hostage at this point. So what likely is happening right now to make sure that communication is underway with the suspect, while delicately also trying to figure out how to bring anyone out of harm's way? Good afternoon. And a crazy tragedy to be happening on a Saturday. Yeah. And, you know, this is something that, you know, police departments train for and hope that never happens. And as been mentioned by my colleagues, you know, the the idea here is to try to lower the temperature of the room, so to speak. We clearly have an individual who is well armed, unfortunately, and has snapped. So now you have someone who is going through an emotionally, you know, is emotionally disturbed and and has weaponry to harm. He's already harmed other people, probably has no qualms about harming the police, very likely. And, you know, could certainly harm himself. So the idea is, is to try to, you know, at least calm things down enough where the adrenaline starts to dissipate a little bit as best as possible. How do you calm things down? Especially given what you just laid out, you know, the sequence of events that you know, are are being described as very violent. Led to at least three deaths that police are confirming right now. So how does one maintain calm in what is a very erratic situation? Well, on the police side, you know, they're going to be rational thinking, fairly calm people. I mean, they're going to be certainly they're is going to be running a little bit, too, because they don't want to get injured or worse in this situation, because, you know, we have to, you know, work under the assumption that this person feels as if they have nothing to lose. And and if they want to go out in a blaze of glory, you know, they're going to take everybody else with them. And it so that's how the day started. We're just hoping that that doesn't end that way. So, again, you know, the idea here is to try to reason with someone who is who may be, you know, still somewhat unreasonable and de-escalation tactics or of paramount importance here. And it's not it and it's not easy thing to do. You know, usually after, you know, everyone is kind of in a place where they're stationary and they don't feel like they're sort of, for lack of a better term, under the gun to hide somewhere else or to carjack somebody else and flee or whatever it may be, then things start to naturally calm down a little bit. Now, if there's something that they feel that they can use, that this suspect might want, then that's, you know, you try to find something, some sort of common ground, right. To establish that link to, you know, to try to bring that person to a much more reasonable place. And then, you know, as was mentioned before, to get these other people out of it, which they've already done. So that that that's the good part about this is that no one is in imminent danger at this point except maybe the suspect.

    " With eight months to go. Historically, support for third-party candidates shrinks closer to the election. People realize they're not going to win. I need to vote for a winner, Pero though. Remember, got 19%. So we have to watch this and see is this\ntraditional or is it like 1992? We've got to watch it play so look, just in Arizona, this is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Support among hispanics, Latinos, 19% that mostly hertz Biden, right, because that's traditionally a more democratic constituency, although there has been a little trickle back to Republicans and recycles younger voters. He's getting 16%. Again, your reflexes that hurts Biden, right? The\nDemocrats mostly get younger voters. Independence is as I said, that's a bit of a draw. There are independent Republican leaning independents, democratic union defense, but look at this. Joe Biden needs Democrats in the city's urban areas. Robert Kennedy's get 11%, but rural voters, that's traditionally you're trump based Robert Kennedy's getting 13%. So both campaigns are going to have to study, that's just Arizona. Bring up Pennsylvania to look at it as well in these key states, absolutely critical to getting to 270. Kennedy gets 6% of Biden voters in Pennsylvania. So if you're Biden campaign say that's a problem. Well, he's getting 9% of 2020 trump voters in Pennsylvania in the city's 9% in the suburbs, 7%. But again, a lot of trump voters in those rural Pennsylvania counties. He's getting 10%. So the the key thing is Anderson both campaigns, eight months, they're gonna have to study in which state is he hurting me in which state might he and the others don't forget the others be helping me and guess what, money you think trump would spend his money just against Biden. Biden's just against trump no. Watch pretty soon. There'll be some ads against Bobby Kennedy. You can count on it. >> John king. Thank you. >> We're now in the state of play that John just touched on in Arizona, specifically, what undecided women voters there are saying about the issues that matter to them this time around. It's part of Randy K is continuing election series, the 53%, which is the average proportion of women voters and presidential elections since 2000 Randy's conversation came during a week that saw vice president Kamala Harris make a stop at a planned parenthood clinic in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the first time sitting vice president has visited an abortion provider. The Biden campaign is clearly looking to make reproductive rights an issue during the campaign. And what's top of mind for the women that Randy talked to? >> Forever >> I don't know why the hell women's reproductive rights or even a political converse. Amen converse ai look at the end of thy >> We have >> To do, you know, potential presidents like you have no business up in my body. Exactly. >> It's not only reproductive rights, their now it's talking about ivf. What is next? I do not want anyone a government official who is a non-doctors, not part of my medical team telling me what and I can and cannot do to my body or what is right for my body, how important our reproductive rights and freedoms to you in terms of choosing a candidate that's my top issue for all of you >> I think it's definitely on the top one or two. And the timelines coming up where me and my husband wanted to start trying and I'm scared for when I start trying and something happens and if I have to make that choice? Left either to die or doctors will go to jail. >> These six women are all independent voters living in the critical swing state of Arizona. And they are all undecided until we brought them together in Scottsdale. They'd never met though all or affiliated with the women's business it's organization. No women can't believe I'm saying it here. >> Like >> Friends and family don't even know this, but I had to have a medical abortion and they were like, it is either your life like or it's this unborn baby. And to rip that a way is not okay. Like we are literally going back so far in history, we have come such a long way we have font such a hard battle and so many people have died along the way. In the fact that we are going to go back to that such a joke isn't it? >> Which candidate do you think would do the best job with the board? >> I'm sorry, we pick on Biden's >> We had to round it do I'm he's like none of the above. Is that what you want? Trump has declined to rule out resuming his contentious zero tolerance policy that led to thousands of migrant children and parents to be separated at the us border in 2018. Why is it always >> Separation of families? Why is that the go to >> I am a child of immigrants my entire family are immigrants. My father is a direct immigrant. He crossed over when he was in his 20s, but he did it the correct way. As a Mexican American, I've lived here and I've known both cultures and it's a struggle on it's like, sorry, it's makes me a little bit emotional sometimes because we are a country of immigrants. But also what Biden is doing by letting mass quantities in. There was already a murder. >> So when you hear trump's say something like, you know, he's going to do the biggest number of deportations in us history. How do you feel about that? >> It breaks my heart I worry about the friends and the family. I am of lighter skin tone. Okay. No one's going to ask me for my documents or whatever. What about my father? He's very dark skinned. >> One thing that binds proposing is through executive action is having asylum officers at the border and they would decide the asylum cases right there at the border. So it wouldn't get gummed up in the courts. They would really speed things up. >> It's the immigration system. It means more border patrol agents. It means we're Jalen, it more judges. It's overhauling the entire system, not just a wall, not just, let's add some more people that can say yes, no, yes, no, it's an entire over Paul, I think there should be a wall I really, really do. >> Trump's legal troubles at eight criminal charges in four separate criminal cases? Does any of that as you sit here still undecided, does any of that have any impact on whether you will end up supporting him? >> Every person works for the government from the private in the military to the president, takes the oath to support and defend the concentration. Yeah. Trump doesn't do that >> Trump does not do that. He did not respect the laws of the nation if they get in his way, I think he's a Crumbley agree and a crook and a manipulator in a bully. And so all of those things run through my mind is I think about do I really want this person representing the United States? >> Are you comfortable with trump's serving as president even if he ends up being convicted felon no, I don't know. >> Is that a possibility? >> Yes. As a felon? >> Yes. Yeah. At the gada here, it's a very real possibility why >> Do you think either Biden or trump are many? Italy fit for office? They're both way too old to be there >> Once too childish, wants to senile. What do you, what do you all need to hear to pick a candidate >> Michelle Obama come in. >> I need a new candidates slide. Yes, I really do >> Maybe Kennedy being a stronger yeah. Yes I agree with that.\n>> I agree with actually both of you. >> Yeah. We >> Need somebody new to come in and shake things up. >> Randi, those women sound really disappointed in their choices. Did they say what their hvo will ultimately come down to >> What interests in at least two of the women told us, in fact, they may not vote at all, but they are all really disappointed, as you said, in their choices and trump and Biden. But on the flip side of that, they're also all very intrigued by Robert F. Kennedy the junior who is running as an independent. In fact, one woman who really strongly disliked Donald Trump told me that if trump were to choose Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As his running mate, she would vote for trump. But really understand I get a sense from these women that they're not looking to hear something specific from Biden",
    "We begin tonight with Haiti and CNN's David Culver, who has been trying for days to get into the country, is just now arrived. The country is in chaos with prime minister stepping down. Gangs now controlling the streets and ordinary Haitians, millions of whom are going hungry, trying to survive. CNN is the first major news network to make it into Port au Prince since this latest outbreak of violence. David Culver joins us now from there. What is the situation like on the ground? Hey there, Anderson. You know, we landed about 3 hours ago. It's tense, but there's also this eerie quiet that you feel like you're making your way through the streets. We were only driving for about 10 minutes or so compared to when we were here three weeks ago. I expected to see at least some livelihood out on the streets, some activity. There were no street vendors. Folks were hurrying along. And one local Haitian told me it's because we were getting close to curfew at 6:00 and you run the risk if you are out after curfew not to be ticketed or cited or anything, but rather potentially to have police opened fire on you. I mean, that just tells you the type of situation that this city is dealing with. And really this country has found itself and it is a crisis that they have not faced in years. It's unprecedented for many aspects of the city in particular. And then when you look at some of the most difficult aspects, you're talking about food insecurity and health care. So if you break down the health care, it's 80%. According to one local hospital executive of hospitals in the city that are shuttered. And many of them have been ransacked. They've been looted. Some of the medical workers themselves have been targeted by gang members. So they're living in fear. And then the food insecurity is a growing concern. You have officials who are saying that you've got about a million people who are a step away from famine. Why is that? Well, weeks parents to just the logistics of trying to get to where we are now. And that is you've got roadways that are blocked by gang activity depending on the hour you have to reroute and figure out another way around. It just shows you how quickly evolving this situation is, Anderson. And you've even got communities that have started to barricade themselves even more so than we saw three weeks ago and have created essentially self-defense brigades, according to locals, and are carrying guns more than I've seen on the streets here, certainly from the last visit, just to make sure that the gangs don't get any closer and try to take over territory. So who is in control in Port au Prince in the capital? Yeah. Right now, it does feel like there are almost factions within the city, if you will. I mean, it feels like there are aspects that have contained themselves and basically protected their own communities, if you will, not only physically and in putting up the defense, but also just kind of operating on their own neighbors, looking out for neighbors, if you will. And outside of that, there are, you know, some aspects that are able to continue just with some of the, you know, the state of government and police protection. But then, you know, you can hear it on and off at times. You'll have moments where gunfire will just erupt. And it shows you that, you know, these are times that are just totally unpredictable. And so for that reason, you've got people who are sealing themselves in their homes and who haven't left in the past couple of weeks. How difficult was it to get into the country? Yeah, I mean, this was a huge challenge and the logistics of six days waiting out in the Dominican Republic, you know, trying to go through a lot of bureaucratic red tape at times, of course. But that just shows you what the Dominican Republic and Haiti officials were trying to navigate to so as to get the foreign media. And now we happen to be the first ones to get into Port au Prince, which is significant, especially after six days of trying over land crossings, then trying to book certain helicopters to make our way in. And we finally were able to land about 3 hours ago. And this is just a sampling of our trip who are going to be applying to Haiti is going to take one hour to get there. The logistics of this trip alone have been incredibly challenging, to say the least. They're confirming with us something that we've been working on the entire day, and that is the landing zone, trying to figure out where well touched down amidst a very dire situation in Port au Prince. Gunshots, do you hear that? It is already hearing gunshots. Just a few seconds into stepping out of the car after arriving here, Port au Prince. And so that shows you the logistics of trying to get here. And again, six days to make that one helicopter ride. And as soon as it lands, a lot of the folks who are expats trying to get out are, of course, looking to board some of these helicopters and make their way back to the Dominican Republic. But those are the fortunate few, Anderson. Of course, you've got many Haitians here who they don't have that option to leave. And as far as a foreign presence in international aid, I mean, the UN is trying to set up an air bridge, but right now it doesn't seem like that's in effect. And so you've got a city that's essentially cut off from anything that would allow it to stay alive at this point, including food. 90% of the food that comes into this country is is imported. So, you know that that tells you just how significant any sort of supply chain that's cut off. If you think about it, the vast majority of what's consumed here has to come in from elsewhere. Supply lines are just totally blocked. It's making it near a extremely dire situation.",
    "There's breaking news in the 2024 presidential race. Former Vice President Mike Pence declaring tonight that he cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump. CNN's Christine Holmes is following the story for us. Christine, what is Pence saying about his decision? Well, Wolf, it was surprising and unsurprising at the same time, the two men served side by side, essentially. Donald Trump was the boss of Mike Pence, and Mike Pence was one of the most loyal soldiers to the former president up until January six, when he bucked a pressure campaign mounted by the former president and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. Today, no real mention of January six and saying he would not endorse former President Donald Trump. But this is what he had to say. Donald Trump is pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years, and that's why I cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump in this campaign. Now, the former vice president there is pinning it to these conservative values. We know that he also has launched this $20 million effort to secure conservative values. He's really trying to path chart a path for himself as this Reagan conservative within the Republican Party that really has started to come completely under former President Donald Trump. But while he doesn't mention Trump but his behavior right away or at all, you have to remember what happened when that Pence entered the race, which was essentially Donald Trump went after him. He called him weak. He said he didn't have the courage to overturn the election, do what needed to be done on January six and Pence has stood up to Donald Trump on that, essentially saying that Trump is wrong about what Pence's power was on January six, what his power was in terms of certifying the election. It's not that surprising, again, that this is where he ended up, but it is surprising that he unequivocally said in an interview that he is not endorsing him. He could have just ignored the question. He could have said, oh, I'm going to answer that at another time. Instead, he made a decision to say, in fact, I am not supporting my former boss. I am not supporting former President Donald Trump. Very significant moment indeed. Christine Romans reporting for us. Thank you very much. I want to bring back CNN political commentators S.E. Cupp and Maria Cardona. S.E., this is a remarkable shift from Mike Pence, at least by perception. What do you make of him saying he can't endorse his former running mate? Well, it is remarkable. This is a vice president saying he's not going to endorse the guy he served for four years and serve very loyal loyally. That is remarkable. However, pinning the reason on policy disagreements feels a bit like a cop out to say he's now at odds with the conservative agenda. Trump has always been at odds with the conservative agenda, whether that was the debt and the deficit, limited government, family values, protectionism. Mike Pence seemed to be fine with all of that. And in fact, Donald Trump exploded the debt and the deficit with Mike Pence's help. It's just crazy to me that Mike Pence can't say after all of this time, now that he's made it official, he's not endorsing him. It's because Donald Trump is dangerous. It's because he led an insurrection. It's because he's corrupt. It's because he's facing criminal indictments. It's because he's anti America and anti-democratic. He can't say all the very obvious things he has to say. They now have policy disagreements. It's just so mealy mouthed and a pretty, I think, impotent way to end what was once a pretty promising political career for Mike Pence. Interesting, Maria, As all of us remember, Pence was a very loyal vice president to Donald Trump during his presidency. How surprised are you by this? Well, I am surprised because I thought his cowardice would continue since it has been a reality up until now. So why now, I suppose? And frankly, I would have had a lot more respect for him had he said I cannot in good conscience endorse someone who called for his MAGA supporters to murder me, because that's exactly what Donald Trump did. And so moving forward, you know, look, it does give Democrats a talking point by saying Donald Trump's own vice president did not endorse him, does not believe he is up for the job. And so that's one thing that it gives us. But at the end of the day, I really don't think it matters because let's remember, Mike Pence doesn't even really have his own base because he never was really able to stand up for what he believes. SC Do you think this decision by Pence could potentially impact independent voters out there, or maybe even Republicans who are skeptical of Trump? But honestly, I mean, as Maria just indicated, Pence has no constituency. He's really irrelevant in the Republican Party. And listen, I mean, a bunch of us are, but he's he's made himself irrelevant because in carrying Trump's water, he turned off principled conservatives like me. But in not carrying it all the way across the finish line on January six, he become became traitorous to the rest of the MAGA Republican Party. So I'm not sure his opinion matters all that much. And for independents and moderates, they're certainly not taking their lead from Mike Pence's, you know, you know, political compass, because we've we've not really seen it point do north this entire time. It's interesting, Maria. Mike Pence referenced January 6th during that Fox interview. We all remember him having to be evacuated from the Capitol as the rioters were storming the building and chanted for him to be hanged. Do you think Pence would be declining to endorse Trump if not for the events of that day? You know, that's a really good question, Wolf. I would like to say, again, giving him the benefit of a whole lot of doubt here that maybe he does believe that Donald Trump has turned around on conservative principles. But to his point, he did that for four years with Mike Pence, his help as vice president. And so that's why I said earlier that I think I would have more respect for him had he made that issue, had he made January six, the fact that Donald Trump is dangerous, that he tried to steal an American election, that he inspire the MAGA folks to come and attack the Capitol, murdering policemen, calling for murdering the VP if he had led with those those reasons, Wolf, I would have had a lot more respect for him. And maybe we could say, well, that was the reason that was the red line in the sand for Mike Pence. But then again, why did it take so fricking long? Maria Cardona and S.E. Cupp to both of you, thank you very, very much.",
    "Donald Trump is back on the campaign trail this weekend after officially clinching the Republican nomination, just days after hosting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at Mar a Lago. Trump heaped praise on the autocrat whose crackdown on the press in his country restricted LGBTQ rights and opposes NATO's support for Ukraine. It's not the first time Trump has praised Orban or other dictators around the world. There's nobody that's better, smarter or a better than Viktor Orban. President Xi is a brilliant man. Putin Very smart. Kim Jong UN, who had a good relationship with is a tough, smart guy, which got us to wondering what's with Trump's affection for a strong man? He's watched Godfather two many times. I don't know. He's just a bully. And so he likes bullies and he's not as good as it as they are. So he's caused and he's cosplaying bullying. He likes that dictator. He has ambitions himself. Or do you think he just is impressed by what they get away with? He has ambitions himself, but he'll never be able to do it because he's he's not them. We'll see. Maybe he will. Maybe he will. I don't know. Reihan, how do you explain Trump's praise for dictators and apparent pride in getting along with them? I honestly think that Donald Trump thinks of himself as a dealmaker, and he loves people who are willing to kiss the ring and willing to praise him and people who are adversarial. He goes cold fast. So it's not just dictators. Shinzo Abe, back when he was prime minister of Japan, made a big show of currying favor with Donald Trump. He loved Shinzo Abe. Zelensky You know, Vladimir Zelensky of Ukraine is someone who actually Donald Trump does not in fact, say negative things about because he thinks of Zelensky as someone who did not work hand in hand with the Democrats of a deal. Why do you think he's not bothered by the fact that they run autocracy? Because he is someone who is really self-focused. If he thinks that he's got a deal. Yeah. There you go. And if he thinks he can cut a deal with someone, he can woo them with his words, which is what he was always doing as a dealmaker, as a real estate mogul. That's his mental model. That's like code for narcissism. I'm just. I just. But Trump does fancy himself a strong man in certain ways. And the difference between Trump and G and Putin is, one, the self-discipline factor. But two, that our system of government won't allow it. And I do think we have to look at the difference between words and actions here, where Joe Biden has taken very maximalist rhetoric toward some of the toward some of these countries. Trump may have kissed up to some of these dictators rhetorically, but if you take Russia as an example, his policies actually were quite hardline. Well, I want to I want to pick up on that, because Trump says that getting along with Putin was a good thing and notes that Putin didn't invade Ukraine on his watch. Take a look. We are a nation that allowed Russia to devastate a country, Ukraine killing hundreds of thousands of people, and it will only get worse. It would never have happened with me as your commander in chief. And for four long years, it didn't. Lulu did Trump's Putin strategy, Whether you like it or not, did it work? I would say it is very difficult to know what was in Putin's mind about when he took the action that he did. But there is another argument that says that because Trump weakened Naito, it was actually right picking for Putin to act, to push into Ukraine, because you had, in his view, a weakened naito, you had a new president and possibly the best chance that he would have had to push in and take over the country they always wanted. But the fact is, Trump points out quite correctly, that Putin moved into Ukraine under Obama. Putin moved into Ukraine under Biden. Putin didn't move into Ukraine right under Trump. So does Trump have a point? Russia has perpetrated two major acts of aggression in the past decade. Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 and Russia invaded Ukraine two years ago. Those happened under Obama and under Joe Biden. Under Trump, he may think that he got along with Putin and said nice things. In reality, he pulled out of the Iron F treaty. He provided lethal aid to the Ukrainians and those were on the ground deterrence that his predecessor and his successor did not do. So the key thing is to make sure that, you know, you can have conciliatory rhetoric, but it has to be a kind of iron fist with a velvet glove. You have to have that other part where you have folks around you who are willing to be hawkish, willing to be tough. Trump had that in his first term. The question is, if he wins a second term, will that also be true? Because a lot of those foreign policy cases, Putin's will not be around. They come on, he looks like a puppet to Putin. And Putin loves having Donald Trump in office. But it's absolutely the case. The Trump administration ramped up the pressure on Putin during his that may be, but he was waiting for his chance to come in. And that has to happen to be when you have a feckless Joe Biden in office. I don't think that's a coincidence. I just want to move to one other point here, and that is Trump's talk speaking about his affection for strongmen, his talk about being a dictator on day one, weaponizing just one, Justice Department suspending the Constitution. Lulu. Seriously, do you think Trump's talk about dictators is just talk? I don't think it's just talk. And the reason I know that it isn't just talk is because you see actually an entire apparatus around Donald Trump, especially for his second term, that that that lifts up people like Viktor Orban, that talks about Christian nationalism in terms that are honorific and saying that this is a model for America that they need to emulate. And that is, I think, deeply problematic. I don't know that the guardrails of democracy in this country are actually for that. Or do you see some movements towards authoritarianism in a second Trump term? Again, our system won't allow it. Trump If it were up to him, he'd still be in office. He wouldn't have let Biden take office on January 1st, but our system wouldn't allow it. There are a lot of things Trump would like to do. He says a lot of stupid things. Fortunately, thank God. And thanks to the founders, we have a system of government that will not allow him to do all of the things that he would like to do.",
    "As we have been expecting all afternoon since Judge Scott McAfee issued his ruling regarding district Attorney finding Willis and her ability to stay on the case, prosecuting Donald Trump and his co-defendants for trying to overturn the 2020 election. We've just learned that Nathan Wade, the lead prosecutor in that case, has stepped down after this scathing ruling by Judge McAfee. And we've obtained a copy of the letter that Wade wrote to District Attorney Fani Willis, sending his resignation the very first sentence, quote, The furtherance of the rule of law and democracy is and has always been the North star of our combined efforts in this prosecution. Clearly here, Wade taking the step of resigning, in part because he had no other choice. We have a team of reporters and analysts looking at this story now. We want to go to CNN's Nick Valencia is live for us in Fulton County. Nick, the letter here essentially outlining that he's proud of the work that he's done for finding Willis, but that it's clear, according to Judge McAfee, that he needs to step away. Well, Boris, it's official. Nathan Wade is out as the special prosecutor in the criminal case involving the former president and some of his closest allies. I'm looking here at that resignation letter from the Wade Campbell law firm addressed to the Honorable Fani Willis. You read part of that. And I'm going to read a little bit more here. It says, Although the court found that the defendants failed to meet their burden of proving that the DA acquired an actual conflict of interest, I'm offering my resignation in the interest of democracy and dedication to the American public and to move this case forward as quickly as possible. It is a very short resignation letter, but it does add at the end of it that he wishes the funding of the district attorney's office success and safety through this process. It's something, as you mentioned, that we had been anticipating for, you know, all day really since we got this ruling. But now, Boris, it is official. That's right. And let's just be clear about what this order had said right after the evidentiary hearing. We heard from the the judge writing in a couple dozen pages here. The court therefore, concludes that the prosecution of this case cannot proceed until the state selects one of two options. One seemed very clear it wasn't going to happen. The district attorney may choose to step aside, along with the whole of her office, and refer the prosecution to the prosecuting attorney's counsel for reassignment, or alternatively, Sadie Wade can withdraw. Let's bring in Paula Reid to talk a little bit more about this. We were expecting this. It was really a matter of when. It was a matter of when. And this is a pretty classy letter, right? He tries to bring it back to the idea that the most important thing here is the rule of law and democracy reminds people that the nature of this case are allegations that people tried to undermine the outcome of the 2020 election. These are grave allegations and in a pretty tactful way. He also points out the fact that the judge did not find an actual conflict here. They did not find actual corruption or that funny. Finding Willis or Nathan Wade engaged in some sort of scheme to financially benefit off of this investigation. He says, quote, The defendants failed to meet their burden of proving that the district attorney acquired an actual conflict of interest. So this is a pretty well done letter given all of the circumstances. It brings it back to the facts and the law, because at the heart of this is a criminal case that is mostly intact. They just had six counts dismissed, but we knew this had to happen. And this is a pretty classy way to go given everything that's happened over the past few months. And to your point, he redirects the attention away from the question of conflict of interest, which has been settled away from the controversy surrounding the romantic relationship and focuses on the question of Donald Trump and his allies allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election. He says that he's offering his resignation in the interest of democracy and dedication to the American people. We want to go to Norm Eisen, who is standing by. Norm, your reaction to the news that this is now officials that Nathan Wade has stepped aside in the Fulton County prosecution because he's doing the right thing here. This relationship was never smart. We've discussed from the start that likely was not a legal or evidentiary basis for disqualification, but that Wade had to go. That's been clear for many weeks now. He's done it. I do think it speaks to his commitment. There have been so many false things said about him that he was not a highly qualified lawyer coming to this case. That's been proven false, that he didn't do a good job on the case. That's not true either. He defeated with the team. He led some of the best litigators in the country in a series of pretrial skirmishes. He got four guilty pleas. But once this controversy emerged, he had to go. It's the right thing to do. It's a strong and good order by the judge. I'm glad to see Wade and the DA's office acting fast so we can return to getting this trial scheduled, which is what a majority of the American people would like to see happen. Norm, stay with us as we head back to Atlanta and Nick Valencia, where you, Nick, are tracking a new development. What can you share with us? Well, look, Wade was an instrumental part of this case. He was with Bonnie Willis for 865 days to be exact, and part of the team that secured 19 indictments, including against the former president and also for guilty pleas. And now we have our hands on the response from Finally Willis to Nathan Wade's resignation letter, and she highlights some of those accomplishments by her leader, former lead prosecutor. I want to read part of this letter here now. It says, quote, I will always remember and will remind everyone that you were brave enough to step forward and take on the investigation and prosecution of the allegations that the defendants in this case engage in a conspiracy to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election. Funny, Willis goes on to say, others who were considered were understandably concerned for the safety of themselves and their families that would arise from their acceptance of your role. You were the one who had the courage to accept the role, even though you did not seek it. Just very quickly, I think this other paragraph that follows up is also important. She says, You are an outstanding advocate in the 865 days you served on this case, you completed a thorough investigation that required the use of a special purpose grand jury to compel the testimony of witnesses inside and outside of Georgia, including litigating in eight states, the District of Columbia and the United States Supreme Court to obtain critical testimony. So a very complimentary letter back by Phonte Willis to this breaking news that we have here that Nathan Wade, as we expected, is out as a lead prosecutor in this case. Brianna. A glowing review of Nathan Wade's work on the case. Nick, please stand by. We also have Jen Rogers standing by. And Jen, Norm alluded to the idea of how this case now moves forward. So Nathan Wade is tendered, his resignation. What do you think comes next? Well, next, they'll continue with the process of trying to get a trial date set and moving towards that trial date. You know, they've been engulfed in this controversy for weeks now, and that's kind of put everything else on the back burner. But finding Willis and her team, we're looking for initially an August trial date. I don't think there's any way that's going to happen, but they're now going to shift their attention to trying to get Judge McAfee back in the mode of scheduling them a trial date so that they can move towards a date certain. And of course, to the extent that Nathan Wade was going to be involved in those preparations for trial, they'll have to replace him in order to move forward. In that vein, once they get a trial date. Yeah, and she has certainly been admonished in this legal win for her. To be clear, she will remain on this case. But some blistering comments from the judge. Do you think that's going to change in how she proceeds here, maybe in style or tone? Well, I do hope that she takes to heart some of what the judge said. You know, he criticized her for the unprofessional nature of her testimony. He said that her judgment was poor in this whole thing. So, you know, I do hope that she takes those words to heart. There also was some sharp criticism of the church that she gave in this case, including playing the race card, suggesting the defendants were playing the race card. So I do hope she carefully reads and absorbs the words of Judge McAfee, who seems to me to have been very reasonable in this ruling, and that she does have that governance going forward. I mean, this particular controversy is behind her. But the judge even suggested that defendants should fight. Looks like we have a technical issue, but I will finish the thought for her with Paula Reed. It seems like Judge McAfee set the table for a potential gag order against District Attorney Willis. Yeah, and that's pretty shocking because usually prosecutors don't make statements about cases that they're working on. You know, they're not sparring with defense counsel on the witness stand. I mean, the idea that you would have a prosecutor under a gag order, that's pretty extraordinary. But it also speaks to how the judge views her conduct in his opinion, he called it, quote, unprofessional. And look, these are pretty classy letters, responses. Trying to bring it back to the facts of the case. But another fact is that these two prosecutors chose to have a romantic relationship while they were overseeing the most high profile state level criminal investigation in the land. As the judge said, this was bad judgment. And in an effort to suss out whether this was an actual conflict or an appearance of conflict. The judge even called into question their credibility. This is such a forced error that now casts, as the judge described, a cloud over this case. So the way they've handled today, the judge's order has been has been really impressive with their conduct over the past year or so, has really put this case not in the greatest of places and still an open question as to whether they even go before the election, because all of this prompted a delay.",
    "The judge hinted a gag order may actually be necessary for Fanny Willis. Tell us why and what would that and how would that happen? Yeah, that's a really remarkable part of the ruling. It's sort of towards the end and it's the B storyline, but it's important here. Now, this refers to the church speech that I think Paula referenced earlier a few days after the defendants made this motion to disqualify Fanny Willis. She went in public in a church with cameras rolling and essentially said that the reason that this motion had been brought was racism. And the judge says in his ruling that that was a legally inappropriate statement for the DA to make. He's absolutely right. A prosecutor cannot make inflammatory public statements about the defendants. They're the ones who have their rights at issue. And the judge basically said it may be necessary to put a gag order on the D.A. and that tells you something. I mean, look, Fanny Willis has made, in my view and in the judge's you improper public statements throughout this case. She's given dozens of public interviews She's given her opinion on Donald Trump's guilt before the grand jury even voted on this, which is improper. And so it's pretty rare. I don't think I've ever seen it before where a judge has said we may need to slap a gag order on the prosecutor. Prosecutors are supposed to operate under gag orders anyway. Prosecutors like to say we do our talking in court here. Finally, Willis has violated that principle and the judge has taken note of it. The judge did call comments that Willis made in January at an Atlanta area church about the case legally improper. He said a gag order isn't the question before the court, but I wonder if you thought he was basically saying he might be inclined to grant one if he's asked to do so based on public comments she's made about the case What's really important to understand about that dynamic of the opinion is that we don't want DA's to ever not even remotely discuss the facts innocence or the, you know, the allegations of wrongdoing in a substantive way in the public eye. And so we don't want to taint the jury pool what Fanny was did in her church speech was speaking very broad generalities. And that happens a lot because DA's in Georgia, and as is the case in many states, are partizan la elected officials. So they will make campaign speeches, they will make appearances in the public and talk about their philosophies generally. But what she did here for Judge MacPhee was a step too far in impugning the character of the defense attorneys and perhaps coloring the view that people in Fulton County, the jury pool here, would have of a case that that's been brought against Donald Trump and his allies in an improper way. So I think she's she's been warned pretty significantly by Judge McCarthy to not step out of bounds and to really only speak through legal filings in terms of effecting a jury pool. He seemed to say or he said in this filing that there's enough time between now when this has been this decision has come out and when jury selection selection will begin, that it's not going to affect that He says it shouldn't get in the way. But what if potential jury members have heard about this, about this evidentiary hearing Do you think that could be a factor in jury selection? They may be asked about the voir dire process, which is the process by which we screen potential jurors through was going to be complicated no matter what, in large part because this case is so salient and so politically polarizing, it'll be very hard to find a panel of jurors who don't have some kind of, you know, pre or gained notion of what this case is about and who can adjudge the evidence fairly and impartially. That was always going to be an issue. But I think time is to the the the DA's benefit here and to everybody. The entire judicial systems benefit here because people have a fairly short memory. And that's especially true in a year like 20, 24, where there will be so many political issues, so many trials that Donald Trump has in other places, that this might be just a blip in people's memories. In the long term. By the time we get to a trial which may be very late 20, 24 or even early 20, 25 at this rate that's your expectation she's pushing for August but that's what you expect on timing There's a lot more that we have to go through, I think, before we can talk about an August trial. Two things are true. There are other important pretrial motions that are still under consideration by Judge McCarthy. One of them being one about prosecutor, about presidential immunity and the supremacy clause, which is related to a case that the Supreme Court will hear next month. So he may want to hear what the Supreme Court has to say about that before he weighs in. And that might take some time. And there are other sundry issues that have to be addressed. And the other important key dynamic here is Donald Trump can't be in multiple places at once. So if there are other criminal trials that are happening in the summer or early fall, then Fort County will have to wait their turn. It's not implausible that we'll have a late summer trial, perhaps. But I think at this point, it's impractical. All right. Professor very interesting, especially there on the timing. We appreciate it. Professor Anthony, Michael, Chris, thank you. Let's discuss the case now with national security attorney Bradley Moss. Bradley, thank you so much. For being with us. So Judge McAfee here saying that there is no effective conflict of interest, that the relationship between Fannie Willis and Nathan Wade was not relevant to the charges against Donald Trump and his co-defendants. But he does say that there was an appearance of impropriety that must be remove What's your main takeaway from that ruling? Yeah, you know, Judge Mukasey here was pretty evenhanded ruling. He basically decided, I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here. There was a bunch of smoke there, certainly a stain on the reputation now of Nathan Wade and Fannie Wells and of this prosecution. From an optics standpoint, but for as a purpose of as a matter of law in terms of the evidentiary standard that these defense lawyers had to meet, they simply didn't have the proof that there was an actual conflict of interest, that there was an actual financial material benefit tied to Fannie Willis in prosecuting this case that would mandate disqualification. But he he agreed with the idea that because there is this stain on the case, that because there's the appearance of impropriety, someone has to go. And that's almost certainly going to be Nathan Wade. The case will continue on. And the question becomes if this gets to trial, will the voters even remember what happened leading up to it, if it makes it to trial and we have a verdict before Election Day? You said it'll almost certainly be that funny, Will. It stays and hires a new lead prosecutor. How does that process complicate the case? It doesn't seem like this August timeline that we were trending toward is tenable. Sure. So the idea is that she's most likely going to just use relying on her existing team. She's indicated they're ready to go within 30 days. There's no way that's going to happen. At this point, given the various changes in the schedule since that time, especially with the chaos we're seeing out in Manhattan right now with the district attorney. The case in the Stormy Daniels matter. But it's more than likely that what funny Wolf will try to do is use the existing team that was already there, aside from Nathan Wade. They can pick up the slack from that. He would have otherwise handled and they can still aim for an early fall trial. How we're going to figure out this trial schedule for a presidential candidate, given that almost all three of the other cases are certainly going to start no earlier than June or July is something that no one really knows yet. The judges have got to be just gnashing their teeth over right now. Yeah, it is quite possible she doesn't hire anyone else and just sticks with the team that's in place. I do want to ask you about the potential for a gag order because it's something that Judge Mukasey alluded to. He described comments that were made by Willis at an Atlanta area church in January as legally improper I want to listen to some of those remarks now. I hired one white man, brilliant my friend and a great lawyer in Ohio and one black man another superstar, a great friend and a great lawyer. First thing they say, oh, she can play the race card now, in defending Nathan Wade there, the defense argued that Willis was tainting a jury pool. McAfee saying that it's probably too soon, we're too far out from jury selection for that to be the case. But he did say that the time may have arrived for an order preventing Willis from further discussing the case in public. Do you think that is essentially winking at the defense, saying that they should file a motion to impose a gag order on Willis I think it's certainly was suggesting that they should consider it doesn't mean hell necessarily. Granted, we'd have to see what the scope of any gag order would be. But if I'm sorry, Willis, I want to retreat from the limelight of this case right now in the sense that let your line prosecutors let the team you assembled be the face of this case. You're the political face, understandably. You were elected. You're going to always be the face in some manner. But let your team handle the case, prosecute it, bring it to trial. And get a conviction. You want to be in the background as much as possible so that when people think about this case going forward, when they see it possibly going to trial in the lead up to Election Day, they're thinking about the evidence in the case and they're thinking about the allegations against Donald Trump. They're not simply about finding Willis. Bradley Moss, appreciate the analysis. Thanks for joining us.",
    "Former President Trump's legal calendar is not happening in a vacuum. It is happening in the middle of a razor thin presidential campaign. With me to talk about that, CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Laura Coates and Gloria Borger. Hi. Hi again. Jeff, I want you to talk about something that I heard you talking about this morning. I'll give a little peek behind the curtain to us sort of internally, which I thought was such interesting reporting about the way that the Biden campaign is viewing everything that's happening with Trump on the legal front. Look, I mean, not that long ago, there was kind of an assumption that that the former president either might have some type of a judgment by the time voting judgment day comes in November. That is very much an open question. Now. I would say the betting odds are that there may be no a conclusion to any of these cases. But as far as thinking inside the Biden sort of broader world is they are not planning on a conviction. They are not sort of focusing on that. It's out of their control and they have enough challenges to worry about on their own, trying to get people to sort of embrace Joe Biden as opposed to rejecting Donald Trump. But they are no longer thinking that any of these cases in Georgia or here might be resolved. The Georgia case, though, is so interesting because I was talking to an adviser who really is kind of talking this out. Not sure how it plays because it's a local story. And Georgia is a battleground state. We saw last Saturday Joe Biden and Donald Trump were campaigning hours apart, miles apart. We don't know how this plays. This gets so much local coverage in Georgia. It could sort of rally support for Donald Trump or not. But that is one wild card here that was sort of not on anyone's bingo card four years ago when Georgia became a surprisingly Democratic win for Biden. They weren't necessarily expecting that either. But it's not a must win for Biden. But boy, they sure would like it so equal. It's easy for you to it's harder for him to get to 70 without George. Yeah. And it's so interesting the reason why this is a story, because Trump really needed Georgia. Right. Right. Is potentially playing the hall of mirrors. It's a hall of mirrors. Right. It also it just sort of undermines the whole legal system. And, you know, Donald that's what Donald Trump has been trying to do. And his his whole spiel is the legal system is rigged. It's rigged against me. And look at what happened in Georgia with Fannie Willis. And so you can't trust the legal system because she's still going to be prosecuting my case. And she shouldn't be. She doesn't deserve to be there. So in the state of Georgia, as you point out, even though it's a big local story, she's an elected official. The judge is elected it's going to have some legs in this state. I mean, two points, really. On the one hand, Georgia is unique because these were Republicans who fought back against Donald Trump. Brad Raffensperger, Brian Kemp. Right. This was the state with Laura, their RINOs. That's right there. I keep forgetting once they've gone against, they can no longer be a part of the party. That was sarcasm. You know, it wasn't clear historically at that, but that was what makes it unique about about Georgia and also on Tuesday. I mean, even Nikki Haley is no longer in the race She was holding her own against Donald Trump in Fulton County, in DeKalb County, in the Georgia suburbs. Well. Maybe a little bit telling. But finally, remember, Donald Trump's goal is delay, but his real goal was to it's all to go away. That is not happened in Mar-A-Lago. The judge did not dismiss the case, even although he wanted to talk about the issues of an ambiguous, he says, Espionage Act. He wants the funny worst case to go away if she had been disqualified. There was no chance this case is going to go to trial this year. Let alone maybe even at all. And so delay is one thing, but he doesn't want to kick the can down the road. He wants the road to be obliterated. Now, he doesn't want to just delay. He wants to destroy yes. And destroy means destroy people's faith in institutions. And one of those, of course, is a judicial system. Well, that's that's all true. But the other major factor here, he definitely wants to. What did you say? Don't kick the can down the road. Yeah, burn the road. He wants to destroy the rest of the reiterate the road. It was such a good quote that he got some bad later moments. But but, Jeff, a big part of if you kind of go back in time and him announcing at the time that he did in 20, 22 and the way that he has approached his political campaign and his legal campaign simultaneously is all about him personally. I mean, I'm not saying he doesn't want to be president, but a big part of why he wanted to be president and wanted to declare his candidacy early on was to blur the lines. Right. And to make it harder for him personally to be successfully prosecuted because, oh, I'm not just a former president. I am a candidate for president in the future, without a doubt. I mean, this is someone who adds, you know, complete name I.D. He could have jumped in at the last moment the night before the Iowa caucuses. And he could have still won. But the reality is he jumped in first. He wanted to be a candidate for president so he could say that this was all part of the witch hunt, all part of election fraud, trying to block him from this. Such a good point or that you made that Republicans in Georgia stood up to him? It's a little unclear some of those same Republicans will put their jerseys on and vote for Donald Trump in November, but some may not. I mean, so this is why it's such an interesting laboratory in Georgia. This case, if it goes to trial, will be on television every day. It's the only one that will that is different in this as well. And it's also one, should he become president that he cannot do anything about because it's a state case. So this is the first ruling, really a string of some pretty positive rulings for the former president from all courts. This is the first one that was not in his favor. And it's a big deal. He's been pretty lucky, though, so far. Gloria, I want you to weigh in on this. But you talk to voters all the time. You're out on the road constantly. How much are they tuned in to all things Trump legal? It's a blur. All these cases run together and blur together. The Georgia is an exception. I haven't been down to Georgia for a few weeks to talk to voters or I think that could be different because it's happening there but I was in Michigan and Wisconsin most recently, and voters are it just all runs together. What are the cases, whether or not if you don't like Trump, obviously your support of this, if you do, you think it's you know, he's being ganged up on and then you have as you come in, I want you to listen to Jamie Raskin. He was talking to Manu earlier this week. He, on the one hand said, look like when some of the charges were dropped in Georgia, like that's the way it is. And he's he's making the argument that if you're going to respect that judicial system, then you have to go all in on that. Let's listen for a walk in crime wave like Donald Trump. You can trample every criminal civil disciplinary, ethical boundary you want and then you know that it's going to take time for the justice system to catch up with you. But that's in the nature of justice system based on due process. But we we've got to stick by the rule of law. It's all we've got. Well, right. You do have to stick by the rule of law. And sometimes it's on your side and sometimes it isn't. And I think in these four cases, we might not hear any of them before the election. It is worked in Donald Trump's favor because he wants to delay and destroy and do whatever. And now, you know, in D.C., you're waiting for a Supreme Court ruling and there's nothing you can do to skip over that. You have to you have to wait. And our polls and other people's polls show that the American public does want to get a resolution on at least one of these cases before they vote. They want to know if he's going to be convicted of any of these things. And they now it looks like they may not know. By the way, being a Teflon Don is not that is not the best asset. You're talking about cases in multiple juries because you could have the cumulative effect of jurors being aggravated that this person keeps getting away with it. And they may say to themselves, well, not on my watch what his defense has to guard against that. And as somebody who has prosecuted cases, if you've had that experience.",
    "When I found out I had cancer and I had to go through chemo, I thought, Oh my God, I'm going to be lying in bed drinking food out of a straw. Unable to do anything. Unable to live my life. My normal life. Oh, thank you. This is also my country. There is nowhere to take cover here. All right. All right. Prime time. Here we go. Today is chemo number six of the 16 that I have to pick. It is poison going into your system. So you are being poisoned in order to try to heal you, which I find absolutely. Insane, but that is the way it is. Everybody gets different drugs and has different issues. But for me, the first couple of infusions, I was fine. In a way I could not have imagined. And I don't want to be sick. So far, I haven't been I mean, actually sent to my doctor Is this trick working? I felt like Superwoman by the fourth one. I felt pretty bad for a while. I still went to work, but there were a couple of times one in particular. I said, Can you guys bring the bucket over here? I might be sick. Just making sure you work We decided to try cold capping, which is something that you can you can do to try to save your hair. Let's take a deep breath. Normally 60 to 80% of your hair goes after your second infusion. And if you're lucky, into your third hour. I'm just kidding. So I was prepared for it. There's nothing I can do about it. And that doesn't look like a lot, probably, but it sure feels like it. There is a sick In my case, stage three 60 to 70% survival rate. I've got several more months of chemo. Once that finishes, there is a break so that your body sort of deals with the residuals of the chemo treatment. And then I will get a double mastectomy. I will get radiation. I mean, it feels like it's never going to end, but it's just one treatment at a time. I know cancer is not supposed to be funny, but what can you do? I got a laugh. Be kind to yourself from the time, really of puberty for me. I've disliked the way that my body is when I asked my body to take in poison on a regular basis and ask my body to survive. There was one day I was in the gym, I picked up my phone and I'm thinking, this body, this body that I have mentally tormented I apologized to it. I was really neglecting myself. And that makes me sad. That I was sort of taking advantage of this body and not giving it back what it needed. Okay. Does that piece out this is a real lesson about what real self-care is and real self-care to me is. I'm drinking my water. Drinking enough water is going for a run. Is being able to work out letting yourself be mad letting yourself cry. And why am I just learning this now at 50? I don't know. Because I'm trying to tell people that I'm visiting with you people. We say all these things like, make sure you live every day like it's your last work in nine to five. Most of us are just not capable of doing that. Now I actually do that to cure cancer. I'm ready for severe.",
    "This is what I'm reading in, in the language. The prosecution of this case cannot proceed until the state selects one of two options. So very clear there. He is saying you cannot go forward unless what are you has to go either the D.A. and with her the entire office. Or Nathan Wade. This will be the easiest decision in his office has ever had to make. Obviously, Nathan Wade will go. And the judge in his ruling says essentially this is necessary to preserve public confidence in this case. He says there's enough of an appearance. There's enough of, as he says, at one point, an odor of mendacity around this case. Interesting phrase that something's got to be done to at least clean up the public schools. Yes. Of mendacity, whatever that tells us. But guess what? You're talking. This thing was so messy. And that's what Michael Moore is saying. And this could have been nipped in the bud. Right. Again, it's really important to underscore here the big takeaway finding Willis stays on the case. The DA's office keeps the case. The case can carry on. That is far and away the headline. They have survived, but not without substantial damage. I mean, there is some really stark language in this ruling. The judge calls out the DA's, quote, tremendous lack in judgment, the odor of mendacity, he says that the speech, the public speech she made in the church was, quote, legally improper. And the judge even says in the ruling it may be time for a gag order on the D.A. because she keeps on making improper public statements. He leaves it out there. He doesn't say I'm issuing one, but he raises the possibility of a gag order on the D.A.. I mean, look, there's gag orders in Donald Trump, right? Because we collectively fear that he may be tainting the jury pool and now the judge floats the same possibility. So the DA's office has survived. The case survives. It will roll on. At what pace? We'll see. But but there's some damage done here. Joining us now, CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reed, national correspondent Kristen Holmes. And on my left, chief legal analyst Laura Coates, legal analyst Ellie Williams. I am not used to having so many people with I when I'm doing I mean, this is it's an embarrassment of riches. I don't know who to go to first, but I'll go to Paula first. You've been leading this coverage a good part of this morning. I have no idea how. I mean, I guess she stays on the case. Funny. Well, it stays on the case, but it just feels like this is not good. It just feels I mean, let's read this one part of the ruling. This finding is by no means an indication that the court condones this tremendous lapse in judgment or the unprofessional manner of the district attorney's testimony during the evidentiary hearing. I mean, that it just sounds like, yes, the case continues but it almost feels like is it going to hobble along? I mean, what do you think? Well, let's put this in the larger context. At some point, Trump's lawyers are going to have to defend him in a court of law. Maybe not this year. Based on the facts in the law, but until that, they have two goals. The first is to delay all four of his criminal trials. The other is to sow distrust in the criminal justice system. And what we've seen down in Fulton County over the past few months has helped him with both of those goals. In this language today, where the judge described Funny Willis as having, quote, a lapse in judgment calls are unprofessional on the stand since she repeatedly made bad choices and insinuates that she lied. He described a significant appearance of impropriety that infects the current structure of the prosecution team and basically says, look, your office can recuse or you can get rid of your lead prosecutor. So, yes, this is about finding Willis, his fate in terms of leading this There's something much more at stake, which is trust in the judicial system. So anyone who says that this is a win for Fannie was it's a technical victory. But I would argue this this helps the Trump team politically. And Christian, I do want to ask you about the political implications, because Trump's going to run run wild with this. But Laura, I mean, I have to go to you. Why let her stay on the case if you're going to go after her in this way so publicly? Tremendous lapse of judgment and so on. I mean, it sounds to me like a gift to the defense if they want to appeal, they want to tie this up further. This absolutely gives them ammunition to try to attack her credibility and taint their own version of the jury pool to try to undermine it. This is in combination with an earlier this week decision to remove and dismiss some of these charges for not having been what they call properly pled. They were to insufficient to lacking in detail to have them be able to prepare for a defense. You combine those two things. They will use this to suggest that she should not be trying this case. But if she is, then, hey, she's not good enough to actually have a burden of proof, Matt. But this is actually pretty extraordinary. As a result, the judge did not have the legal basis to say that an appearance of a conflict was enough to remove. He does talk about the fact that there was the lapse in judgment. He does not condone it, but they did not meet their burden. Those who are moving to this particular case, disqualifier, to say that this goes to the heart of the defendant's ability to get a fair trial. All of these salacious details and we leaned in for the gossip I certainly did. But when it comes down to it, none at this trial had anything to do with the underlying facts of this case. Even the speech that has been referenced by Nick Valencia and others, where he talks about what they called the playing the race card, identifying, why are you just going after one of my one of my prosecutors, not the rest of them, Even that, he said, did not rise to the level of disqualification. So, yes, this takes a hit. But he did say they are so far removed from the actual jury selection to provide a permanent taint on a jury pool. He knows this is down the road. Amnesia might set in. Yeah. And it may. And Eliot, it may help. Finally, was his case I mean, if the case is delayed to some extent because it does provide a little distance between now and when this case gets going, I suppose. I mean, that like that would be music to the Trump team's ears as well. But I mean, I just want to show the part that the judge says about Nathan Wade. I mean, this is also brutal, patently unpersuasive of explanation for the inaccurate interrogatories he submitted in his pending divorce case indicates a willingness on his part to wrongly conceal his relationship with the district attorney. As the case moves forward, reasonable members of the public could easily be left to wonder whether the financial exchanges have continued to result in some form of benefit to the district attorney, or even whether the romantic relationship has resumed. And as Laura was saying, this has nothing to do with I mean, as funny will have said, I'm not the one on trial. Trump and these co-defendants are on trial, but the judges goes after. Finally, also, Nathan, wait. If they were as if they were on trial. And there's a there's other language along those lines where and I was just trying to find it here. Yeah. Whereas I think that the possible Menendez Cassidy I think is the word he uses, referring to finding Rose and Nathan Wade. Now, it is important for any judge writing an opinion like this to substantiate how he's landing it at the decision he's coming through. And some of that is assessing the credibility of witnesses. Can I, as the finder of fact in law, actually believe the things that are being said to me now? A number of these statements sort of toe the line of is this a credibility finding? Are you taking a pot shot at the prosecutor? And there were a few. So, for instance, one of them referring to Fanny Wells being unprofessional on the witness stand serves no purpose whatsoever. It doesn't speak to the witnesses actual credibility. I'm sure they're angry right now. Don't get me wrong. That's great. Like Laura says to the human element of all this, some of the intrigue and so on, but it doesn't help. Now, I have to push back on you a little bit, Jim. That even if this trial is delayed, nothing in here helps Fanny Willis and her case. And to the point that Chris and I were talking about a little bit earlier, a lot of this actually sort of hurts the credibility of the office. That said, there's a difference in the legal correctness and sort of the political or moral correctness of all of that. And legally, this is sound and you do not have a basis for removing this prosecutor from the case. But there's all kinds of political stuff that we do and this is happening in the middle of a political campaign, obviously, for a stand. And Trump is going to run wild with us. He's already been doing it out on the campaign trail at these rallies, talking about he was a Nathan Well, he's almost sounds like Strzok and Lisa Page. It's the same. It's very, very similar. And look, I'm sitting at a table with lawyers and I am not a legal person, but I can tell you, you already legal person. I have to say, he is really. That's what happens. So when I look through this, I see how Donald Trump's team is going to take advantage of it. Now, they said what you would expect for them to say, which was that they were disappointed. We got a statement from Trump's lawyers that you stayed out. He essentially said while respecting the court's decision, we believe that the court did not afford appropriate significance to the prosecutorial misconduct of William and Wade, including the financial benefits, testifying Untruthfully about when their personal relationship began, as well as well as extrajudicial MLK Church speech, where she played the race card and falsely accused the defendants of their and their council of racism. Then he continues and says, We will use all legal options available to continue to fight to end this case, which should have never been brought in the first place. That's exactly what you would expect, right? They're not happy. Bonnie Wolf gets to stay on the case that moving forward, they want this case to be dismissed. However, when you actually look at how they're going to use this, Donald Trump is going to repeat some of these lines in rallies and I'm getting a lot of pushback already online for saying that, you know, Donald Trump is going to use this and his supporters are going to eat this up. But this is what I've seen for the last several years. Donald Trump takes it just stay true who push back on the Internet. So, you know, Donald, to take the nugget of truth and fact from this report and then we'll blow it up and his people will believe him and not just his people. He will be able to reach other people by using this because that is the tactic he has used since 2016. I will say, I mean, yes, this is, as you mentioned, Paula, a it's a win ish, but there is a lot of good information in here to actually buttress the credibility of Faneuil as it might be surprising. One part in particular, this judge called B.S. on the idea that the people who brought this motion had proven that the money that was given as a salary was the, it was a through line to what was used for the vacation. That was their burden, just like it will be the burden of the prosecutors at trial to make their case. Also, another aspect of here that they said this was the theory of the defense's case and essentially Trump and counsel that they were bringing this case and prolonging this case, an effort to sustain their romantic relationship. Go to West Virginia and drive there or Nashville at different points in time. The judge essentially said, well, that can't be true, that she was trying to prolong that, only she asked for a trial date. And six months after she brought this case, she said that she didn't want to sever these defendants. She wanted them all to stay together. Everything that she was doing was trying to expedite this case, which belies what they were trying to articulate and so on that realm. She has some legs to stand on. I do agree, this judge, if you thought Robert her is one line about Biden was problematic. This is a whole this is a whole lot of her. You know what? I'm sure the office wants to hear it, but I'm suspecting it's one of those. You don't have to go home, Nathan way, but you can't stay here.",
    "All right. Welcome back. It's been six months since an impeachment inquiry into President Biden was launched by House Republicans this morning. The investigation is stalled. There are not enough votes to successfully impeach the president, but Republicans fear ending their inquiry would essentially clear Biden of any wrongdoing. And that's a political message they don't want to send heading into the November election. CNN's Andy Greer joins me now Andy. Good morning. Just that set of sentences Well, they don't want to end this investigation because they don't want to act like they're clearing him. But on the other hand, they don't seem to have enough to actually show that he's done something wrong enough that's worthy of impeachment. Like oh, my gosh. What is going on? I mean, it's a great question. I think when Republicans took the majority and got their committees in January, 20, 23 investigating, the president and his family was a top priority for them. But 15 months or so and they've received over 100,000 documents they've interviewed over 40 people, including Hunter and the President's brother. They're business associates, Department of Justice officials, IRS whistleblowers, and they don't have evidence of wrongdoing. And so the question is how do you land this plane when the expectation was you were going to be able to deliver some some evidence of wrongdoing and then impeachment articles against the president. And so one conversation is about criminal referrals. House Oversight Chair James Comer, who's co-leading this investigation, very much, wants that he's on television talking about it. I've talked him about it many times. But the two other stakeholders in this decision making process for Speaker Mike Johnson and Treasury Chair Jim Jordan are less committal when it comes to criminal referrals. And they say there are still more conversations need to be had. Beyond that, Commerce says he wants to do legislative reforms to address so-called influence peddling. But this is just not where Republicans thought they were going to be this far into their investigation. Well, I mean, Andy, you've covered like every single step of this all the way along the way. And there were high profile missteps and a series of points. I mean, their first hearing and then this issue with the key witness who was arrested for, you know, lying, basically. I mean, in terms of a criminal referral, I mean, what leg is there to stand on? I mean, that's unclear. And they don't say who these criminal referrals be before. And remember, Hunter Biden was so key to their investigation. All of the allegations around the president was built around him. And Hunter came in for his deposition on February 28th. He sat for 6 hours. He answered every question Republicans had for him about his business deals, phone calls, his service overall interactions that his father had with his business associates. And some Republicans even say, you know, Hunter answered our questions. He was, well, prepared. There is no more to really get out of him. What is there? What is the point of doing a public hearing? But Komar is trying to bring Hunter in for public hearing. Hunter to refuse to do that. They're still trying to go after Hunter, though. They just quietly subpoenaed him for his bank records at AT&T. So they're going to try and keep finding new avenues, but nothing has turned up. And the broad policy is something I should note you did this reporting did generate a very lengthy letter from the White House saying that if they write today to to it's clear the House Republican impeachment is over. This was sent to Speaker Mike Johnson The politics of this, I mean, they basically can't they're on the votes for it. They don't have the votes. But the politics and the 20, 24 election looms large over all of this. Some Republicans I talk to you say we know we don't have the votes, we don't have the evidence. Let's focus on things we can deliver to Republican voters and getting Republicans and Donald Trump elected in 2024 essentially. Let's move on. Then you have another camp of Republicans saying let's drag this out as long as possible. There's no incentive to admit we can continue to just find little lanes here and there and just continue to try and hurt President Joe Biden politically. So those are the kind of two camps that are actively discussing this right now. And they haven't come to a consensus about what their timeline is. I mean, I think it's just worth noting that you know, the the whatever artifice used to be around these things that said we're doing this for the good of the country and not for like Raw Politics. It's gone. Right. I mean, that used to be something that was required here and it just no longer exists anywhere. It's great reporting. Thank you very much. This morning, we're waking up to reports in both Politico and Axios of what you can call a Dear Mike letter from the White House counsel Ed Siskel to House Speaker Mike Johnson on the impeachment efforts what they call the floundering impeachment efforts against President Biden. The letter read Stewart Dear Mr. Speaker, I write you today because it is clear the House Republican impeachment is over. Members of the House majority believe the inquiry is, quote, falling apart. It is obviously time to move on. Mr. Speaker, what does this tell you, Stuart, about the shifting politics of the impeachment if the White House is making political hay out of it now? Yeah, look, I mean, Mike Johnson, they're basically sending a letter to Mike Johnson. You know, you may think that we're still going out, but we're not. This whole effort has been tawdry, pathetic, stupid, counterproductive to the purposes of anybody in the United States who wants to try to have a better life because they actually elected these people to govern you know, their world changing, history changing stuff like passing the bill to support Ukraine that this Congress should be addressing And it's extraordinary that they're sitting around like a bunch of stone kids at the end of a dorm room on a Saturday night. The guys who can't get a date trying to figure out ways that they can get revenge on the Republican Party is not a governing party. That's what they're going to show it over and over in different ways. But we have to quit being surprised when they do. Thank you for using a relatable metaphor there, Stuart. Joe, what about what about the impeachment effort here? Can Democrats use this for political gain now? Look, I think the Republicans can't get out of their own way on this stuff. I mean, even the hurt hearing that they they just brought I think, exposed more differences and hurt Trump and made his case. You know, the difference in his case, a guy who who didn't, you know, actually wanted to keep the documents, never turned them over, farted every inch of the way, had his employees move the documents to hide them. All those things are so much different. And so here they bring this, you know, bring in the special counsel in an attempt to resurrect again. The the fact that all Americans know, geez, Joe Biden is an old guy. So they're doing that again, as Stuart says, while there's real things that need to happen here, that they're not like Ukraine, like funding that. So again, that whole hearing, I think, hurt Trump and his cause in the cause of it. And, by the way, hurt a bunch of Republican members of the House who happened to be running again in districts Joe Biden won. So they keep walking these guys down the plank and they're all going to pay for it in November. It's just it's just stupid. It's we're now into this literally the stupidest period of politics that I've seen in my entire career. That's a pretty high bar right there. It's a lot of stupid theories. But I understand what you're saying, Stuart, very quickly, by the end today, Joe Scott McAfee in Georgia will rule on whether Fannie Will, as a Fulton County district attorney, can stay on the case. We don't know how he is going to rule, but if he is removed, she is removed. How much of a political gain is it for Donald Trump, a political gain Look, I think that what happens today is not going to matter as much as what happens when there will be a trial. You know, it could be a good news cycle for Donald Trump, but it's not going to make the fact that he calls up the secretary of state of Georgia on a recorded line and told him to rig an election none of that is going to go away. So I think we have to keep the big picture here. But the Republican Party is led by a guy who is out on bail, literally who was convicted of sexual assault, that a judge classified as rape. I mean, that we don't talk about this as sort of the headline in every election story is just amazing. And every donor to the Republican Party to know you're giving to a guy who is out on bail. Are you good with that? And I just find it extraordinary that the party can fall into this sinkhole. He was found liable in a civil case of sexual assault. But I get your point there. Stuart Stevens and Joe Trippi, thank you both so much for being with us.",
    "Here with me now is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Thank you so much for joining me. Let's start with that potential deal, sir. 100 hostages about are still being held by Hamas. You're sending that negotiating team to Qatar in the coming days to talk about a potential deal. Free hostages in exchange for a six week pause in fighting. As you know, Hamas is demanding the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for roughly 40 female hostages. Are you open to that? Are you close to a deal? Well, time will tell. But Hamas's outlandish demands and I'm not itemizing every one of them now makes that deal a lot more difficult. But I'm we're going to keep on trying because we want those hostages back. We understand also that the one thing that gets Hamas to give them is to give these hostages to us is the continued military pressure that we're applying there. And so we're going to continue military pressure and we're going to continue to try to get those hostages out. And we've succeeded already in bringing half of them out. I hope we continue along that same course. Let's talk about what happened here in the U.S. this week. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer gave a pivotal speech and said you have lost your way and called you an obstacle to peace. Take a listen. The Netanyahu coalition no longer fits the needs of Israel after October 7th. And I believe that holding a new election once the war starts to wind down would give Israelis an opportunity to express their vision for the postwar future. Chuck Schumer is the highest ranking Jewish elected official here in America, a staunch supporter of Israel. What's your response? I think what he said is totally inappropriate. It's inappropriate for a to go to a sister democracy and try to replace the elected leadership there. That's something that Israel, the Israeli public, does on its own. We're not a banana republic. I think the only government that we should be working on to bring down now is the terrorist tyranny in Gaza, the Hamas tyranny that murdered over a thousand Israelis, including some dozens of Americans, and is holding Americans and Israelis hostage. That's what we should be focused on. And as far as what Senator Schumer said, the majority of Israelis support our governments. 82% of Americans support Israel instead of Hamas. But the majority of Israelis support the policies that we're leading. Go into Rafah, destroy the remaining Hamas terrorist battalions, make sure that we don't put into Gaza instead of Hamas, the Palestinian Authority that educates their children towards terrorism and the annihilation of Israel. And and also an enormous majority here, including 99 Knesset members to nine, oppose the idea of ramming down a Palestinian state down our throats. I want. To get to, you know, the. Majority of Israelis. Senator Schumer, the majority of Israelis support the policies of my government. It's not a fringe government. It represents the policies supported by the majority of the people. If Senator Schumer opposes these policies, is not opposing me. Is opposing the people of Israel. Okay. I'm going to get to some of the polls that you cited in one moment, but I just want to make sure that our viewers understand that Chuck Schumer gave the big speech, but he has support in many ways from the president of the United States. President Biden is a self-described Zionist. Even he is starting to distance distance himself from the way you are handling the war. He called what Schumer said a good speech. He said that he shared the concern of many Americans. They aren't criticizing Israel. They're criticizing you and your right wing coalition. Dana, there is a fallacy that is being perpetrated here. And you should take polls. You'll have your own polls and check whether the people of Israel support the policies that I'm being criticized for that is supporting the policies of going into Rafah, destroying a quarter of the remaining Hamas terrorist army. That's like leaving a quarter of the hammer of the Nazi terrorist army in Germany and saying, now we're not going to finish the last quarter and we're not going into Berlin. Most Israelis overwhelmingly support the position that we have to go in. They oppose the idea of ramming down a two state solution or a terrorist state against their will because they think that this will endanger Israel's future. They support those policies that I'm putting forward and to present that as something that is an outlier doesn't represent a majority of the people of Israel. It's simply a fallacy. And I'll tell you, the other part of the fallacy is they're saying, well, most Palestinians don't support the Hamas massacre. In fact, 85% of the Palestinians do support, unfortunately, the Hamas massacre. So they've got to fallacies here. And you can readily check that the majority of Israelis support the policies that I have on prosecuting the war, which is what I'm being criticized for. Well, it's not just me. I think people. Of Israel who believe that we have to have this resolution. I think that I think that we should be criticized, have the policy is not. Align themselves. More. It's the way that you're prosecuting the war. So I'm going to get to that in one minute. But I just want to add a little bit of sort of context to the way that the Biden administration is pushing back. Another way is that the U.S. intelligence community warned that, quote, distrust of Netanyahu's ability to rule has deepened and broadened across the public and then back to the polls. You're talking about support for the idea of toppling Hamas. That makes perfect sense. There were other polls in Israel, three major Israeli television stations, that said what Israelis also support are early elections. That's what I really want to focus on. Here is Senator Schumer not calling to sort of topple the government, but specifically says when the war winds down, will you commit to calling New elections? That's my question. Will you. Donna? Two thirds first of all, what you said is wrong. The vast majority of Israelis oppose early elections until the war doesn't end. We've just had many polls on that. Look, a lot of the polls are, you know. Channel 12 says Channel 12 says 64% of Israelis. But all polls. Show that's not. Now, I'm afraid that they ask them the question, do you support it during the war? And they said. That's not what Schumer's number where he's calling for new elections. When the. Winds down. Well, we'll see when we win the war. And until we win the war, I think Israelis understand that if we were to have elections now before the war is won, resoundingly won, we would have at least six months of national paralysis, which means we would lose the war. If we don't win the war, we lose the war. And that would be not only a defeat for Israel, but a defeat for America, too, because our victory is your victory. We're fighting this. But when you commit to new elections, when the war winds. Down, everything that everything that we hold dear together. Will you commit to new elections? I think that's something for the Israeli public to decide. But it's not it's not something that's look, that's something for the Israeli people to decide. I think it's ridiculous to talk about it. It's like after 911, you know, after 911, you're in the midst of fighting the war against al Qaeda. And an Israeli would say, you know, what we need now is either new elections in the U.S. or if your system doesn't allow, then President Bush should resign and we should have an alternative leader. You don't do that. Well, let's do about why a. Sister, a democracy to an ally. You don't talk about that. What you do talk about is how do we help you defeat what President Biden called sheer evil? You don't just stop after you destroyed 80% of sheer evil. You destroy 70. Percent of sheer evil.",
    "After severe storms and tornadoes hit multiple communities, killing at least three people. One local official says it looks looks like a bomb went off. And now a massive cleanup and recovery operation is underway. CNN's Ivan Rodriguez is there in the hard hit community of Lakeview, Ohio. Ivan, tell us more about what you're seeing. Well, Fredricka, after that powerful F3 tornado came through Lakeview here in Logan County, Ohio, as you mentioned, a lot of cleanup efforts are now underway in the background and we can hear chainsaws. Crews have really been at it all day long trying to clean up some of the debris that you can see behind me. Now, this is just a glimpse, Fredricka, of all the damage that we're seeing across Lakeview. And you can really see just debris scattered everywhere. Feet away from me is a roof that belonged to the home right behind me, a car here. This Honda CRV has been smashed in with its windows blown out. And this this object here, you can't really make out what it is very well. But the person who lives in this home told us that it's actually a dog house that flew out from a next door neighbor that's now on their property. So that cleanup process is ongoing. But moments ago, we were able to step into the home here of Mary and Joe Baker. They told me that they were in their living room when they heard the tornado sirens go off. As soon as the sirens started going off and started heading toward your bedroom. Yes. This is the living room. This is the dining room. At that point, they continue walking through the living room. She leads me into their main bedroom and she shows me exactly in the home where they hid. They both she says she, her and her husband went into the closet of the home. They got their animals, their pets, and just shelter in place. She said They were there for about 15 minutes, but it felt like an eternity. I asked her as well, Fredricka, you know, do you remember the last conversation that you had when you got into that closet? And she told me she just grabbed her husband's hand, she prayed and she asked the Lord, she said to just keep them safe, keep them sheltered, as well as the other people here in Lakeview as well. And if you could see inside from where we're standing, this is the room that we're talking about here. You can see a beam of wood smashed through the side of the wall. This roof's completely caved in. So really, their home has been severely damaged, but they're very grateful to still have each other. And also the fact that the community has really been coming together through all of this pain, all of this destruction, it's going to be a long road to rebuilding. We heard the governor of Ohio mention how the community is going to bounce back. A lot of that he mentioned has to do with the strength of the community here. I also spoke with a contractor who's working for free to make sure that a lot of these roofs are waterproof. So it's just one example of how the community is really coming together after such a painful experience. Right. Lots of concerns, but a real close call for that family and they're counting their blessings. Ivan Rodriguez, thank you so much. All right. A man and his children were trapped in a Wal-Mart during this devastating tornado that hit Indiana. Jacob Hudson says people continue to shop until a Walmart employee rushed everyone towards the produce section. He hid with his family in a restroom until the tornado passed. And Jacob Hudson is here to tell us all about it. My goodness, Jacob, I mean, what a moment. You go shopping and then the next thing you know, you all are taking shelter. So did you know the storm was coming? What happened while you were in that Walmart? Yeah, well, we had no idea the storm is going to be anything like that. Actually, we live about 10 minutes away, and when we left our home, it was actually sunny and nice, our kids playing outside and everything. And we got there. We got to Walmart maybe around 730 a time. We got to, you know, Winchester, the sky definitely turned and it was you could see storms coming in, but we were just shopping like normal and suddenly everybody's phones in the store went off and that was the tornado warning. And we were almost done. So we were actually going to you just try to get home. And then our employee said, Hey, you guys, can you go to the produce area? You know, a storm is coming in to take shelter for now. So some people say in the Kurdish area, some stayed in a office and he put us in a family restroom and we were in there maybe ten, 15 minutes and nothing, nothing was happening. We opened the door, tried to get some air and just hear what was going on. And then suddenly a worker Roshi said, it's hurting right now and came in and dove in there with us. We hurry up and shut the door and within seconds you could just hear wind going crazy and things banging around outside and, you know. So what are the ages of your kids? And while you're in this space, you know, and taking cover, are you holding your kids or are you hovering around them? Describe for me what you instinctively did. Yes, that's basically what we did. We hunkered in the corner of the restroom and even at work or we wrapped our arms just all together. And I was on the floor with my daughter who was at home. And I was you know, I was worried about her, too. And we just said a Hail Mary. And my kids were screaming, crying. You know, we're just hunched down and no idea what's going on around us. Oh, my goodness. Maybe 30 seconds. And then everything just got very quiet and we opened the door and there was that's where you just see debris in front of us, like, oh, my God. So when it got really quiet, what were you and all the other shoppers, employees that were in that space thinking, did you whisper anything to one another? Was it a matter of, you know, is it over? Or do we do we go out? Just take me to that moment. Yeah, that's we actually the the five of us in that restroom, you know, we we waited just to make sure everything was fine. We waited for quite a moment, and, you know, it was more just, okay, it's over. Let's wait till the kids see. We're fine. It's okay. It's fine. We made it. It's okay. They're crying. Yes, they were crying. Screaming. I mean, it's it's something you don't want to see as a father. They wish you could see. Just see the fear in their eyes. And, you know, as a father, you don't want that. And there's nothing you can do to change that. It was a very, very scary moment. And then your impressions once the door opened or once you all emerged from the safe space where you were, I was just kind of shock. Like at first I just seen like trash and debris in front of us. And then I kind of looked around the corner and I seen the doors of the Walmart actually pushed in and some workers quickly moved that door. And after everything seemed to be calm outside, I took a look outside and there it was, just sheet metal, plywood, damaged cars and far into the parking lot, shared. A car was kind of turned over. I mean, it was it was chaos. I mean, and this was littered everywhere. And your daughter at home, how how did she fare and everything? She was completely fine, like I said, Really 10 minutes away. Luckily, nothing happened. Here. She was she was in the bathroom. Ah, a bathtub with a blanket over her. I was trying to comfort her. I was literally more worried about her. Yeah. You know, warning first went off because, like I said, this took time until it hit. And, you know, I'm worried about her, and then it ends up hitting us at the store. Oh, my goodness. Well, she did all the right things, as did you and all the employees and other shoppers who were with you at that Walmart. We're so glad you're able to tell the story of your survival story. Jacob Hudson, thank you so much. Thank you.",
    "As you know, it's been a tough week for the prosecutors trying to put former President Trump on trial, particularly in Georgia, where the lead prosecutor is now no longer on the case. Nathan Way tenders tendered his resignation after a scathing ruling from a judge forced his boss, Fani Willis, to choose between removing her entire office from their election interference case or removing Wade. Now joining me now is Ed O'Callahan. He is a former federal prosecutor. He also was a top Justice Department official in the Trump Justice Department. You also helped to oversee the Mueller investigation. So I'm really interested to get your take on what happened yesterday with the judge in Georgia. So it was a very interesting decision by the judge in Georgia yesterday. He essentially chose to give Fani Willis the option of whether she herself would be removed from the case or the prosecutor that she had appointed in particular to run the the case against Donald Trump and the coconspirators. Mr. Wade essentially resigned, which I think was the right thing for him to do. And so far, he will remain as the D.A. on the case. She now has to find a top prosecutor to to replace Mr. Wade. It is no small matter when when a judge removes a prosecutor from a case. But I think this judge has been doing a pretty remarkable job in the face of what anyone would assess to be kind of a circus in the courtroom. Well, before any trial is to take place. And he's he's dealing with the issues as they come before them, before him, and making rulings that he thinks are in the best judgment to keep the case moving forward. Yeah, young judge, been on the bench just about a year and then has to handle this question of whether her entire office should be disqualified because finally Willis and Nathan Wade had a romantic relationship. The defendants were claiming that she financially benefited. The judge said that they did not actually prove that allegation. But you've been involved in a high profile investigation related to former President Trump. You have to be I mean, basically the pope, right? You have to be beyond reproach. What is your reaction to what transpired here? Yeah, I mean, I think the judge appropriately laid forward some of his concerns, to say the least, about what the evidence in the hearings displayed, which which, you know, were some ethical issues for sure. And, you know, look, as a prosecutor that has the responsibility to represent the people in in bringing a case. You do want to be above reproach. Obviously, we're dealing with human beings. But but the fact of the matter is, you're held to a higher standard. And that standard is when you represent the people of the state of Georgia or in federal court, the people of the United States, that there should not be any any any doubt about the existence of any conflict of interest, even the appearance of a conflict of interest. And what I think we saw was there was plenty of conflict of interest here. And I think the judge did his best, given the difficult facts that were presented before him. I want to turn our attention to Manhattan. The Manhattan district attorney's case against former President Trump was expected to be the first criminal trial. Right. It was scheduled to begin in a week. But in the past few days, they suddenly received tens of thousands of pages of evidence from your old office, the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutors in Manhattan. So now the judge is holding a hearing a week from now to figure out if he needs a new trial date. How does something like this happen where suddenly tens of thousands of pages of evidence are turned over from federal prosecutors to the state prosecutor? Yeah, I have to tell you, Paul, it's incredibly unusual in my experience that given where obviously we know the Southern District of New York had some cases, most prominently the Michael Cohen case and presumably some of these documents are coming from their cache of documents that were developed in their investigation of that case. But that case has been long over. Michael Cohen has already served this jail sentence and he's back out. And so I find it difficult to understand what it was that prevented Southern District from giving the Manhattan days office whatever they were asking for that was relevant either in cometary information or exculpatory, frankly, or even more importantly for the defense. You know, in my experience and as a Southern district of New York prosecutor, there was a strong rivalry with the Manhattan DA's office. Frankly, the only time that, you know, you would keep information from another prosecutor's office that that is representing to you, that they can use it either in a case that's already charged or a further investigate is when I thought I still had investigative avenues to pursue. And I thought that there was something in that cache of documents that I wanted to make sure I ran to ground. Now, I'm not saying that I'm aware of anything like that happening in the Southern District of New York. That's really the only justifiable reason I could I could imagine that they didn't immediately turn it over at the request of D.A. Brack. So look down to Florida, the classified documents case. It's been two weeks now. I've been waiting for the judge to set a new trial date in that case. There are some questions about whether that case will go before November. What is your assessment of that case and whether it can realistically go before the election? And is that a product of the judge or is it just the nature of the case? Yeah, I think that it's going to be difficult in my assessment to for that case to go before the November I go to trial before the November election. There are a number of circumstances that have a lot of bearing on that. One is just the nature of the charges. You know, the judge did rule against Mr. Trump and his effort to dismiss the Espionage Act charges on unconstitutionally vague arguments she did say was without prejudice, which actually can prove a little troublesome for the prosecutor, that they still might have to deal with that down the road. But but she's at least move that along. But in terms of what's what's really the difficult part of that case is all of the classified information that's involved in it. There are procedures in cases involving classified documents. It's Classified Information Procedures Act, which there have been some hearings in that. But but the fact of the matter is, because those hearings take longer. This judge is unfortunately, a little bit unfamiliar with those proceedings. I just think it's going to take longer to hash all that through. And that basically is an asset. The judge has to make rulings when the prosecutor says, yeah, discovery for the defendant to defend themselves against certain allegations that they don't necessarily need access to all the classified material that might be implicated in the case. And she's got to make some pretty strong rulings saying that the defense does not need that. And that's a difficult thing for judges to do there. They are inclined to frankly, provide as much discovery as a defendant wants. But in classified document cases, it's a different beast and she just doesn't have familiarity with it. So I think it's just going to take longer. Another arguably inexperienced judge. All right. So we talked about three of the four criminal cases against former President Trump. The calendar is crowded. It's confusing, it's uncertain. Do you think any of these cases are going to go before the election? Yeah, I do think I do think the Manhattan D.A. case will go before the election. I think that the judge, Judge Marcia, on their has has shown that he wants to push this case forward. I think that they will figure out this discovery. There may be some, quote unquote, bombshells that come out in the discovery, which lead to more motion practice. But that seems like it is teed up to go before trial. And the other case, of course, we haven't talked about is the January six case that is pending before the Supreme Court on the issue of whether the president should have absolute immunity from prosecution. If you look at the timing of that case, it is pretty interesting. They've set the oral argument at the Supreme Court for April 25th. That means it's likely that a decision on that comes out with with the rest of the end of term opinions, which is end of June, arguably, you know, because there's only one defendant that's only, you know, Mr. Trump in that case. There's an argument that that case could be set before Judge Chuck King here, who's also indicated that she wants this to go to trial, you know, sometime late September, early October. It's possible you then bump up against the DOJ policy, of course, of whether or not you actually bring the case doesn't apply here in a criminal trial. They broke that news two weeks ago. I think that there is a frankly, a more typically nuanced common sense application of that of that policy than than what we strictly represented there. I do think that at the end of the day, everything would turn out that they don't push to do that trial before the election as well. But I could see the schedule working out that that that trial does go before the election. Fascinating. We'll have you back to talk about all of it. It's going to be a busy year. Lots of trials, maybe. We'll see. Adam time, thank you so much. Thank you, Paula.",
    "Are looking at images seen earlier in Trenton, New Jersey, which is the focal point right now, where it's believed this suspect may be. And again, in this imagery we saw earlier. You see law enforcement on that second level. You can see to the right of that residence there is a ladder we watched off camera, not live on television, but we saw it off camera. We saw the investigator or the authority walking up to that second level. And you see right here opening, getting into the window and then escorting somebody out. We've since learned, Danny, through your reporting that all the residences, how they're classifying the people in that house, they have all been taken out safely. All right. With this now, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. All right. So. So and this is across state lines, which is why we also love your expertise, because now, you know, this possibly is a federal investigation ripe for crossing state lines. So if indeed this suspect continues to be in there. Talk to us about the priority of events, trying to negotiate with this person or perhaps the priority is really trying to get residents out safely. Now, what possibly is transpiring. So, Fred, you hit the nail on the head there. The first thing, if you have the opportunity to do it and it looks from this compelling video that they had the chance to and took advantage of it, you want to get as many potential hostages, residents or actual hostages out on out of that building and off the scene to safety as you possibly can. And what you're seeing there is a very careful, incredibly dangerous, risky move, but one that successfully evacuated number those hostages. Every time you have a hostage leave the set, the level of risk and danger reduces somewhat. And that is really the thing that law enforcement is focused on going forward as they're you know, everybody thinks about hostage situations in terms of a tactical entry where a tactical team or a SWAT team goes in and confronts the offender or the hostage taker. In reality, that is the that's the option of last resort. It's incredibly dangerous for the law enforcement folks involved and for anybody who's in the house. And so unless people are in imminent danger of serious injury or death, you're going to put that tactical entry off as long as you possibly can. And if you can put it off by engaging with the hostage taker, talking to them, negotiating with them, striking deals for things like food or communications or access to talk to other people, You're going to do that as long as you possibly can. So these things can typically really drag out. If it starts to drag out like that, that's a sign that they do not believe that anyone inside is in imminent danger of of of death or injury. And what about from a public safety standpoint? Because you're talking Trenton, New Jersey, which is, you know, very heavily, densely populated. We're looking at what appears to be a duplex. And while we are hearing the reporting that residents have been safely escorted from that building, you also look at the proximity of that duplex to the next one over and what's likely across the street, etc.. So what is likely happening involving their law enforcement resources about keeping people where they are communicating with other residents in the area evacuating? I mean, what is transpiring possibly? Well, first, you know, the responding law enforcement officers are going to be dealing with city officials to understand based on plans, based on surveys, based on building permits that may have been filed. They want to understand exactly what that target residence involves. How big is it, how many rooms, what's the layout? They also want to know if it's been combined with any of the structures that are adjacent to it, because that would give your subject the ability to move surreptitiously to a different location. So they're going to be doing that in the background upfront as they determine it's safe to do so. They're going to probably interact with each one of those adjacent residents, each one of those structures on that block. And if they can, they want to get those people out of there, evacuate them, take them to a place of safety where they can be cared for and catered to until this is all over. That's not always as easy as it sounds. Sometimes you have you know, you have homes with people who have medical conditions or mobility issues and they can't be evacuated quickly and easily. And so you want to communicate with those folks, maybe give them a law enforcement presence in there in their location to make sure that they are safe, where they have to kind of post up and stay inside. So all of these logistics issues are being addressed in the background while we watch what's going on in front of the House and, of course, on that roof there where folks are doing their work. And Andy, are there federal resources that are being devoted to this right now in addition to the municipalities? No question. And I think you heard at the Pennsylvania press conference that they're they've already interacted with their federal partners at the ATF and also at the FBI. I would expect that the New Jersey officials have done the same thing. As you mentioned, there is an interstate element to this crime started in Pennsylvania, now seems to be centered in Jersey. That's certainly a source of jurisdiction, although I would say carjacking is generally there's there's a federal offense for carjacking because of the mobility involved with carjacking. So there's there's plenty of federal nexus here to involve the resources from the FBI and other agencies, oftentimes in smaller, more rural spots, your federal partners can bring tools and capabilities to a situation like this that you might the local agencies might not have, like hostage negotiators or or high tech surveillance capabilities that can actually give you eyes and ears inside the hostage location. But here you're talking about some pretty big municipal departments, Mercer County, Trenton, Bucks County, in in in Pennsylvania, very close to Philadelphia. So there's a lot of robust law enforcement resources right in that local area. Okay. I also want to invite to this conversation former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey. Also with us, hostage negotiator Tom Verni. And I wonder, Tom, if I could go to you next, because while we're hearing reportedly residents have been safely escorted out, we don't know if there remain any others or anyone who is being classified as a hostage at this point. So what likely is happening right now to make sure that communication is underway with the suspect, while delicately also trying to figure out how to bring anyone out of harm's way? Good afternoon. And a crazy tragedy to be happening on a Saturday. Yeah. And, you know, this is something that, you know, police departments train for and hope that never happens. And as been mentioned by my colleagues, you know, the the idea here is to try to lower the temperature of the room, so to speak. We clearly have an individual who is well armed, unfortunately, and has snapped. So now you have someone who is going through an emotionally, you know, is emotionally disturbed and and has weaponry to harm. He's already harmed other people, probably has no qualms about harming the police, very likely. And, you know, could certainly harm himself. So the idea is, is to try to, you know, at least calm things down enough where the adrenaline starts to dissipate a little bit as best as possible. How do you calm things down? Especially given what you just laid out, you know, the sequence of events that you know, are are being described as very violent. Led to at least three deaths that police are confirming right now. So how does one maintain calm in what is a very erratic situation? Well, on the police side, you know, they're going to be rational thinking, fairly calm people. I mean, they're going to be certainly they're is going to be running a little bit, too, because they don't want to get injured or worse in this situation, because, you know, we have to, you know, work under the assumption that this person feels as if they have nothing to lose. And and if they want to go out in a blaze of glory, you know, they're going to take everybody else with them. And it so that's how the day started. We're just hoping that that doesn't end that way. So, again, you know, the idea here is to try to reason with someone who is who may be, you know, still somewhat unreasonable and de-escalation tactics or of paramount importance here. And it's not it and it's not easy thing to do. You know, usually after, you know, everyone is kind of in a place where they're stationary and they don't feel like they're sort of, for lack of a better term, under the gun to hide somewhere else or to carjack somebody else and flee or whatever it may be, then things start to naturally calm down a little bit. Now, if there's something that they feel that they can use, that this suspect might want, then that's, you know, you try to find something, some sort of common ground, right. To establish that link to, you know, to try to bring that person to a much more reasonable place. And then, you know, as was mentioned before, to get these other people out of it, which they've already done. So that that that's the good part about this is that no one is in imminent danger at this point except maybe the suspect. So bringing the temperature down, that sounds like a gigantic, you know, colossal challenge.",

    " With eight months to go. Historically, support for third-party candidates shrinks closer to the election. People realize they're not going to win. I need to vote for a winner, Pero though. Remember, got 19%. So we have to watch this and see is this\ntraditional or is it like 1992? We've got to watch it play so look, just in Arizona, this is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Support among hispanics, Latinos, 19% that mostly hertz Biden, right, because that's traditionally a more democratic constituency, although there has been a little trickle back to Republicans and recycles younger voters. He's getting 16%. Again, your reflexes that hurts Biden, right? The\nDemocrats mostly get younger voters. Independence is as I said, that's a bit of a draw. There are independent Republican leaning independents, democratic union defense, but look at this. Joe Biden needs Democrats in the city's urban areas. Robert Kennedy's get 11%, but rural voters, that's traditionally you're trump based Robert Kennedy's getting 13%. So both campaigns are going to have to study, that's just Arizona. Bring up Pennsylvania to look at it as well in these key states, absolutely critical to getting to 270. Kennedy gets 6% of Biden voters in Pennsylvania. So if you're Biden campaign say that's a problem. Well, he's getting 9% of 2020 trump voters in Pennsylvania in the city's 9% in the suburbs, 7%. But again, a lot of trump voters in those rural Pennsylvania counties. He's getting 10%. So the the key thing is Anderson both campaigns, eight months, they're gonna have to study in which state is he hurting me in which state might he and the others don't forget the others be helping me and guess what, money you think trump would spend his money just against Biden. Biden's just against trump no. Watch pretty soon. There'll be some ads against Bobby Kennedy. You can count on it. >> John king. Thank you. >> We're now in the state of play that John just touched on in Arizona, specifically, what undecided women voters there are saying about the issues that matter to them this time around. It's part of Randy K is continuing election series, the 53%, which is the average proportion of women voters and presidential elections since 2000 Randy's conversation came during a week that saw vice president Kamala Harris make a stop at a planned parenthood clinic in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the first time sitting vice president has visited an abortion provider. The Biden campaign is clearly looking to make reproductive rights an issue during the campaign. And what's top of mind for the women that Randy talked to? >> Forever >> I don't know why the hell women's reproductive rights or even a political converse. Amen converse ai look at the end of thy >> We have >> To do, you know, potential presidents like you have no business up in my body. Exactly. >> It's not only reproductive rights, their now it's talking about ivf. What is next? I do not want anyone a government official who is a non-doctors, not part of my medical team telling me what and I can and cannot do to my body or what is right for my body, how important our reproductive rights and freedoms to you in terms of choosing a candidate that's my top issue for all of you >> I think it's definitely on the top one or two. And the timelines coming up where me and my husband wanted to start trying and I'm scared for when I start trying and something happens and if I have to make that choice? Left either to die or doctors will go to jail. >> These six women are all independent voters living in the critical swing state of Arizona. And they are all undecided until we brought them together in Scottsdale. They'd never met though all or affiliated with the women's business it's organization. No women can't believe I'm saying it here. >> Like >> Friends and family don't even know this, but I had to have a medical abortion and they were like, it is either your life like or it's this unborn baby. And to rip that a way is not okay. Like we are literally going back so far in history, we have come such a long way we have font such a hard battle and so many people have died along the way. In the fact that we are going to go back to that such a joke isn't it? >> Which candidate do you think would do the best job with the board? >> I'm sorry, we pick on Biden's >> We had to round it do I'm he's like none of the above. Is that what you want? Trump has declined to rule out resuming his contentious zero tolerance policy that led to thousands of migrant children and parents to be separated at the us border in 2018. Why is it always >> Separation of families? Why is that the go to >> I am a child of immigrants my entire family are immigrants. My father is a direct immigrant. He crossed over when he was in his 20s, but he did it the correct way. As a Mexican American, I've lived here and I've known both cultures and it's a struggle on it's like, sorry, it's makes me a little bit emotional sometimes because we are a country of immigrants. But also what Biden is doing by letting mass quantities in. There was already a murder. >> So when you hear trump's say something like, you know, he's going to do the biggest number of deportations in us history. How do you feel about that? >> It breaks my heart I worry about the friends and the family. I am of lighter skin tone. Okay. No one's going to ask me for my documents or whatever. What about my father? He's very dark skinned. >> One thing that binds proposing is through executive action is having asylum officers at the border and they would decide the asylum cases right there at the border. So it wouldn't get gummed up in the courts. They would really speed things up. >> It's the immigration system. It means more border patrol agents. It means we're Jalen, it more judges. It's overhauling the entire system, not just a wall, not just, let's add some more people that can say yes, no, yes, no, it's an entire over Paul, I think there should be a wall I really, really do. >> Trump's legal troubles at eight criminal charges in four separate criminal cases? Does any of that as you sit here still undecided, does any of that have any impact on whether you will end up supporting him? >> Every person works for the government from the private in the military to the president, takes the oath to support and defend the concentration. Yeah. Trump doesn't do that >> Trump does not do that. He did not respect the laws of the nation if they get in his way, I think he's a Crumbley agree and a crook and a manipulator in a bully. And so all of those things run through my mind is I think about do I really want this person representing the United States? >> Are you comfortable with trump's serving as president even if he ends up being convicted felon no, I don't know. >> Is that a possibility? >> Yes. As a felon? >> Yes. Yeah. At the gada here, it's a very real possibility why >> Do you think either Biden or trump are many? Italy fit for office? They're both way too old to be there >> Once too childish, wants to senile. What do you, what do you all need to hear to pick a candidate >> Michelle Obama come in. >> I need a new candidates slide. Yes, I really do >> Maybe Kennedy being a stronger yeah. Yes I agree with that.\n>> I agree with actually both of you. >> Yeah. We >> Need somebody new to come in and shake things up. >> Randi, those women sound really disappointed in their choices. Did they say what their hvo will ultimately come down to >> What interests in at least two of the women told us, in fact, they may not vote at all, but they are all really disappointed, as you said, in their choices and trump and Biden. But on the flip side of that, they're also all very intrigued by Robert F. Kennedy the junior who is running as an independent. In fact, one woman who really strongly disliked Donald Trump told me that if trump were to choose Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As his running mate, she would vote for trump. But really understand I get a sense from these women that they're not looking to hear something specific from Biden",
    "We begin tonight with Haiti and CNN's David Culver, who has been trying for days to get into the country, is just now arrived. The country is in chaos with prime minister stepping down. Gangs now controlling the streets and ordinary Haitians, millions of whom are going hungry, trying to survive. CNN is the first major news network to make it into Port au Prince since this latest outbreak of violence. David Culver joins us now from there. What is the situation like on the ground? Hey there, Anderson. You know, we landed about 3 hours ago. It's tense, but there's also this eerie quiet that you feel like you're making your way through the streets. We were only driving for about 10 minutes or so compared to when we were here three weeks ago. I expected to see at least some livelihood out on the streets, some activity. There were no street vendors. Folks were hurrying along. And one local Haitian told me it's because we were getting close to curfew at 6:00 and you run the risk if you are out after curfew not to be ticketed or cited or anything, but rather potentially to have police opened fire on you. I mean, that just tells you the type of situation that this city is dealing with. And really this country has found itself and it is a crisis that they have not faced in years. It's unprecedented for many aspects of the city in particular. And then when you look at some of the most difficult aspects, you're talking about food insecurity and health care. So if you break down the health care, it's 80%. According to one local hospital executive of hospitals in the city that are shuttered. And many of them have been ransacked. They've been looted. Some of the medical workers themselves have been targeted by gang members. So they're living in fear. And then the food insecurity is a growing concern. You have officials who are saying that you've got about a million people who are a step away from famine. Why is that? Well, weeks parents to just the logistics of trying to get to where we are now. And that is you've got roadways that are blocked by gang activity depending on the hour you have to reroute and figure out another way around. It just shows you how quickly evolving this situation is, Anderson. And you've even got communities that have started to barricade themselves even more so than we saw three weeks ago and have created essentially self-defense brigades, according to locals, and are carrying guns more than I've seen on the streets here, certainly from the last visit, just to make sure that the gangs don't get any closer and try to take over territory. So who is in control in Port au Prince in the capital? Yeah. Right now, it does feel like there are almost factions within the city, if you will. I mean, it feels like there are aspects that have contained themselves and basically protected their own communities, if you will, not only physically and in putting up the defense, but also just kind of operating on their own neighbors, looking out for neighbors, if you will. And outside of that, there are, you know, some aspects that are able to continue just with some of the, you know, the state of government and police protection. But then, you know, you can hear it on and off at times. You'll have moments where gunfire will just erupt. And it shows you that, you know, these are times that are just totally unpredictable. And so for that reason, you've got people who are sealing themselves in their homes and who haven't left in the past couple of weeks. How difficult was it to get into the country? Yeah, I mean, this was a huge challenge and the logistics of six days waiting out in the Dominican Republic, you know, trying to go through a lot of bureaucratic red tape at times, of course. But that just shows you what the Dominican Republic and Haiti officials were trying to navigate to so as to get the foreign media. And now we happen to be the first ones to get into Port au Prince, which is significant, especially after six days of trying over land crossings, then trying to book certain helicopters to make our way in. And we finally were able to land about 3 hours ago. And this is just a sampling of our trip who are going to be applying to Haiti is going to take one hour to get there. The logistics of this trip alone have been incredibly challenging, to say the least. They're confirming with us something that we've been working on the entire day, and that is the landing zone, trying to figure out where well touched down amidst a very dire situation in Port au Prince. Gunshots, do you hear that? It is already hearing gunshots. Just a few seconds into stepping out of the car after arriving here, Port au Prince. And so that shows you the logistics of trying to get here. And again, six days to make that one helicopter ride. And as soon as it lands, a lot of the folks who are expats trying to get out are, of course, looking to board some of these helicopters and make their way back to the Dominican Republic. But those are the fortunate few, Anderson. Of course, you've got many Haitians here who they don't have that option to leave. And as far as a foreign presence in international aid, I mean, the UN is trying to set up an air bridge, but right now it doesn't seem like that's in effect. And so you've got a city that's essentially cut off from anything that would allow it to stay alive at this point, including food. 90% of the food that comes into this country is is imported. So, you know that that tells you just how significant any sort of supply chain that's cut off. If you think about it, the vast majority of what's consumed here has to come in from elsewhere. Supply lines are just totally blocked. It's making it near a extremely dire situation.",
    "There's breaking news in the 2024 presidential race. Former Vice President Mike Pence declaring tonight that he cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump. CNN's Christine Holmes is following the story for us. Christine, what is Pence saying about his decision? Well, Wolf, it was surprising and unsurprising at the same time, the two men served side by side, essentially. Donald Trump was the boss of Mike Pence, and Mike Pence was one of the most loyal soldiers to the former president up until January six, when he bucked a pressure campaign mounted by the former president and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. Today, no real mention of January six and saying he would not endorse former President Donald Trump. But this is what he had to say. Donald Trump is pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years, and that's why I cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump in this campaign. Now, the former vice president there is pinning it to these conservative values. We know that he also has launched this $20 million effort to secure conservative values. He's really trying to path chart a path for himself as this Reagan conservative within the Republican Party that really has started to come completely under former President Donald Trump. But while he doesn't mention Trump but his behavior right away or at all, you have to remember what happened when that Pence entered the race, which was essentially Donald Trump went after him. He called him weak. He said he didn't have the courage to overturn the election, do what needed to be done on January six and Pence has stood up to Donald Trump on that, essentially saying that Trump is wrong about what Pence's power was on January six, what his power was in terms of certifying the election. It's not that surprising, again, that this is where he ended up, but it is surprising that he unequivocally said in an interview that he is not endorsing him. He could have just ignored the question. He could have said, oh, I'm going to answer that at another time. Instead, he made a decision to say, in fact, I am not supporting my former boss. I am not supporting former President Donald Trump. Very significant moment indeed. Christine Romans reporting for us. Thank you very much. I want to bring back CNN political commentators S.E. Cupp and Maria Cardona. S.E., this is a remarkable shift from Mike Pence, at least by perception. What do you make of him saying he can't endorse his former running mate? Well, it is remarkable. This is a vice president saying he's not going to endorse the guy he served for four years and serve very loyal loyally. That is remarkable. However, pinning the reason on policy disagreements feels a bit like a cop out to say he's now at odds with the conservative agenda. Trump has always been at odds with the conservative agenda, whether that was the debt and the deficit, limited government, family values, protectionism. Mike Pence seemed to be fine with all of that. And in fact, Donald Trump exploded the debt and the deficit with Mike Pence's help. It's just crazy to me that Mike Pence can't say after all of this time, now that he's made it official, he's not endorsing him. It's because Donald Trump is dangerous. It's because he led an insurrection. It's because he's corrupt. It's because he's facing criminal indictments. It's because he's anti America and anti-democratic. He can't say all the very obvious things he has to say. They now have policy disagreements. It's just so mealy mouthed and a pretty, I think, impotent way to end what was once a pretty promising political career for Mike Pence. Interesting, Maria, As all of us remember, Pence was a very loyal vice president to Donald Trump during his presidency. How surprised are you by this? Well, I am surprised because I thought his cowardice would continue since it has been a reality up until now. So why now, I suppose? And frankly, I would have had a lot more respect for him had he said I cannot in good conscience endorse someone who called for his MAGA supporters to murder me, because that's exactly what Donald Trump did. And so moving forward, you know, look, it does give Democrats a talking point by saying Donald Trump's own vice president did not endorse him, does not believe he is up for the job. And so that's one thing that it gives us. But at the end of the day, I really don't think it matters because let's remember, Mike Pence doesn't even really have his own base because he never was really able to stand up for what he believes. SC Do you think this decision by Pence could potentially impact independent voters out there, or maybe even Republicans who are skeptical of Trump? But honestly, I mean, as Maria just indicated, Pence has no constituency. He's really irrelevant in the Republican Party. And listen, I mean, a bunch of us are, but he's he's made himself irrelevant because in carrying Trump's water, he turned off principled conservatives like me. But in not carrying it all the way across the finish line on January six, he become became traitorous to the rest of the MAGA Republican Party. So I'm not sure his opinion matters all that much. And for independents and moderates, they're certainly not taking their lead from Mike Pence's, you know, you know, political compass, because we've we've not really seen it point do north this entire time. It's interesting, Maria. Mike Pence referenced January 6th during that Fox interview. We all remember him having to be evacuated from the Capitol as the rioters were storming the building and chanted for him to be hanged. Do you think Pence would be declining to endorse Trump if not for the events of that day? You know, that's a really good question, Wolf. I would like to say, again, giving him the benefit of a whole lot of doubt here that maybe he does believe that Donald Trump has turned around on conservative principles. But to his point, he did that for four years with Mike Pence, his help as vice president. And so that's why I said earlier that I think I would have more respect for him had he made that issue, had he made January six, the fact that Donald Trump is dangerous, that he tried to steal an American election, that he inspire the MAGA folks to come and attack the Capitol, murdering policemen, calling for murdering the VP if he had led with those those reasons, Wolf, I would have had a lot more respect for him. And maybe we could say, well, that was the reason that was the red line in the sand for Mike Pence. But then again, why did it take so fricking long? Maria Cardona and S.E. Cupp to both of you, thank you very, very much.",
    "Donald Trump is back on the campaign trail this weekend after officially clinching the Republican nomination, just days after hosting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at Mar a Lago. Trump heaped praise on the autocrat whose crackdown on the press in his country restricted LGBTQ rights and opposes NATO's support for Ukraine. It's not the first time Trump has praised Orban or other dictators around the world. There's nobody that's better, smarter or a better than Viktor Orban. President Xi is a brilliant man. Putin Very smart. Kim Jong UN, who had a good relationship with is a tough, smart guy, which got us to wondering what's with Trump's affection for a strong man? He's watched Godfather two many times. I don't know. He's just a bully. And so he likes bullies and he's not as good as it as they are. So he's caused and he's cosplaying bullying. He likes that dictator. He has ambitions himself. Or do you think he just is impressed by what they get away with? He has ambitions himself, but he'll never be able to do it because he's he's not them. We'll see. Maybe he will. Maybe he will. I don't know. Reihan, how do you explain Trump's praise for dictators and apparent pride in getting along with them? I honestly think that Donald Trump thinks of himself as a dealmaker, and he loves people who are willing to kiss the ring and willing to praise him and people who are adversarial. He goes cold fast. So it's not just dictators. Shinzo Abe, back when he was prime minister of Japan, made a big show of currying favor with Donald Trump. He loved Shinzo Abe. Zelensky You know, Vladimir Zelensky of Ukraine is someone who actually Donald Trump does not in fact, say negative things about because he thinks of Zelensky as someone who did not work hand in hand with the Democrats of a deal. Why do you think he's not bothered by the fact that they run autocracy? Because he is someone who is really self-focused. If he thinks that he's got a deal. Yeah. There you go. And if he thinks he can cut a deal with someone, he can woo them with his words, which is what he was always doing as a dealmaker, as a real estate mogul. That's his mental model. That's like code for narcissism. I'm just. I just. But Trump does fancy himself a strong man in certain ways. And the difference between Trump and G and Putin is, one, the self-discipline factor. But two, that our system of government won't allow it. And I do think we have to look at the difference between words and actions here, where Joe Biden has taken very maximalist rhetoric toward some of the toward some of these countries. Trump may have kissed up to some of these dictators rhetorically, but if you take Russia as an example, his policies actually were quite hardline. Well, I want to I want to pick up on that, because Trump says that getting along with Putin was a good thing and notes that Putin didn't invade Ukraine on his watch. Take a look. We are a nation that allowed Russia to devastate a country, Ukraine killing hundreds of thousands of people, and it will only get worse. It would never have happened with me as your commander in chief. And for four long years, it didn't. Lulu did Trump's Putin strategy, Whether you like it or not, did it work? I would say it is very difficult to know what was in Putin's mind about when he took the action that he did. But there is another argument that says that because Trump weakened Naito, it was actually right picking for Putin to act, to push into Ukraine, because you had, in his view, a weakened naito, you had a new president and possibly the best chance that he would have had to push in and take over the country they always wanted. But the fact is, Trump points out quite correctly, that Putin moved into Ukraine under Obama. Putin moved into Ukraine under Biden. Putin didn't move into Ukraine right under Trump. So does Trump have a point? Russia has perpetrated two major acts of aggression in the past decade. Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 and Russia invaded Ukraine two years ago. Those happened under Obama and under Joe Biden. Under Trump, he may think that he got along with Putin and said nice things. In reality, he pulled out of the Iron F treaty. He provided lethal aid to the Ukrainians and those were on the ground deterrence that his predecessor and his successor did not do. So the key thing is to make sure that, you know, you can have conciliatory rhetoric, but it has to be a kind of iron fist with a velvet glove. You have to have that other part where you have folks around you who are willing to be hawkish, willing to be tough. Trump had that in his first term. The question is, if he wins a second term, will that also be true? Because a lot of those foreign policy cases, Putin's will not be around. They come on, he looks like a puppet to Putin. And Putin loves having Donald Trump in office. But it's absolutely the case. The Trump administration ramped up the pressure on Putin during his that may be, but he was waiting for his chance to come in. And that has to happen to be when you have a feckless Joe Biden in office. I don't think that's a coincidence. I just want to move to one other point here, and that is Trump's talk speaking about his affection for strongmen, his talk about being a dictator on day one, weaponizing just one, Justice Department suspending the Constitution. Lulu. Seriously, do you think Trump's talk about dictators is just talk? I don't think it's just talk. And the reason I know that it isn't just talk is because you see actually an entire apparatus around Donald Trump, especially for his second term, that that that lifts up people like Viktor Orban, that talks about Christian nationalism in terms that are honorific and saying that this is a model for America that they need to emulate. And that is, I think, deeply problematic. I don't know that the guardrails of democracy in this country are actually for that. Or do you see some movements towards authoritarianism in a second Trump term? Again, our system won't allow it. Trump If it were up to him, he'd still be in office. He wouldn't have let Biden take office on January 1st, but our system wouldn't allow it. There are a lot of things Trump would like to do. He says a lot of stupid things. Fortunately, thank God. And thanks to the founders, we have a system of government that will not allow him to do all of the things that he would like to do.",
    "As we have been expecting all afternoon since Judge Scott McAfee issued his ruling regarding district Attorney finding Willis and her ability to stay on the case, prosecuting Donald Trump and his co-defendants for trying to overturn the 2020 election. We've just learned that Nathan Wade, the lead prosecutor in that case, has stepped down after this scathing ruling by Judge McAfee. And we've obtained a copy of the letter that Wade wrote to District Attorney Fani Willis, sending his resignation the very first sentence, quote, The furtherance of the rule of law and democracy is and has always been the North star of our combined efforts in this prosecution. Clearly here, Wade taking the step of resigning, in part because he had no other choice. We have a team of reporters and analysts looking at this story now. We want to go to CNN's Nick Valencia is live for us in Fulton County. Nick, the letter here essentially outlining that he's proud of the work that he's done for finding Willis, but that it's clear, according to Judge McAfee, that he needs to step away. Well, Boris, it's official. Nathan Wade is out as the special prosecutor in the criminal case involving the former president and some of his closest allies. I'm looking here at that resignation letter from the Wade Campbell law firm addressed to the Honorable Fani Willis. You read part of that. And I'm going to read a little bit more here. It says, Although the court found that the defendants failed to meet their burden of proving that the DA acquired an actual conflict of interest, I'm offering my resignation in the interest of democracy and dedication to the American public and to move this case forward as quickly as possible. It is a very short resignation letter, but it does add at the end of it that he wishes the funding of the district attorney's office success and safety through this process. It's something, as you mentioned, that we had been anticipating for, you know, all day really since we got this ruling. But now, Boris, it is official. That's right. And let's just be clear about what this order had said right after the evidentiary hearing. We heard from the the judge writing in a couple dozen pages here. The court therefore, concludes that the prosecution of this case cannot proceed until the state selects one of two options. One seemed very clear it wasn't going to happen. The district attorney may choose to step aside, along with the whole of her office, and refer the prosecution to the prosecuting attorney's counsel for reassignment, or alternatively, Sadie Wade can withdraw. Let's bring in Paula Reid to talk a little bit more about this. We were expecting this. It was really a matter of when. It was a matter of when. And this is a pretty classy letter, right? He tries to bring it back to the idea that the most important thing here is the rule of law and democracy reminds people that the nature of this case are allegations that people tried to undermine the outcome of the 2020 election. These are grave allegations and in a pretty tactful way. He also points out the fact that the judge did not find an actual conflict here. They did not find actual corruption or that funny. Finding Willis or Nathan Wade engaged in some sort of scheme to financially benefit off of this investigation. He says, quote, The defendants failed to meet their burden of proving that the district attorney acquired an actual conflict of interest. So this is a pretty well done letter given all of the circumstances. It brings it back to the facts and the law, because at the heart of this is a criminal case that is mostly intact. They just had six counts dismissed, but we knew this had to happen. And this is a pretty classy way to go given everything that's happened over the past few months. And to your point, he redirects the attention away from the question of conflict of interest, which has been settled away from the controversy surrounding the romantic relationship and focuses on the question of Donald Trump and his allies allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election. He says that he's offering his resignation in the interest of democracy and dedication to the American people. We want to go to Norm Eisen, who is standing by. Norm, your reaction to the news that this is now officials that Nathan Wade has stepped aside in the Fulton County prosecution because he's doing the right thing here. This relationship was never smart. We've discussed from the start that likely was not a legal or evidentiary basis for disqualification, but that Wade had to go. That's been clear for many weeks now. He's done it. I do think it speaks to his commitment. There have been so many false things said about him that he was not a highly qualified lawyer coming to this case. That's been proven false, that he didn't do a good job on the case. That's not true either. He defeated with the team. He led some of the best litigators in the country in a series of pretrial skirmishes. He got four guilty pleas. But once this controversy emerged, he had to go. It's the right thing to do. It's a strong and good order by the judge. I'm glad to see Wade and the DA's office acting fast so we can return to getting this trial scheduled, which is what a majority of the American people would like to see happen. Norm, stay with us as we head back to Atlanta and Nick Valencia, where you, Nick, are tracking a new development. What can you share with us? Well, look, Wade was an instrumental part of this case. He was with Bonnie Willis for 865 days to be exact, and part of the team that secured 19 indictments, including against the former president and also for guilty pleas. And now we have our hands on the response from Finally Willis to Nathan Wade's resignation letter, and she highlights some of those accomplishments by her leader, former lead prosecutor. I want to read part of this letter here now. It says, quote, I will always remember and will remind everyone that you were brave enough to step forward and take on the investigation and prosecution of the allegations that the defendants in this case engage in a conspiracy to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election. Funny, Willis goes on to say, others who were considered were understandably concerned for the safety of themselves and their families that would arise from their acceptance of your role. You were the one who had the courage to accept the role, even though you did not seek it. Just very quickly, I think this other paragraph that follows up is also important. She says, You are an outstanding advocate in the 865 days you served on this case, you completed a thorough investigation that required the use of a special purpose grand jury to compel the testimony of witnesses inside and outside of Georgia, including litigating in eight states, the District of Columbia and the United States Supreme Court to obtain critical testimony. So a very complimentary letter back by Phonte Willis to this breaking news that we have here that Nathan Wade, as we expected, is out as a lead prosecutor in this case. Brianna. A glowing review of Nathan Wade's work on the case. Nick, please stand by. We also have Jen Rogers standing by. And Jen, Norm alluded to the idea of how this case now moves forward. So Nathan Wade is tendered, his resignation. What do you think comes next? Well, next, they'll continue with the process of trying to get a trial date set and moving towards that trial date. You know, they've been engulfed in this controversy for weeks now, and that's kind of put everything else on the back burner. But finding Willis and her team, we're looking for initially an August trial date. I don't think there's any way that's going to happen, but they're now going to shift their attention to trying to get Judge McAfee back in the mode of scheduling them a trial date so that they can move towards a date certain. And of course, to the extent that Nathan Wade was going to be involved in those preparations for trial, they'll have to replace him in order to move forward. In that vein, once they get a trial date. Yeah, and she has certainly been admonished in this legal win for her. To be clear, she will remain on this case. But some blistering comments from the judge. Do you think that's going to change in how she proceeds here, maybe in style or tone? Well, I do hope that she takes to heart some of what the judge said. You know, he criticized her for the unprofessional nature of her testimony. He said that her judgment was poor in this whole thing. So, you know, I do hope that she takes those words to heart. There also was some sharp criticism of the church that she gave in this case, including playing the race card, suggesting the defendants were playing the race card. So I do hope she carefully reads and absorbs the words of Judge McAfee, who seems to me to have been very reasonable in this ruling, and that she does have that governance going forward. I mean, this particular controversy is behind her. But the judge even suggested that defendants should fight. Looks like we have a technical issue, but I will finish the thought for her with Paula Reed. It seems like Judge McAfee set the table for a potential gag order against District Attorney Willis. Yeah, and that's pretty shocking because usually prosecutors don't make statements about cases that they're working on. You know, they're not sparring with defense counsel on the witness stand. I mean, the idea that you would have a prosecutor under a gag order, that's pretty extraordinary. But it also speaks to how the judge views her conduct in his opinion, he called it, quote, unprofessional. And look, these are pretty classy letters, responses. Trying to bring it back to the facts of the case. But another fact is that these two prosecutors chose to have a romantic relationship while they were overseeing the most high profile state level criminal investigation in the land. As the judge said, this was bad judgment. And in an effort to suss out whether this was an actual conflict or an appearance of conflict. The judge even called into question their credibility. This is such a forced error that now casts, as the judge described, a cloud over this case. So the way they've handled today, the judge's order has been has been really impressive with their conduct over the past year or so, has really put this case not in the greatest of places and still an open question as to whether they even go before the election, because all of this prompted a delay.",
    "The judge hinted a gag order may actually be necessary for Fanny Willis. Tell us why and what would that and how would that happen? Yeah, that's a really remarkable part of the ruling. It's sort of towards the end and it's the B storyline, but it's important here. Now, this refers to the church speech that I think Paula referenced earlier a few days after the defendants made this motion to disqualify Fanny Willis. She went in public in a church with cameras rolling and essentially said that the reason that this motion had been brought was racism. And the judge says in his ruling that that was a legally inappropriate statement for the DA to make. He's absolutely right. A prosecutor cannot make inflammatory public statements about the defendants. They're the ones who have their rights at issue. And the judge basically said it may be necessary to put a gag order on the D.A. and that tells you something. I mean, look, Fanny Willis has made, in my view and in the judge's you improper public statements throughout this case. She's given dozens of public interviews She's given her opinion on Donald Trump's guilt before the grand jury even voted on this, which is improper. And so it's pretty rare. I don't think I've ever seen it before where a judge has said we may need to slap a gag order on the prosecutor. Prosecutors are supposed to operate under gag orders anyway. Prosecutors like to say we do our talking in court here. Finally, Willis has violated that principle and the judge has taken note of it. The judge did call comments that Willis made in January at an Atlanta area church about the case legally improper. He said a gag order isn't the question before the court, but I wonder if you thought he was basically saying he might be inclined to grant one if he's asked to do so based on public comments she's made about the case What's really important to understand about that dynamic of the opinion is that we don't want DA's to ever not even remotely discuss the facts innocence or the, you know, the allegations of wrongdoing in a substantive way in the public eye. And so we don't want to taint the jury pool what Fanny was did in her church speech was speaking very broad generalities. And that happens a lot because DA's in Georgia, and as is the case in many states, are partizan la elected officials. So they will make campaign speeches, they will make appearances in the public and talk about their philosophies generally. But what she did here for Judge MacPhee was a step too far in impugning the character of the defense attorneys and perhaps coloring the view that people in Fulton County, the jury pool here, would have of a case that that's been brought against Donald Trump and his allies in an improper way. So I think she's she's been warned pretty significantly by Judge McCarthy to not step out of bounds and to really only speak through legal filings in terms of effecting a jury pool. He seemed to say or he said in this filing that there's enough time between now when this has been this decision has come out and when jury selection selection will begin, that it's not going to affect that He says it shouldn't get in the way. But what if potential jury members have heard about this, about this evidentiary hearing Do you think that could be a factor in jury selection? They may be asked about the voir dire process, which is the process by which we screen potential jurors through was going to be complicated no matter what, in large part because this case is so salient and so politically polarizing, it'll be very hard to find a panel of jurors who don't have some kind of, you know, pre or gained notion of what this case is about and who can adjudge the evidence fairly and impartially. That was always going to be an issue. But I think time is to the the the DA's benefit here and to everybody. The entire judicial systems benefit here because people have a fairly short memory. And that's especially true in a year like 20, 24, where there will be so many political issues, so many trials that Donald Trump has in other places, that this might be just a blip in people's memories. In the long term. By the time we get to a trial which may be very late 20, 24 or even early 20, 25 at this rate that's your expectation she's pushing for August but that's what you expect on timing There's a lot more that we have to go through, I think, before we can talk about an August trial. Two things are true. There are other important pretrial motions that are still under consideration by Judge McCarthy. One of them being one about prosecutor, about presidential immunity and the supremacy clause, which is related to a case that the Supreme Court will hear next month. So he may want to hear what the Supreme Court has to say about that before he weighs in. And that might take some time. And there are other sundry issues that have to be addressed. And the other important key dynamic here is Donald Trump can't be in multiple places at once. So if there are other criminal trials that are happening in the summer or early fall, then Fort County will have to wait their turn. It's not implausible that we'll have a late summer trial, perhaps. But I think at this point, it's impractical. All right. Professor very interesting, especially there on the timing. We appreciate it. Professor Anthony, Michael, Chris, thank you. Let's discuss the case now with national security attorney Bradley Moss. Bradley, thank you so much. For being with us. So Judge McAfee here saying that there is no effective conflict of interest, that the relationship between Fannie Willis and Nathan Wade was not relevant to the charges against Donald Trump and his co-defendants. But he does say that there was an appearance of impropriety that must be remove What's your main takeaway from that ruling? Yeah, you know, Judge Mukasey here was pretty evenhanded ruling. He basically decided, I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here. There was a bunch of smoke there, certainly a stain on the reputation now of Nathan Wade and Fannie Wells and of this prosecution. From an optics standpoint, but for as a purpose of as a matter of law in terms of the evidentiary standard that these defense lawyers had to meet, they simply didn't have the proof that there was an actual conflict of interest, that there was an actual financial material benefit tied to Fannie Willis in prosecuting this case that would mandate disqualification. But he he agreed with the idea that because there is this stain on the case, that because there's the appearance of impropriety, someone has to go. And that's almost certainly going to be Nathan Wade. The case will continue on. And the question becomes if this gets to trial, will the voters even remember what happened leading up to it, if it makes it to trial and we have a verdict before Election Day? You said it'll almost certainly be that funny, Will. It stays and hires a new lead prosecutor. How does that process complicate the case? It doesn't seem like this August timeline that we were trending toward is tenable. Sure. So the idea is that she's most likely going to just use relying on her existing team. She's indicated they're ready to go within 30 days. There's no way that's going to happen. At this point, given the various changes in the schedule since that time, especially with the chaos we're seeing out in Manhattan right now with the district attorney. The case in the Stormy Daniels matter. But it's more than likely that what funny Wolf will try to do is use the existing team that was already there, aside from Nathan Wade. They can pick up the slack from that. He would have otherwise handled and they can still aim for an early fall trial. How we're going to figure out this trial schedule for a presidential candidate, given that almost all three of the other cases are certainly going to start no earlier than June or July is something that no one really knows yet. The judges have got to be just gnashing their teeth over right now. Yeah, it is quite possible she doesn't hire anyone else and just sticks with the team that's in place. I do want to ask you about the potential for a gag order because it's something that Judge Mukasey alluded to. He described comments that were made by Willis at an Atlanta area church in January as legally improper I want to listen to some of those remarks now. I hired one white man, brilliant my friend and a great lawyer in Ohio and one black man another superstar, a great friend and a great lawyer. First thing they say, oh, she can play the race card now, in defending Nathan Wade there, the defense argued that Willis was tainting a jury pool. McAfee saying that it's probably too soon, we're too far out from jury selection for that to be the case. But he did say that the time may have arrived for an order preventing Willis from further discussing the case in public. Do you think that is essentially winking at the defense, saying that they should file a motion to impose a gag order on Willis I think it's certainly was suggesting that they should consider it doesn't mean hell necessarily. Granted, we'd have to see what the scope of any gag order would be. But if I'm sorry, Willis, I want to retreat from the limelight of this case right now in the sense that let your line prosecutors let the team you assembled be the face of this case. You're the political face, understandably. You were elected. You're going to always be the face in some manner. But let your team handle the case, prosecute it, bring it to trial. And get a conviction. You want to be in the background as much as possible so that when people think about this case going forward, when they see it possibly going to trial in the lead up to Election Day, they're thinking about the evidence in the case and they're thinking about the allegations against Donald Trump. They're not simply about finding Willis. Bradley Moss, appreciate the analysis. Thanks for joining us.",
    "Former President Trump's legal calendar is not happening in a vacuum. It is happening in the middle of a razor thin presidential campaign. With me to talk about that, CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Laura Coates and Gloria Borger. Hi. Hi again. Jeff, I want you to talk about something that I heard you talking about this morning. I'll give a little peek behind the curtain to us sort of internally, which I thought was such interesting reporting about the way that the Biden campaign is viewing everything that's happening with Trump on the legal front. Look, I mean, not that long ago, there was kind of an assumption that that the former president either might have some type of a judgment by the time voting judgment day comes in November. That is very much an open question. Now. I would say the betting odds are that there may be no a conclusion to any of these cases. But as far as thinking inside the Biden sort of broader world is they are not planning on a conviction. They are not sort of focusing on that. It's out of their control and they have enough challenges to worry about on their own, trying to get people to sort of embrace Joe Biden as opposed to rejecting Donald Trump. But they are no longer thinking that any of these cases in Georgia or here might be resolved. The Georgia case, though, is so interesting because I was talking to an adviser who really is kind of talking this out. Not sure how it plays because it's a local story. And Georgia is a battleground state. We saw last Saturday Joe Biden and Donald Trump were campaigning hours apart, miles apart. We don't know how this plays. This gets so much local coverage in Georgia. It could sort of rally support for Donald Trump or not. But that is one wild card here that was sort of not on anyone's bingo card four years ago when Georgia became a surprisingly Democratic win for Biden. They weren't necessarily expecting that either. But it's not a must win for Biden. But boy, they sure would like it so equal. It's easy for you to it's harder for him to get to 70 without George. Yeah. And it's so interesting the reason why this is a story, because Trump really needed Georgia. Right. Right. Is potentially playing the hall of mirrors. It's a hall of mirrors. Right. It also it just sort of undermines the whole legal system. And, you know, Donald that's what Donald Trump has been trying to do. And his his whole spiel is the legal system is rigged. It's rigged against me. And look at what happened in Georgia with Fannie Willis. And so you can't trust the legal system because she's still going to be prosecuting my case. And she shouldn't be. She doesn't deserve to be there. So in the state of Georgia, as you point out, even though it's a big local story, she's an elected official. The judge is elected it's going to have some legs in this state. I mean, two points, really. On the one hand, Georgia is unique because these were Republicans who fought back against Donald Trump. Brad Raffensperger, Brian Kemp. Right. This was the state with Laura, their RINOs. That's right there. I keep forgetting once they've gone against, they can no longer be a part of the party. That was sarcasm. You know, it wasn't clear historically at that, but that was what makes it unique about about Georgia and also on Tuesday. I mean, even Nikki Haley is no longer in the race She was holding her own against Donald Trump in Fulton County, in DeKalb County, in the Georgia suburbs. Well. Maybe a little bit telling. But finally, remember, Donald Trump's goal is delay, but his real goal was to it's all to go away. That is not happened in Mar-A-Lago. The judge did not dismiss the case, even although he wanted to talk about the issues of an ambiguous, he says, Espionage Act. He wants the funny worst case to go away if she had been disqualified. There was no chance this case is going to go to trial this year. Let alone maybe even at all. And so delay is one thing, but he doesn't want to kick the can down the road. He wants the road to be obliterated. Now, he doesn't want to just delay. He wants to destroy yes. And destroy means destroy people's faith in institutions. And one of those, of course, is a judicial system. Well, that's that's all true. But the other major factor here, he definitely wants to. What did you say? Don't kick the can down the road. Yeah, burn the road. He wants to destroy the rest of the reiterate the road. It was such a good quote that he got some bad later moments. But but, Jeff, a big part of if you kind of go back in time and him announcing at the time that he did in 20, 22 and the way that he has approached his political campaign and his legal campaign simultaneously is all about him personally. I mean, I'm not saying he doesn't want to be president, but a big part of why he wanted to be president and wanted to declare his candidacy early on was to blur the lines. Right. And to make it harder for him personally to be successfully prosecuted because, oh, I'm not just a former president. I am a candidate for president in the future, without a doubt. I mean, this is someone who adds, you know, complete name I.D. He could have jumped in at the last moment the night before the Iowa caucuses. And he could have still won. But the reality is he jumped in first. He wanted to be a candidate for president so he could say that this was all part of the witch hunt, all part of election fraud, trying to block him from this. Such a good point or that you made that Republicans in Georgia stood up to him? It's a little unclear some of those same Republicans will put their jerseys on and vote for Donald Trump in November, but some may not. I mean, so this is why it's such an interesting laboratory in Georgia. This case, if it goes to trial, will be on television every day. It's the only one that will that is different in this as well. And it's also one, should he become president that he cannot do anything about because it's a state case. So this is the first ruling, really a string of some pretty positive rulings for the former president from all courts. This is the first one that was not in his favor. And it's a big deal. He's been pretty lucky, though, so far. Gloria, I want you to weigh in on this. But you talk to voters all the time. You're out on the road constantly. How much are they tuned in to all things Trump legal? It's a blur. All these cases run together and blur together. The Georgia is an exception. I haven't been down to Georgia for a few weeks to talk to voters or I think that could be different because it's happening there but I was in Michigan and Wisconsin most recently, and voters are it just all runs together. What are the cases, whether or not if you don't like Trump, obviously your support of this, if you do, you think it's you know, he's being ganged up on and then you have as you come in, I want you to listen to Jamie Raskin. He was talking to Manu earlier this week. He, on the one hand said, look like when some of the charges were dropped in Georgia, like that's the way it is. And he's he's making the argument that if you're going to respect that judicial system, then you have to go all in on that. Let's listen for a walk in crime wave like Donald Trump. You can trample every criminal civil disciplinary, ethical boundary you want and then you know that it's going to take time for the justice system to catch up with you. But that's in the nature of justice system based on due process. But we we've got to stick by the rule of law. It's all we've got. Well, right. You do have to stick by the rule of law. And sometimes it's on your side and sometimes it isn't. And I think in these four cases, we might not hear any of them before the election. It is worked in Donald Trump's favor because he wants to delay and destroy and do whatever. And now, you know, in D.C., you're waiting for a Supreme Court ruling and there's nothing you can do to skip over that. You have to you have to wait. And our polls and other people's polls show that the American public does want to get a resolution on at least one of these cases before they vote. They want to know if he's going to be convicted of any of these things. And they now it looks like they may not know. By the way, being a Teflon Don is not that is not the best asset. You're talking about cases in multiple juries because you could have the cumulative effect of jurors being aggravated that this person keeps getting away with it. And they may say to themselves, well, not on my watch what his defense has to guard against that. And as somebody who has prosecuted cases, if you've had that experience.",
    "When I found out I had cancer and I had to go through chemo, I thought, Oh my God, I'm going to be lying in bed drinking food out of a straw. Unable to do anything. Unable to live my life. My normal life. Oh, thank you. This is also my country. There is nowhere to take cover here. All right. All right. Prime time. Here we go. Today is chemo number six of the 16 that I have to pick. It is poison going into your system. So you are being poisoned in order to try to heal you, which I find absolutely. Insane, but that is the way it is. Everybody gets different drugs and has different issues. But for me, the first couple of infusions, I was fine. In a way I could not have imagined. And I don't want to be sick. So far, I haven't been I mean, actually sent to my doctor Is this trick working? I felt like Superwoman by the fourth one. I felt pretty bad for a while. I still went to work, but there were a couple of times one in particular. I said, Can you guys bring the bucket over here? I might be sick. Just making sure you work We decided to try cold capping, which is something that you can you can do to try to save your hair. Let's take a deep breath. Normally 60 to 80% of your hair goes after your second infusion. And if you're lucky, into your third hour. I'm just kidding. So I was prepared for it. There's nothing I can do about it. And that doesn't look like a lot, probably, but it sure feels like it. There is a sick In my case, stage three 60 to 70% survival rate. I've got several more months of chemo. Once that finishes, there is a break so that your body sort of deals with the residuals of the chemo treatment. And then I will get a double mastectomy. I will get radiation. I mean, it feels like it's never going to end, but it's just one treatment at a time. I know cancer is not supposed to be funny, but what can you do? I got a laugh. Be kind to yourself from the time, really of puberty for me. I've disliked the way that my body is when I asked my body to take in poison on a regular basis and ask my body to survive. There was one day I was in the gym, I picked up my phone and I'm thinking, this body, this body that I have mentally tormented I apologized to it. I was really neglecting myself. And that makes me sad. That I was sort of taking advantage of this body and not giving it back what it needed. Okay. Does that piece out this is a real lesson about what real self-care is and real self-care to me is. I'm drinking my water. Drinking enough water is going for a run. Is being able to work out letting yourself be mad letting yourself cry. And why am I just learning this now at 50? I don't know. Because I'm trying to tell people that I'm visiting with you people. We say all these things like, make sure you live every day like it's your last work in nine to five. Most of us are just not capable of doing that. Now I actually do that to cure cancer. I'm ready for severe.",
    "Let's get over to Paula Reid, who has more information about what is in this decision from Scott Mac and from Judge Scott McAfee. Paula, what do you know? So the top line here is that the judge has ruled that the district attorney, Fani Willis, can continue on this case against former President Trump and over a dozen other defendants. But he does address this issue of an appearance of a conflict, because the big question here is whether there was an actual conflict. The defendants were alleging that Fani Willis, you know, not only that, she had this romantic relationship with the lead prosecutor on the Trump case, but that she also benefited financially. And he had to decide the judge had to had to sort of do this analysis. Is it enough that this just looks bad, that there's an appearance of a conflict? Or did they need to prove to the defendants that Trump and his co-defendants need to prove that there was an actual conflict Now, again, I say that D, if only Willis can stay on this case. And also, Piers, that the judge is saying that this appearance issue needs to be addressed before this can go forward. So this appears to be a pretty nuanced ruling, but the headline is that the district attorney and her office can stay on this case. But we continue to read, to learn more about exactly what the judge is saying about how you need to address the appearance of impropriety. All right, Paula, read with the headline there. And it is a big one, which is that District Attorney Fani Willis can stay on the case. She is not disqualified. Holding her office is not disqualified. The Fulton County District Attorney Office continue to prosecute these crimes. Yeah, that is the bottom line. Biggest takeaway here. Willis can remain on the case. It sounds like the judge has found there was not an actual conflict of interest, not a provable financial conflict of interest. Important to keep in mind, the defendants, Donald Trump and the other charged defendants, they're the ones who bore the burden of proof here. They had to prove there was a financial conflict of interest. And apparently, based on our initial readings of this ruling, they have not carried that burden. Now, we'll see if the judge has some other sort of measures that he suggests. We'll see if he has any harsh words for Fanny Willis or her office. But yes, the bottom line is the D.A. stays on the case, hence her office stays on the case. Hence, it can continue to move forward. And as we said before, they don't have a set trial date yet. The D.A. has asked for a trial in August. I don't think that's remotely realistic, but it will continue. It will not be put into this sort of suspended animation that otherwise would have gone into. Stay with us. Right now, we're going to go to Paula Reed. She's got some more information. You're going through this right now and looking through the judge's ruling. And there are some harsh words in it. We understand There are two allies point the judge. While he has not removed finally Willis from the case, he does have some considerable criticism for her. You saying, look, without sufficient evidence that the district attorney acquired a personal stake in this prosecution or that her financial arrangements had any impact on the case. So there he's addressing the fact that they didn't really prove that she benefited from Wade being on this case when she was in a romantic relationship. She said the defendant's claims of an actual conflict must be denied. Like, look, you didn't prove that she had any sort of benefit that she received from the money Nathan Wade is making from this case. But he said this finding is by no means any indication that the court condones this tremendous lapse in judgment or the unprofessional manner of the district attorney's testimony during the evidentiary hearing. Rather, it is the undersigned, the judge's opinion that Georgia law does not permit the finding of an actual conflict for simply making bad choices. So this is pretty significant. I mean, he is suggesting that she or he is saying that he she had a tremendous lapse in judgment, that she was unprofessional when she testified. Remember, she was getting pretty contentious, pretty fiery with the defense attorney insisting that she was not on trial when, in fact, they were asking her questions because the judge was assessing whether she needed to be disqualified. And then also saying here that she made bad choices. And look,\neven though she is going to stay on the case, all of this, especially this language from the judge, and we're just giving the opinion right now, I'm sure there's there's likely more. It's really a gift to former President Trump and his co-defendants because they're not only going to fight this case on the merits, they fight it in the court of public opinion. Optics here matter. He is trying to undermine trust in the justice system. And if you have a judge who is overseeing a case calling the prosecutor, again, unprofessional, saying that she made a bad decision, she had a lapse in judgment. That is a lot of ammunition for the former president and his co-defendants. Well, thank you so much. Paul is going to continue to bring us the headlines. Paula, stick close and just let us know. We also have Michael Moore, former U.S. attorney, joining us as well. Michael, your take on what the nuance as Paula has laid out. The headline. Bonnie Willis not disqualified from the case, not dismissed from the case. Her office is still handling this case, but the words and the criticisms coming from the judge about her unprofessional manner, as he says it Yeah.\nWell, I'm glad to be with you. This was a self-inflicted wound that should have been healed and taken care of months ago. But basically, they've just let it get infected. Now to this place where the district attorney has been called by a court that she has to practice in front of her office, practice in front of Gates. She's been called no unprofessional. And this, frankly, it is a gift to the defense, I believe, as they will use this as they talk about whether or not the case has merit or whether or not it was brought for other reasons, whether or not as a professional prosecutor, and all that, we're going to hear all that down the road. But we're also going to hear expert comments from the Georgia legislature as they have moved forward with their panel inquiry into her conduct We're going to hear now this finding echoed around the halls of Congress by the likes of, you know, people like Jim Jordan and things like this. So, you know, this is not a good day for the state and it's not a good look for the state. But remember, this could have been remedied as we go through the old or now this initial and this have been nipped in the bud. And I don't know why it was left to fester, but now, you know, it's basically caused gangrene of the limb and that the judge said, look, we're we're moving it if we're going forward. And that's and that's that's where we're at today. Well, not so much. Right. I mean, she's allowed to continue prosecuting the case. The case is still in the DA's office. So there is an element of I understand that politically, it is now loaded with a lot of comments from a judge here. But the case the alternative, Michael, was that this judge could have said this case no longer can be prosecuted by the Fulton County's D.A. and that would have put it into a complete limbo where no one may have been prosecuting it for months and months and months now. But this this is the same judge now that's going to oversee this case. And this is not this is not what you will go into a judge, if you're a prosecutor, a lawyer on the side of a case where you've already been called unprofessional. And so while and I don't think politically she's got to worry. I mean, she's in a Democratic county. She's she's liked by many people in her personal and professional capacity. I don't think she's got to worry about whether or not somebody runs against her and uses this as some big trumpet that they're going to, you know, beat her at the polls. This is about how the case looks going forward. And now whether or not when a representation is made by the state at court, whether or not the judge believes that. And so this is paints the entire picture. The case may go forward. I mean, the case is going to go forward anyway. The prosecuting attorney wanted somebody. But this\ncase, I will tell you, I don't believe is going forward before the election in that matter of finding witnesses prosecute that, you know, or the prosecutor that's appointed from wherever this case is not going to move forward in a way. And I think the judge is saying you've got to clean up your house before you. You know, if we're going to deal with the deal with this case, so it's not it is not a good thing. It is no law. You wants to be in front of a judge arguing motions, asking for things to not. Michael, hang on. We're going to jump in here. Michael. Michael, we're just going to jump in because we got to get back to Paula. Just got some more information from the actual ruling. Paula. Yeah. Look, I do agree with with Michael's point there about the timing on when this case can go forward. Finally, Willis originally said she wanted to bring it in August. This process to attempt to disqualify her is certainly not even up some time But now there's another issue she needs to address, and that is the fate of the lead prosecutor for this investigation. Nathan, wait. Who? She had a romantic relationship with the judge here just like he had some harsh words for Fanny Willis also has some pretty strong language related to Mr. Wade. Here he calls Wade's testimony his explanation for some incorrect information that he submitted, quote, unpersuasive. He also describes his conduct as showing a willingness to wrongfully conceal his relationship with the district attorney. The judge said as the case moves forward, reasonable members of the public could easily be left to wonder whether the financial exchanges between Wade and the district attorney have continued, resulting in some form of benefit to the district attorney or whether the romantic relationship has resumed. I think you read between the lines. You lied once. You could potentially lie again or could reasonably think that the district attorney is not exercising her independent professional judgment totally free of any compromising influences, he says. And here's the key quote As long as Wade remains on this case, the unnecessary perception will persist basically saying because of what has happened during this process, what they've learned, the fact that Mr. Wade was not always honest with the court, he said this is going to hang this cloud of distrust over this case. And he is suggesting that Nathan Wade needs to be removed. Now, he does not, as I understand it, order him to be removed. But he's walking up to the line and saying he's he's got to go. Now, some people have previously called for Nathan Wade and or Fanny Willis to step aside. Neither one of them have done that. Neither one of them have given any indication they intend to do that. But it's impossible to see really how this case would go forward, certainly not before the election with Mr. Wade at the helm. When you have the judge overseeing the case saying, look, he's got to go.",
    "Tonight, Vice President Mike Rowe, Robert F Kennedy Jr. Calling Rowe to talk about the job. Emmy Award winning TV host Mike Rowe is famously known for the hit show Dirty Jobs. And then he tweeted from the airport, quote, Boarding a flight at DFW. Dallas just saw this on a monitor Airports are funny places. And the this is, of course, that CNN graphic of RFK Jr's VP list, Mike Rowe highlighted on it right now. And he is OUTFRONT with me to talk about this and more so. All right, Mike, great to see you. Let's just start with this. Can we talk to you about possibly joining his ticket? What did he say? It's a weird world, man. I mean, you really like you're walking through an airport, your minding your own business, and you look up and there you are with the wrestler and a motivational speaker and a star athlete. Yeah, he called. Actually, I ran into him about six months ago in Dallas, totally serendipitously. And we exchanged information. And he reached out about a month ago. We had a meeting and we talked about a bunch. Mostly we talked about my foundation, and he was very kind. And it turns out this foundation I've been doing for about six years now, Mike Rowe is very much on his mind. Yeah. Micro works. So we talked about vocational training and we talked about ways to maybe get the educational system in our country a bit more egalitarian. We talked about a lot of other stuff, too. And at some point he asked me if I'd ever consider running for public office, and I spent my coffee back into my cup and said, Seriously? And he said, Yeah. And so for the first time in my life, I found myself having kind of a really serious conversation about what that even means and why I had that conversation. I'm happy to talk about it if you want, but it was it was not expected, but ultimately really kind of gratifying. And so, I mean, was he talking to you specifically about the VP role and what that meant and what that would mean to you? I mean, what can you give me more of a feel for what the conversation was about and how he behaved? Well, he's very gracious and he's very smart and he's very direct and I had no idea what I was really walking into. But his his team was there. And they were also super inquisitive. They they listened more than they talked. I wound up interviewing him. He interviewed me. We had a few laughs. It was a very friendly, very casual conversation. But he's serious. And when he talks about the things he's serious about, he leans in and it's hard not to listen. He's serious about the debt. He doesn't want to see 34 trillion get to 50. He believes if it does, the country can service it. Party's over. Are you serious about ending forever wars? He's serious about waging a war, really, on chronic disease and and diabetes and things like that. We don't agree on everything, that's for sure. And when that became apparent, he just laughed and said, look, I don't I don't want to surround myself with yes men and yes women. I want people who care about the country. I want people who tell me the truth as they see it and let the chips fall. You said a lot of stuff that was good to hear. Frankly. Did I mean, so when you talk about things you you didn't agree with him on, I mean, is there anything you can be specific on? And did he bring up things that, as you know, might have been controversial? You talk about his care for health, for example, vaccines. I mean, did topics like that come up directly? Not really, because that stuff has been so talked to death in the media that he's everybody kind of knows. All right. This is the wrap. Is there anything you want to say about it specifically? Honestly, Erin. Yeah, we did talk about some of that stuff. And I don't know that it's fair for me to to really walk you through a chapter and verse. I told him, for instance, look, I I'm friendly with a lot of people in the fossil fuel business. That's that's not a secret my foundation is supported by all sorts of people who he's sued in the past. We laughed about that and just kept coming back to look. We're living in an extraordinary time. The headlines have never been like this. The things that we seem to agree on, we appear to agree on with a certain amount of passion. And then it just became personal. To tell you the truth, look, I've been doing this foundation for 16 years at base. It's a PR campaign at base, it's an attempt to raise awareness around a couple of things that matter to me a lot. And he was very upfront about it. He said, Look, Mike, that topic education, middle class, vocational development and workforce and so forth, that that's that's the pointy part of the spear in my campaign. It matters. And if you want to see your foundation go from micro works to macro works, I think he said, then you should think about this. You should at least consider it And so I did. And consider it. You mean consider the VP slot? Sure. So I want to ask you one. One thing here is you talk about the seriousness with which RFK Jr is taking the decision that he has to make and his campaign and the people around him on his list. You mentioned a sports star. That, of course, is the NFL quarterback, Aaron Rodgers. And I don't know if you know this, but Rodgers told two people and one of those people is CNN's Pamela Brown. He told them about conspiracy theories about the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, including saying the shooting was a government inside job, that victims families were crisis actors. Do you believe that that is a serious point of view. Is that somebody that should be on a Kennedy ticket I have no idea. I think that I think he has a right to articulate whatever he wants and we have a right to respond however we want. I have no idea what the man actually said. I did see something about it today, but I don't know what qualifies or disqualifies anybody from running for anything. You know, somebody said to me the other day, a friend of mine who saw the same graphic that you put up earlier think I think her exact question was, how the hell are you qualified to do this? And I started to explain how she was right and how I wasn't. And, you know, Bobby said something to me. He said, there's so many skeletons in my closet. If you really open it up and give it a look. And that and if they could all vote, I'd be King of the world, which made me laugh. You probably find stupid stuff that anybody has said, well, what really qualifies a man or woman to run for president or vice president? I think you've got to be 35. I think you need to have been born in this country after that. I don't know about qualifications. I guess we could talk experience and judgment and temperament and all of those other things, and everybody gets to weigh and measure everybody and put it all under a microscope and and disagree and decide. Personally, I stopped watching football after the Colts left Baltimore, so I don't know how much use I can be on that. Oh, wow. I wouldn't even think we'd have a Baltimore connection like that. All right. They broke my heart and they broke my heart. As a Marylander. I hear you. All right. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time, Mike. And it's always great to see you.

    "SUPPORT. FOUR IS REAL. WE KNOW  THAT HAMAS HAS TO GO JOINING ME NOW IS FAREED ZAKARIA. HE'S THE   FREED GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON  TONIGHT. CAN YOU PUT THIS INTO  PERSPECTIVE FOR US HOW   IMPORTANT IS THIS FOR THE US   ISRAELI RELATIONSHIP?   >> I THINK IT'S A WATERSHED.  SENATOR SCHUMER IS NOT SOMEBODY WHO IS LIKELY TO FREELANCE. AS  YOU POINT OUT HERE, IS THE MOST SENIOR JEWISH AMERICAN OFFICIAL IN THE UNITED STATES. SHE'S  ALSO VERY CLOSE TO PRESIDENT  BIDEN AND TO BIDEN'S TEAM I  SUSPECT THAT THIS WAS THAT  THERE WAS SOME CONSULTATION  HERE. AND WHAT IT REFLECTS, I  THINK IS A VERY DEEP  FRUSTRATION THAT THE BIDEN   ADMINISTRATION HAS HAD WITH THE NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT. THEY HAVE PROVIDED REALLY UNQUALIFIED  SUPPORT OF A, ON A SCALE THAT  IS UNPRECEDENTED IN ISRAEL, JOE BIDEN IS WILDLY POPULAR FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY AND UNQUALIFIED  SUPPORT HE GAVE. BUT IN RETURN, HE HAS TRIED TO COUNSEL THE  NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT TO BE  PROPORTIONATE, NOT TO LAUNCH A  MAJOR GROUND INVASION, NOT THE  LEVEL 50% OF THE BUILDINGS IN  GAZA, NOT TO DO IN THE SOUTH,  WHAT THEY DID IN THE NORTH. AND AT EVERY TURN, THE NETANYAHU  GOVERNMENT HAS DEFIED AND   DISAGREED AND GONE ON AND DONE  WHATEVER IT WANTED. SO I THINK  THIS COMES AFTER A VERY LONG   PERIOD, MONTHS OF THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION PATIENTLY AND  QUIET HI AT LEAK COUNSELING,  THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT TO TAKE  A DIFFERENT COURSE AND  RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE BEING  AN ENORMOUS PRICE  INTERNATIONALLY AND THE UNITED  STATES IS PAYING AN ENORMOUS  PRICE BECAUSE AS IDF GENERALS  POINT OUT REPEATEDLY, WITHOUT  AMERICAN SUPPORT, NONE OF THESE OPERATIONS WOULD BE POSSIBLE   AND SO IT IS, I THINK IT THIS   MAY BE THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK AS IT MORE, BUT IT COMES AFTER MONTHS OF  FRUSTRATION.   >> I WONDER WHAT THE IMPORT OF  IT IS AT THE END OF THE DAY. I  MEAN, AS YOU POINTED OUT, LET  ME ARE WHO HAS BASICALLY BEEN  IGNORING THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION ON ALL OF THEIR  LINES DRAWN IN THE SAND ON ALL  OF THE THINGS THAT THEY PUT ON  THE TABLE AND SAID, DO NOT DO   THIS. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO NOW?   >> LET'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION  THERE. THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE  MANY CHOICES. THIS IS AFTER  ALL, A SENATOR WHO IS   EXPRESSING AN OPINION AND HE IS NOT CALLING AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID, FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE  REGIME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.  HE'S SIMPLY SAYING ISRAEL  FACES A COMPLETELY NEW SECURITY SURELY SITUATION, AND THEY  SHOULD HAVE NEW ELECTIONS THAT  HIS OPINION HE IS NOT THE  ADMINISTRATION IS THE   LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND AT THIS  POINT, THE ADMINISTRATION HAS  TO ASK, IS IT GOING TO DO  SOMETHING WHAT COULD IT DO?  PRESTON BIDEN COULD MAKE A  SPEECH IN WHICH HE FOCUSES ON  ISRAELI POLICIES AND WHERE THEY SHOULD GO AND WHETHER GOING  WRONG THE UNITED STATES HAS  VETOED ALMOST EVERY CALL FOR A  CEASEFIRE AND THE UNITED  NATIONS IT'S BEEN OFTEN THE  LOAN VOTE SUPPORTING ISRAEL. IT COULD CHANGE THAT IT COULD ALSO CONDITION THE AID THAT IT GIVES THE MILITARY AID AND SAY THESE  WEAPONS CANNOT BE USED. FOR   EXAMPLE, IN ANY, ANY FURTHER   OFFENSIVE SUCH AS AN INVASION  OF RAFAH.   >> SO IT DOES HAVE VARIOUS  TOOLS THAT IT HAS. AND I THINK  THIS WAS A WAY OF TRYING TO   SIGNAL THEIR DISPLEASURE   WITHOUT THE PLEA ADMINISTRATION FORMALLY ESCALATING ALONG THE  LINES I WAS DESCRIBING A   WARNING OF SORTS, PERHAPS I   WONDER THOUGH. I MEAN, LOOK THE FATE OF NETANYAHU WHEN THIS WAR AND IT SEEMS BASED ON POLLING  INSIDE OF ISRAEL, HE WOULD NOT  REMAIN IN POWER. SO WHAT  HAPPENS NEXT IS THERE ANY   COALITION GOVERNMENT THAT YOU  SEE? IN THE WAITING IN THE  WINGS THAT IS CAPABLE OF   BRINGING THIS WAR TO AN END AND MOVING ISRAEL AND GAZA AND THE  WEST BANK INTO A FUTURE THAT  ACTUALLY LEADS TO PEACE OH,   ABSOLUTELY.  >> ISRAEL HAS MANY VERY   SEASONED POLITICAL LEADERS WHO  HAVE VIEWS DIFFERENT FROM   NETANYAHU. MANY OF THEM HAVE  SERVED IN THE MILITARY AND  SENIOR POSITIONS, WHICH BIBI  NETANYAHU HAS NOT KNOW ISRAEL  IS FULL OF POLITICAL TALENT YOU KNOW, THE QUESTION IS, AS YOU  SAY, RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL FROM THE POLLING, A DEEP   DISSATISFACTION WITH PRIME  MINISTER NETANYAHU. I THINK  THAT SOME POLLS I'VE SEEN UP TO 70% OF THE PEOPLE THINK HE  SHOULD, HE SHOULD NOT BE PRIME  MINISTER AFTER THE WAR IS OVER. AND IN A WAY, SCHUMER WAS  REFLECTING THAT FEELING THERE  IS, THERE ARE CERTAINLY PEOPLE  IN ISRAEL WHO BELIEVED THAT  THEY CAN, THEY CAN FIND A MORE  LASTING WAY TO ACHIEVE SECURITY FOR ISRAEL.  >> THEN   >> A KIND OF ENDLESS AND  INTENSE GROUND OPERATION THAT ",
    "DIFFERENCE AT MOON POD.CO   >> TONIGHT'S BREAKING NEWS AND ONE FROM TRIAL WHICH WE  REPORTED THE TOP OF THE  BROADCAST COMMS HARD ON THE  HEELS OF POTENTIALLY GOOD  BREAKING NEWS FOR HIM IN  ANOTHER, WE'VE LEARNED THE  MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY  ALVIN BRAGG, IS OKAY WITH  POSTPONING HIS HUSH MONEY  TRIAL. IF THE JUDGE AGREES THIS COMES JUST DAYS AFTER FEDERAL  PROSECUTORS HANDED OVER  THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS FROM THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION   AFTER WHICH THEY DECIDED NOT TO BRING CHARGES. AS YOU KNOW, THE NEW YORK TRIAL IS SET TO BEGIN  ON THE 25th OF THIS MONTH,  PUSHING IT AHEAD A MONTH WOULD  MEAN IT COULD BEGIN THE SAME  DAY. THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID FOR ORAL ARGUMENTS ON  PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY IN THE  JANUARY 6 CASE THE FOREIGN  PRESIDENT COURSE DOES NOT HAVE  TO BE THERE FOR THAT, BUT HE  WILL HAVE TO ATTEND HIS  CRIMINAL TRIAL, JOIN HIS NOW  WITH MORRISON AND CHIEF LEGAL  AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT PAULA  REID. SO HOW DID THIS HAPPEN  WITH THE TRIAL DATE LESS THAN  TWO WEEKS AWAY?   >> ANDERSON, I THINK THE JUDGE  IS GOING TO HAVE THE SAME EXACT QUESTION. IF THIS IS A SURPRISE TWIST, CERTAINLY GIVES A BOOST  TO TRUMP WHO HAS BEEN EMPLOYING THE STRATEGY I'M JUST TRYING TO DELAY ALL OF HIS CRIMINAL CASES AND DELAYS AHEAD OF TRIALS.   THAT'S NOT AN UNUSUAL  OCCURRENCE. BUT HERE, THIS   DELAY IS THE RESULT OF THE FACT THAT BOTH SIDES NOW NEED TO   REVIEW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF  PAGES OF EVIDENCE THAT WAS ONLY HANDED OVER BY FEDERAL  PROSECUTORS ON WEDNESDAY.  >> REMEMBER THIS IS A STATE  CASE SO THIS IS INFORMATION  COMING FROM PREVIOUS FEDERAL  INVESTIGATIONS WHY IS IT JUST   COMING IN NOW? WHAT DEPENDS WHO YOU ASK.  >> THE TRUMP   >> TEAM INSISTS THAT THE  MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY  THAT IS BRINGING THIS CASE  AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT THEY HAVE WITHHELD IT, BUT  PROSECUTORS INSIST THAT THE   TRUMP TEAM JUST WAITED UNTIL  EARLIER THIS YEAR TO SUBPOENA  THE EVIDENCE AS PART OF AN  EFFORT TO DELAY. NOW, THE TRUMP TEAM WANTS TO PUSH THIS CASE  BACK 90 DAYS. PROSECUTORS SAY  THEY WOULDN'T OBJECT TO A 30  DAY DELAY, BUT ULTIMATELY,  IT'LL BE UP TO THE JUDGE.  >> AND DO WE KNOW WHEN THE  JUDGE MEGA DECISION WILL   UNDERSTAND THIS CASE WAS   SCHEDULED TO START AT TEN DAYS. SO I WOULD EXPECT A DECISION  QUITE SOON. OPEN QUESTION  THOUGH, IS WHETHER THIS JUDGE  IS GOING TO WANT TO HAVE A  HEARING OR A TELECONFERENCE   JUST TO PRESS THE PARTIES AND  SOME OF THESE ISSUES, BUT I  WOULD EXPECT THIS IN A MATTER  OF DAYS.   >> AND DOES SO HOW DOES THAT  IMPACT THE OVERALL CALENDAR AND TRUMP'S COURT CASE? BECAUSE  THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE   FIRST ONE.  >> YEAH. AND IT WAS THE ONLY   ONE THAT WAS FIRMLY ON THE  CALENDAR. NOW, WITH THE HELP OF OUR CALENDAR GRAPHIC HERE MEAN  THE OTHER THREE CRIMINAL TRIALS RIGHT NOW ARE IN LIMBO. THE  JANUARY 6 FEDEL L PROSECUTION.  IT'S UNCLEAR WHEN THAT'S GOING TO GO OR IF IT'LL GO AT ALL.  BECAUSE IN APRIL, THE SUPREME   COURT WILL HEAR ARGUMENTON  WHETHER FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP  HAS IMMUNITY TO SHIELD HIM FROM THAT CASE. AND THEN WE DON'T  EXPECT A DECISION THERE UNTIL   PROBABLY MID TO LATE JUNE NOW,  IN MAY, YOU SEE THE CLASSIFIED  DOCUMENTS TRIAL IS THERE LOOK,  THAT'S JUST IN PENCIL. WE WERE IN COURT TWO WEEKS A WHERE  THE JUDGE, AILEEN CANNON, A   TRUMP APPOINTEE, SHE HEARD  ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHEN SHE COULD  PUSH THAT BACK AT BASED ON WHAT WE HEARD WHILE I WAS DOWN IN  FLORIDA ANDERSON, I THINK SHE  WOULD PROBABLY PUT THAT ON   AUGUST AT THE EARLIEST YOU ALSO HAVE THE GEORGIA CASE THAT FANI WILLIS SAID SHE WANTED TO BRING IN AUGUST. CURRENTLY, THERE IS, OF COURSE, AN OPEN QUESTION OF  WHETHER SHE WILL SELL OVERSEE  THAT CASE. THOSE EFFORTS TO   DISQUALIFY HER CERTAINLY WILL  HAVE DELAYED THAT CASE BEYOND   AUGUST. SO ANDERSON, WITH THIS  NEW REQUEST FOR A DELAY, WE'LL SEE WHAT THE JUDGE DOES. BUT  RIGHT NOW, IT IS NOT CLEAR IF  FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL  FACE ANYMINAL PROSECUTION  BEFORE NOVEMBER.  >> ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.  THANKS. BACKWARD. JEFF TUBE AND JENNIFER RODGERS AND ANDREW  MCCABE ALSO JOINING US.   MARGARET HOOVER, HOST OF FIRING LINE ON PBS INTER DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. YOU SOUTHERN THAT  FEDERAL PROSECUTORS. WHY WOULD  THEY JUST NOW SEND THIS STUFF   OVER? I KNOW THEY WERE  SUBPOENAED, BUT COULDN'T HAVE  SENT THIS STUFF TO THE  MANHATTAN DA EARLIER.   >> THERE'S NOT A GOOD ANSWER  FOR THAT QUESTION THERE. I   THINK ON THE SURFACE, THE   MULTIPLE PROSECUTORS OFFICES IN NEW YORK'S YOU HAVE MANHATTAN  AND THEN YOU HAVE THE TWO   FEDERAL PROSECUTION OFFICES,  THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT AND THE   EASTERN DISTRICT. ON THE  SURFACE, WE ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT  GOOD COOPERATION. THE LAW  ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY ENTITY.  BUT IN THE NITTY-GRITTY OF  INDIVIDUAL CASES, IN MY OWN   EXPERIENCE FOR HAVING BEEN AN   AGENT THERE FOR A DECADE OR SO    >> THESE   >> THESE REQUESTS FOR EVIDENCE  OR ACCESS TO EACH OTHER'S   WITNESSEE OFTEN FRAUGHT  WITH COMPETITION AND   DEFENSIVENESS. PROSECUTORS WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL BEFORE THEY  TURN OVER DOCUMENTS TO ANOTHER  PROSECUTOR'S OFFICES TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO USE  THEM OR NEED THEM AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE, I WOULD EXPECT  THERE WERE SOME CALCULATIONS   LIKE THAT INVOLVED OR BASIC   BUREAUCRATIC DELAY. IT TAKES A  LOT OF APPROVALS AND UP THE  CHAIN OF COMMAND. WELL, I MEAN, JENNIFER, IN THE   >> FILING, DA BRAGG BLAMES THE  FORMER PRESIDENT'S LEGAL TEAM  SAYING THAT THEY DIDN'T PRIOR  TO SEEK THE RECORDS UNTIL  JANUARY. HE WROTE, WE NOTE THAT THE TIMING OF THE CURRENT  PRODUCTION OF ADDITIONAL  MATERIALS FROM THE US A0 IS A  FUNCTION OF DEFENDANT'S OWN  DELAY, BUT I MEAN, IF BRAGG  KNEW THIS MATERIAL WAS OUT  THERE, COULDN'T HE HAVE ASKED  FOR IT?  >> YEAH. IT DEPENDS WHAT IT IS  AND WE DON'T HAVE A GREAT IDEA ABOUT THAT. WE MAY LEARN MORE   WHEN THEY FILE THEIR ACTUAL  SUBSTANTIVE RESPONSE, EITHER  TOMORROW OR MONDAY. BUT IT  SOUNDS LIKE AT LEAST SOME OF  THESE MATERIALS, A LOT OF THEM  ARE BANK RECORDS AND THINGS  THAT PROBABLY AREN'T SO  CRITICAL. BUT SOME OF THEM AT  LEAST OUR STATEMENTS OF PEOPLE  LIKE MICHAEL COHEN WHO'S GOING TO BE A WITNESS, THAT STUFF  THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THE  DEFECTION HAVE. SO IF THERE ARE STATEMENTS OF MICHAEL COHEN  THAT WEREN'T TURNED OVER  PREVIOUSLY, THEY NEED TO HAVE  THEM. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ALVIN BRAGG KNEW THAT THE FED'S HAD  IS THE PROBLEM.  >> BUT JEFF, DOES THAT MAKE   SENSE TO YOU?  >> THIS IS ALL SO OUTRAGEOUS.  YOU'RE ALL BEING VERY POLITE  HERE HERE.  >> I MEAN, THE US ATTORNEY'S  OFFICE IN MANHATTAN, THE  SOUTHERN DISTRICT, ACCORDING TO THE MANHATTAN DA THE DA ASKED  FOR THESE DOCUMENTS LAST YEAR  AND THE US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE  FOR WHATEVER REASON, CHOSE NOT  TO TURN THEM OVER AS A RESULT,  THEY ONLY TURN THEM OVER JUST   VERY RECENTLY, WHICH THE DA  SAYS IS ALL THE SOUTHERN  DISTRICTS FALL. WHY DIDN'T THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT COOPERATE  WITH THESE FELLOW PROSECUTOR?  >> I MEAN, IF IT OBVIOUSLY  ALVIN BRAGG, I WOULD THINK  WOULD WANT TO SEE ANY  INTERVIEWS THAT MICHAEL COHEN  GAVE.  >> AND HE ASKED FOR THEM AND HE ASKED FOR THEM. AND THE US  ATTORNEY SAID NO. AND THE US  ATTORNEY APPARENTLY HAS  THOUSANDS MORE RECORDS THAT   THEY'RE GOING TO TURN OVER  SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE, WHICH   COULD LEAD TO MORE DELAYS. AND  BY THE WAY, ONCE THESE RECORDS  ARE TURNED OVER, YOU CAN BE  SURE THE DEFENSE IS GOING TO   SAY, WELL, THIS RAISES A WHOLE  NEW SET OF ISSUES. SO WE HAVE  TO FILE MORE MOTIONS AND ASKED  FOR MORE DELAYS. THIS IS A   EMBARRASSMENT TO THE LAW  ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. AND THE  ONLY BENEFICIARY IS DONALD  TRUMP   >> VOW MARGARET?   >> YES. I CAME KEPT WAITING FOR YOU TO BLAME AND Y, BUT YOU'RE JUST TOO POLITE.  >> I MEAN,   >> I DID TEXAS THE FORMER ST.  NY PROSECUTOR EARLIER WHEN I  SAID YOU GUYS SCREWED THIS UP,  RIGHT   >> YOU SAID? YES AND YES. I  MEAN, IT WAS ALL ON BACKGROUND. OF COURSE. I'M AND HOW CAN THEY SCREW UP A CASE WHICH YOU  UNDERSTAND OUR EYES ARE WIDE  OPEN HERE. THIS IS NOT LIKE   YOU'VE GOT A MASSIVE FIREWALL. ALL OF THIS IS PLAYING OUT IN  THE PRESS. IF YOU HAVE  DOCUMENTS THAT ARE GERMANE,  SHARE THEM IMMEDIATELY. THIS IS RELEVANT. I DON'T YOU CAN I  GET THAT? BUT IT'S NOT  UNCOMMON PROSECUTORS   APPROACHING EACH OTHER WITH  ANSWERING REQUESTS FOR   DOCUMENTS. IT USUALLY COMES AT  AN ARM'S LENGTH. WELL, I'LL  THINK ABOUT IT AND WHEN I GET  AROUND TO IT, I'LL I'LL  CALCULATE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT  THERE'S A ONE IN 1 MILLION  CHANCE I MIGHT NEED THESE   DOCUMENTS FOR MY OWN CASE. AND  IF THERE IS, YOU'RE NEVER   GETTING THEM SO THAT'S THE SORT OF RELUCTANCE THAT GOES INTO  THESE REQUESTS. IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS CASE.   >> I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH  THIS, BUT HERE WE USE A WORD  FOR THAT POLICY.  >> IT'S BAD. BAD   >> POLICY TO HAVE PROSECUTORS   FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER AND  NOT COOPERATING WITH EACH OTHER WHEN THAT IS WAS THERE AN   ATTITUDE AT THE SOUTHERN  GERMANY? YOU SHOULD HAVE NEW  YORK WHERE THEY THOUGHT, OH,  THIS BRAGG CASES KIND OF THIN  GIRL AND WE DON'T HAVE TO I  CAN I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT THAT  THEY WOULDN'T WEIGH IN ON  SOMEBODY ELSE'S CASE, WHAT THEY WOULD DO, MAYBE SAY, MAYBE WE  STILL HAVE A STRAND OF THIS  INVESTIGATION THAT'S OPEN.  WE'RE NOT GOING TO TURN THIS  OVER FOR SOME REASON THAT THEY  HAVE AS OF THIS CASE  EMBARRASSES THEM TOO. SOME   DEGREE, RIGHT? HERE'S ALVIN  BRAGG, BASICALLY MAKING A CASE  THAT THEY WALKED AWAY FROM THAT DOES NOT SHROUD THEM IN  PROSECUTORIAL AGGRESSION AND  GLORY, WHICH IS WHERE THEY  PREFER TO BEIJING   >> THE RESPONSE TO THAT IS TO  NOT GIVE OVER EVIDENCE WHICH  MAKES THEM LOOK EVEN WORSE.  >> I MEAN, THAT'S AND THAT'S  WHY I DON'T THINK THAT THAT  WAS THE REASON. I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER NOW IN  RESPONSE TO A SUBPOENAS JUST  GOING TO LOOK WORSE. I CAN'T  IMAGINE THEY MADE THAT  DELIBERATE DECISION NOT TO TURN IT OVER BEFOREHAND, BUT WE'LL  MAYBE WE'LL KNOW MORE WHEN THEY MORGAN FOR THE FORMER  PRESIDENT, THIS IS A HUGE  POLITICAL WHEN YOU DELAY,   DELAY, WHEN, WHEN, WHEN   DYSFUNCTION AND IT FEEDS INTO  ALL THE THERE IS ALL THE ALL  THE FAKE NEWS AND CONSPIRACY  THERE AS IT IS, HE'S WHINING UP ANYWHERE. I MEAN, THE TRUTH IS  THAT THIS ISN'T THE CASE,  WHICH I MEAN, WE KNOW THIS  ISN'T THE CASE WHEN I WENT TO  TRIAL THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE  CASE. THAT IS AT LEAST FROM A  P  IS GOING TO HELP THE OPPOSITION ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED  ABOUT TRUMP RETURNING TO THE  PRESIDENCY REALLY MAKE THE   POLITICAL ARGUMENT THAT LIKE  THIS, HE SHOULDN'T GO BACK TO  THE PRESIDENCY BECAUSE OF A   BUSINESS MISDEMEANOR THAT WAS  WORTH ABOUT $130,000. I MEAN,  THAT'S NOT THE CASE. IT'S THE CASE WHERE HE TOOK SECRET   DOCUMENTS AND TOP SECRET   DOCUMENTS AND HIDDEN THEM IN  SHOWER IN MAR-A-LAGO ILLEGALLY. THAT'S THE CASE. YOU WANT TO  LITIGATE POLITICALLY NATIONALLY IN THE MONTHS BEFORE AND WEEKS  BEFORE THE NATIONAL ELECTIONS,  PRESIDENTIAL ACTUALLY, THAT'S A LITTLE UNFAIR TO THE MANHATTAN  DA'S CASE.  >> I   >> MEAN, THE MANHATTAN DA'S  CASE, AT LEAST THE WAY THEY'RE PUTTING IT IS THAT THE REASON   ALL OF THIS MONEY WENT TO   STORMY DANIELS WAS TO HIDE  STUFF FROM THE VOTERS ON THE  EVE OF THE 2016, THEY'RE SAYING IT'S AN ELECTION INTERFERENCE  ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE.   >> WHICH MAKES ITS DEMEANOR AS  A NORMAL BUSINESS FROM KATE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S JUST NO PRECEDENT FOR THAT. WELL,  THERE'S NO   >> PRECEDENT FOR A LOT OF  THINGS, DONALD. BUT BUT IT IS  ALSO TRUE THAT IF HE'S  CONVICTED, HE WILL BE A   CONVICTED FELON AND IN AMERICA, THAT'S USUALLY CONSIDERED NOT  A GOOD QUALIFICATION TO BE  PRESIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES. DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO  GO TO DRAMA FOR THE ELECTION? I DO. I THINK OF THIS ONE. I   THINK WILL SOMEHOW STAGGERED A  TRIAL IN SOME TIME IN THE   SPRING.  >> AND TO YOUR POLITICAL POINT, ACTUALLY, THE POLLING BEARS OUT THAT IF HE IS CONVICTED IN ANY  TRIAL OR IN ANY CASE IN ALL OF  THE SEVEN TIPPING POINT  JURISDICTIONS, STATES THAT ARE  CLOSE THAT WILL DECIDE THE  ELECTION. THIS DRAMATICALLY   CHANGES WHAT PEOPLE SAY   POLLSTERS,",
    "Caitlin, let me start with you, because Judge Kennard already rejecting one of Trump's motions So what more can you tell us about the hearing today, that hearing where, of course, he chose to be in-person? Well, Erin, there was no delay today from Judge Cannon in her decision to reject one of Trump's argumen But what is happening here in this case is Trump is putting all of his defense ar before the judge asking her to dismiss the case. She's looking at those one by on Today, she looked at two of nine of those arguments that he and his co-defendants ar all different arguments about why they think the case should be dismissed. And we've gotten one ruling that after he argued that the law was too vague around national defense secrets, she said. That's not something that I'm going to decide. That might be something you may want to argue to a jury  or we could look at later on and argue in this case. But I'm not dismissing the case right now. There still is another argument that was made in court today about Donald Trump keeping the records that were removed from the White and that he took to Mar a Lago a after he left the presidency, that those were his personal rec Judge Eileen Cannon seemed pretty skeptical of that. But now we wait to see exactly what she will do. She's been very cautious not to tip her hand in court, th she did a bit today. She did said she had some skepti toward Trump and his lawyers for what they were arguing today But everyone here in this case,  very clear that there a lot of work to do. There's a long road ahead of the They've spent hours and hours in court together. Trump himself in court seems to be quite comfortable chatting with his lawyers, liste Our reporters and our producers in the room today even caught some people maybe nodding off as this hearing dragged on well into the afternoon. But there are many, many hours a and many rulings to come from. Judge Eileen Cannon. Before we get to a trial. Before we get to a trial or even a known trial date. Caitlin Polanco, thank you so much, Caitlin, at that courthouse today. And I want to go now to Evan Per because he is closely following the late developments I mentioned in the Trump Hush Money case, that first criminal case that was scheduled to start in t Evan. And now maybe not, maybe not for another 30 days. Yeah, at least 30 days, Erin. It's almost certain that the jud is going to delay this trial because now the district attorney, Alvin Bragg, is saying that they with delaying this by at least 3 up to 30 days. The Trump team had asked for a 90 day dela because they said various discovery problems. This is the the whole principle that the pro has a duty to turn over every all documents that are relevant  in order for the defense to be a to be able to to to to prepare for trial, of c So what has happened, according  district attorney, is that just  they received about 31,000 pages of documents from the Justice Department that the defense had requested. Now, these are documents. We don't know exactly what these documents are, but we know that these were docu that the defense said that they had requested from the Justice Department, because, as you know, the Justice Department had investigated this, these allegations of the that of paying hush money ahead of the 2016 election. They had looked at it in the Trump administration and also looked at it in the Biden administration and declined to prosecute. So those documents were under a  from the defense and some of those documents only came in yesterday. Here's t According to this filing from the district attorney, there may be more documents that may be coming in. So the issue now becomes how long this judge delays this trial, as you pointed out. This was supposed to start in less than two weeks. And so the question is, does he go with 30 days? Does he go all the way to 90 day which is what Trump is asking or somewhere in between Erin. All right. Thank you very much, Evan Perez in Washington. And OUTFRONT now, the former Trump White House lawyer, Ty Cob So, Ty, obviously every developm is significant in terms of the ripple effect it could have. And Judge can and I lean can in rejecting one of Trump's key motions to dismiss the case  But you think that it may still have been a go for Trump. Explain how come? Because it was a day and, you know, DeLay is his whole objective. Every day counts. The the the fact that she denied the mot is really sort of inconsequentia in my view, because, you know, all nine motions to dismiss are frivolous It wouldn't take most judges a w you know, decisively rule on all Not sure why argument is even re The positions that Trump's lawyers have taken are so absurd. But I think, you know, it's good that today she came to court prepared for c She actually issued a ruling on one of the motions that was argued but not the othe The other motion, frankly, is an easier motion to dismiss for for the court to dis And say that Trump's wrong because it's even more absurd than the one that she did dismis On the on the vagueness issue. So, you know, anything that slows things down and, you know, she doesn't she just doesn't have this on a schedule that, you know, is likely to get the case resolved before the are even to trial before the election. And I think sort of any trial da that she ultimately sets, you know, even if she goes with the defendant's suggested trial date in August over the Smith trial d you know, a month or so earlier, the reality is that Dad'll move  This case is not going to go to  before the election. And I think, you know, everything that she has done to date ensures that. Which is an incredible bottom li when you think about it. And I think the context is so im of what you're saying, that those nine motions as you see them are frivolous, that she could rule on them. You don't need every time to have a hearing and a date and an argument in co And yet that is that is what's h You know, Gallup poll has described Eileen Cannon as skeptical of the notion that Trump had the power to designate records as personal and take them with him to Mar a Lago in his presidency ended. But she did say that that could be a, quote, forceful trial defense. So it's sort of unclear where she stood, at least from t Is there any merit to that argum None. And, in fact, you know, at 30,00 you have to ask yourself, how would that ever get in front of the jury? The only way for that to get in front of the jury, the argument that Trump had designated the documents is personal to him Yes. If Trump testifies and Trump's never going to testi I mean, he would get eviscerated So, you know, in the absence of any evidence that supports a legal argument, you can't make the argument. The arguments have to be based on the evidence and based on the facts and based on the on the jury instructions relevant to the jury instruction And there is no, you know, jury instruction that says, you know, under the under the PR the Public Records Act, that a p can designate things personal to if he so decides. That's that's not in the law. It's not in the statute. It's just sort of a silly argume and it has no no legal support. I remember the day when he was l you know, I just have to sort of think about it. And it is so the Alvin Bragg situation, ob Trump's team had asked for 90 days of a delay Alvin Bragg came out and is agre And essentially the delay is nec Right. Clearly saying 30 days that they would go with 30 days. What does this mean? Well, it's what it means for sure is that the case will be de You know, Judge Marchant is not  risk being reversed on, you know, forcing, you know, the trial to date earl than both both the prosecution and the defense agree is appropr I think it's also means that, yo the DA's office just as badly manage this case. These documents, you know, have been out there for two year ever since the Southern district not to pursue charges against the former president after having prosecuted my clien Keep in mind that both the SCC and the Southern District concluded this case, you know, required no no action. And they and they both passed on And then Braxton came up with this tortur you know, misdemeanor attached to a federal crime theory that you kn has no precedent that supports i and for a case that you know even if he ever gets to trial, is going to be inconsequential f like going to go to jail. In this case, it's $130,000 a first offense under the New York guidelines. That's just not that's not worthy of any jail ti And it'll be on appeal when he g if he gets elected, it'll be on  during that time. And it wouldn't be enforceable f you know, four more years. So it's sort of it's sort of an unusual case to gum up the wo and moving it back. Of course, you know, screws up other timelines like the, you know, the potential for eith the classified documents case or the January six case to get t All right. Well, Ty Cobb, thank you very mu",

Number nine, what that in effect you're dirty feet. Number 11, was that an insight your verdict it is. During sleep numbers while was that is that your verdict?\n>> Yes it. Is during seat number 13, why is that is that your verdict? It is. Stirring. Seek number 14. Was that and is that your verdict >> Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, I know how hard this has been on all of you, despite reading your face I know this has been a very hard decision. We appreciate your time. I'm going to ask you to return to the jury room and I'll be there. Are there with you in a few minutes? All right? >> All rise for the jury >> James Crumbley >> Found guilty of all >> Four counts of involuntary manslaughter, or you heard each of the jurors their confirmed that was their verdict Whitney wild. We were able to look at James Crumbley, the father of Ethan Crumbley, who killed four of his classmates, murdered four of his classmates. His father James, now convicted of involuntary manslaughter. He was wearing those sort of headphones. He has a hearing impairment. You could see him visibly shaking his head each time the word guilty was said by the foreperson of that jury >> Well, that's right. Aaron and his defense and continuously argued that he had no knowledge that his son posed any the harm to anyone else and that in fact, he had tried to keep a firearm out of Ethan Crumbley's hands by hiding it in an arm war in his, in his bedroom, and then separating out the ammunition and hiding it under eighth a pair of jeans and it was really the it's two these two elements that prosecutors really dug into in the case. And it was this idea that Ethan Crumbley had declining mental health and it was obvious to everyone and someone should have act specifically, his parents should have acted because there were just signs over and over and over four months leading up to the shooting that he pose a risk to those around him, as well as to himself. So that was the first thing. And then specifically with the James Crumbley trial and a really dug into the securing of the firearm a couple of pieces of evidence that prosecutors brought forth again, was the idea that you this hand going to happen stored, but it didn't have a a lock on the firearm I made it takes just seconds to lock up a firearm with a walk that is standard that comes in a kit with a handgun. He didn't do that. That was one of the things that prosecutors really dug into. We can't know what piece of evidence it was that pushed the jury in this direction, but other pieces of evidence that they brought forth included a April of I've 2021 text message that Ethan Crumbley sent to a friend. >> And in it, >> He said that he had told his father that he was hearing people talk to him and seeing someone in the distance. And here's a quote from the text from Ethan to his friend. I actually asked my dad to take me to the Dr. Yesterday, but he just gave me some pills and told me to suck it up. So those are some major pieces of evidence, Aaron, that that jurors heard throughout the trial. This trial saw 15 witnesses for prosecutor spread over five days. The defense brought just one witness, James Crumbley, sister, Karen Crumbley, who said that she saw the family and April and that again in June 2021 and she did not see anything that seemed off anything concerning at all. But another piece of evidence, Aaron. And just to wrap it up, that button, prosecutors really leaned into was this idea that it was James Crumbley who brought Ethan to the gun range several times, at least six times from June 2021 through November, and that it was James Crumbley who bought the firearm, but you can eventually use to kill those four students and injure several others at his high school. >> Whitney. Thank you very much. And it is a significant verdict of this guilty verdict for James Crumbley, the father of Ethan Crumbley. This also follows the guilty the verdict for Ethan Crumbley's mother, Jennifer Crumbley, who was tried separately and is awaiting sentencing in early April guilty on all four counts. Ethan Crumbley killed",
    "The North Carolina Republican nominee for  Mark Robinson, as we've reported has a long history of anti-Semitic, anti LGBTQ sexist  Now, just this past Saturday, Robinson told a crowd at a Republican fundraiser in Naples, Florida, that it's time to stand up and f Law enforcement. Take a listen. We once again to be the leaders of freedom in this nation. And it starts with us having a conversation in the mirror. Can I do it? Am I willing when the chips are down, when the FBI is knocking on my d Well, I count. Will I comply or will I stand up and fight? Folks, this time to stand up and FBI knocking on your door. We reached out to Robinson's cam for him to explain the context of that remark. His communications director says, quote, He was clearly encouraging folks to mobilize at the ballot  to vote against Biden and the Democrats and their cont weaponization of the justice sys against their political opponents, unquote. Now, Mr. Robinson is not the only controversial statewide candidat in North Carolina currently. Which brings us to the Republica to run North Carolina schools, who has tweete about putting Democrats to death Her name is Michelle Mauro. Here's one of her tweets. Take a look. It's a doctored photo of former President Barack Obama in an electric chair. Mora wrote Death to all Traitors Hashtag Obama gate. Again, this is the Republican no to oversee public schools in North Carolina. Home of the Research Triangle. Joining us now, CNN's K File senior reporter Andrew Kosinski. Andrew, that's not even all of i There's a lot more. Well, that's right, Jake. Last week, Morrow, a conservative activist, won the nomination, upsetting the incumbent North Carolina school superintendent. That's the state's top school job while she was calling schools indoctrination centers and socialism centers. She's also been linked to the Q  conspiracy theories, sharing a slogan associated with AQ and on where we go one, we go all at least seven times on Twitter. She's also promoted the baseless Adrina Chrome conspiracy, which claims that celebrities harvest the blood of children. And she has also made extreme an Muslim comments, all of this while repeatedly talking about executing prominent Democrats. Take a look at this tweet right here from May of 2020, where she's responding to someone who say it says they want to see Obama tossed in Gitmo. Marshall wrote, quote, I prefer  view of him in front of the firi I do not want to waste another dime on supporting his l We could make some money back from televising his death. In another tweet from December 2 Morrow suggested executing Joe Biden, who was the president elect, because he had asked Americans to wear a mask for 100 days at the height of the COVID 19 pandemic, saying, quote, We n We need to follow the Constitution's advice, and that in all caps kill all tr We also found numerous other twe about executing Democrats in posts on social media. She tweeted the hashtag Death to at least 12 times. But, Jake, those comments are her controversial comments really extended beyond that. She repeatedly shared that unfounded claim that Obama was a muslim. She called Islam evil and even expressed belief in a very bizarre conspiracy theory that Chinese troops were going to invade the United  to help Joe Biden be sworn in as preside There's a tweet I want people to look at right here from her where she wrote, quote, Tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers are already in Canada and probably Mexico waiting for orders to invade. Now, if Morrow wins and becomes the superintendent of North Carolina schools, she's going to have oversight of an $11 billion budget and, of course, education for the state's 1.3 million K through 12 student My mom was a my mom went to a public school in North Carolina. This is I mean, this is highly disturbin What is more to say about these deranged tweets? What does she have to say about  So we reached out to her campaig We reached out to her personally and we didn't hear back from either of them. We also reached out to the North Republican Party and we didn't h So it's going to be really inter to see how all of this is going to play in North Carolina in 2024. It's obviously such an important swing state. Mark Robinson, who's at the top of the ticket, as you mentioned, has that history of extremely controversial comme And this was a state that Trump beat Biden by in 2020 with his smallest margin. So all of this at the top of the ticket down ballot, it's going to be a big factor in Kay Files, Andrew Kaczynski, thank you so m Good to have you back.",
    "We are also following a major hearing in Trump's Mar a Lago classified documents case And again, I know it's tough to keep all of these straight, but remember, this is the case where Donald Trump stands accused of taking highly sensiti classified documents to Mar a Lago after leaving the White House, after which the National Archives repeatedly asked Trump to return the documents requests he ignored, and Trump continued to distort the documents in unsecured locat throughout the Mar a Lago proper including these famous photos you've seen of the boxes being stored rather insecurely in bathrooms and ballrooms and m Today's big developments Trump's attorneys ask the judge to delay that case or even throw it out altogether. Trump's team arguing two things  that the Presidential Records Act was not clear enough, so Trump did not know he was breaking the law when he brought the documents to Mar a Lago to arguing that these were his personal rec He had a right to keep special c Jack Smith's team fighting back, saying come on from clearly knew the importance of some of the classified docume he had pointing to a meeting Trump had at his Bedminster, New club in 2021. There's a recording of this meet In it, he described certain documents as classified, and he did not seem to think that they were personal. Now that's one and two. Now we turn to three. We are also awaiting a major rul that could come at any moment in Fulton County, Georgia. This has to do with the case against Donald Trump for trying to steal the Georgia electoral votes. Judge Scott McCarthy is any minu set to decide whether district attorney fining Willis, who is prosecutin Trump, should be removed from overseeing Trump's Georgia elections case. This is over claims from the Tru that Tiny Willis financially ben from a relationship she had with one of her top pros All right. Got it all. Let's start with CNN's Caitlin Polanco outside the courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida. That's where the classified docu cases. Caitlin, Judge Cannon seemed pretty skeptical of the Trump team's arguments today. She did, Jake. And what the Trump team is trying to do here in Florida in this federal case about classified records is the same thing they're trying to do everywhere  They're either trying to get the case dismissed or to make things take a really  until everyone's set to go to tr Today, they spent 5 hours in the courtr in arguments before Judge Cannon, where she didn't rule, but she did express some skepticism to these argumen Trump is making to have his case dismissed on the grounds that these were his purpose, personal papers that he wanted to take out of the White House, and that the law around national defense secrets is a little too vague for him to have known. He shouldn't have taken them out of the White House and to Ma Judge Cannon said it would be an extraordinary ste to dismiss the case on these gro and it would be difficult to see her doing that at this ju But he's asked, by my count, nine different ways to have this case dismissed. This was arguments for just two of those nine topics or approaches his team ha So we now wait for Judge Cannon  She is very likely to write some potentially lengthy about the Presidential Records Act, about the law in this case and how it is charged against Donald Trump. She says it will be coming promptly, but we still don't even have a trial date. The last time we was we were here two weeks ago. That was what they were talking about then and still nothing on the books. So I'm not becoming a connoisseu of these Donald Trump courtroom  If we can put the one up of him glowering, looking toward there. That's it. It's good. It's a it's a pretty good one. I like the shading. It's not cartoony. Kind of captu He was inside the courtroom toda We see these images. What was his behavior like? Well, take the glowering Donald Trump that you saw in the arraignments that type of criminal defendant in that posture of the former pr That's not what he is like now. He's been in Judge Cannon's courtroom for hours at  And so you can tell that he is getting much more com sitting there at the defense tab from our producers and reporters inside the courtro We're able to watch every moment He spent some time chatting with his attorney. He had reactions to some of the  that people were making, you kno little facial expressions, things like that. One thing in this case that is really interesting to watch is what people refer to Trump in the courtroom. There's not any interaction with directly in a day like this where it's about legal arguments And so Judge Cannon throughout the day was referring to him as the defendant, whereas his own lawyers are referring to him as the pres All right, Caitlin Lance in Florida, thanks so much With us now, CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid and CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig and former principal deputy Assistant Attorney Genera Tom Dupree. Thanks to one and all for being  And let's start, I think, with Judge Cannon, Righ That's, I think, the most intere What do you think she is thinkin when it comes to possibly throwing out this case? It's pretty clear that she's not going to throw out this case. But we knew that before today's  because this argument that this should be thrown out, it's undercut by former President Trump's own statements. Remember, he's had this evolving explanation for how he should be allowed to have these classified documen He had a standing order. He declassified them with his mi He's also on tape, a central piece of evidence in t acknowledging that he couldn't declassify them when he was no longer president and he shouldn't have. We knew he had secrets. But even though he's unlikely to win on the merits, the fact that she allowed argume here took a whole day to hear th when she could have just dispensed with this on paper. That is significant because every day, every filing, every motion helps delay this. And we know that is the crux instead of 100 times the Trump defense strategy. So she may hand him a loss in this battle, but in some ways she's helping win the war. So there was an argument, Tom, that's kind of like the unfrozen lawyer argument, which is just like I'm just a hu you know, caveman. I don't understand your presidential records act, r I mean, like, he was so confused It's written so vaguely. Is there anything to that? In my opinion, no, Jake. Look, the fact is, is that this law and the other l the Espionage Act that is charge under have been on the books for a long time. And although it's not impossible for a federal judge to basically invalidate a statute on the theory that it is too vague to be enfor that happens very, very rarely. I cannot imagine her doing that  particularly because the preside I mean, look, he's not a lawyer, but he's a sophisticated person. He worked in the White House. Obviously, he's well aware of the ways the federal government. And I just don't think it's going to be plausible to the jud for him to say I had no idea that what I was do could possibly be deemed illegal Now, an interesting moment today Trump's team today argued that Robert her, the special counsel who investigated Joe Biden's mishandling of classified inform that that report helps them. How so? And do you buy it? Yes. So let me translate this over into the legal world. I'm not buying the argument. Let me get it right up front. The argument is something called selective prosecution, where a defendant can raise a de It's very, very rare to succeed  I would say nationwide, the success rate is close to zero on this. But if you can show somebody els did essentially the same thing I That person was not prosecuted and I am being prosecuted. And it's for a bad reason. You can get a case thrown out. And Donald Trump's lawyers, of course, are saying, well, look at the her report. Both guys knowingly to some exte classified documents. Biden's not charged. I am charged, hence selective prosecution. But the response from prosecutor and I think the better argument  there are very big differences h This is not similar enough to warrant dismissal, starting with the fact that Trump obstructed Biden. Mostly cooperate at different quantities of docum different conduct overall. So I think the judge is going to reject that argument. But I will say that her report does give Trump's team some basis to make that argument I don't think it will succeed. Although we should note also that the her report, for all the hand-wringing Democrats are doing about how he describes Biden is aged,  there's also a whole section where he talks about what Trump did is so much worse, and here's why. It's almost as if Robert, who was anticipating that argume I mean, again, almost. As if it. Almost as if. So let's talk about the decision We just heard this bombshell filing in the Manhattan D.A. hush money case against Trump. This is about Trump hiding payments to Stormy Daniels to hide their alleged affair before the election of 2016. The trial was set to start in tw We all scheduled our spring breaks arou And now the district attorney's open to a delay. Yes. So the defense had asked for a 9 delay to go through some discove And the surprise was that the prosecutor said they wouldn't be opposed to a 30 day delay. Now it'll be up to the judge. So this judge could come back and say 30 days, 45 days, I'll give you 90 days. But what's astonishing to me, Jake, is this is the one case that was on the calendar. The other three criminal prosecutions are in lim And even if he delays it 45 days, let's say, there is nothing that would requ to say absolutely this will go. You can always come back and delay it again every week, every filing, every little delay makes it possible. This may not go before the elect So this was a real shocker. So I said the other day that a lot of legal experts consider this the weakest of the prosecutions. And I think some people in the AG's office objected to that What's your take on this decisio And what's your take on how strong a case this is? So it definitely is the least serious conduct of the four. I mean, two of the other ones relate to the effort to steal the 2020 election. And the third relates to classified documents. So I don't think there's any que this is the least serious. That said, it's still a serious allegation. It might be the only one that could realistically go to trial before the election. And it is a virtual certainty no now that both parties, when the defendant says we need 90 more days and the prosecutors even say we  at least 30, it's going to get m at least 30 days. And then it's all sort of a slip slope downhill. I mean, it gets  Think about it like when if you have an air, a flight on an airline, it gets delayed 20 minutes, then it gets delayed another 45  Right. I know. The feeling. We've all. Been there. Right. Start calling other. Airl Exactly. And it's incremental and it's not all at once. It just slides and it slides aga and it slides again. And next thing you know, it's a four hour delay. It feels like we're going down t even with this Manhattan D.A. case, which seemed like the most All right. So district attorney brag, I hope that that was a better answer than my. Now you're going to. Get taxed.  We're both going to get it. Well, I like either way. I'm not a lawyer. Ellie, is what do you make of the sliding of this case? I mean, this was the one that was supposed to go to trial before the election. It was. But the fact that it's getting b doesn't surprise me at all. Trial dates are notoriously flui That's true for civil cases. That's true for criminal prosecu And it doesn't surprise me, especially just given the gravity of what's at stake h I mean, for goodness sake, a former president, the United States is going on tr And I think both the prosecutors and the judge are going to take the extra step go the extra mile to ensure that he has ample time to prepare his defense. That's what caused the delay tod The prosecutors acknowledge that the former president had gotten more documents and they wanted to play it safe. They didn't want to create the possibility of reversible error on appeal. So they agreed to give the former president suf time to look at these new docume and formulate his defense. So I do think it's surprising. But in the grand scheme of thing this does happen pretty often.",
    "Right now, a 2024 split screen is playing out, and it's one we're going to see a lot of here in the coming months. On one side, President Biden set to campaign in an absolutely critical swing state, Michigan. Then on the other side, former President Trump in a federal courtroom for a critical hearing in his classified documents case. Trump is trying to get those charges tossed, but so far, the judge has expressed skepticism about some of his lawyers arguments. The prosecution has also used the former president's own words against him. We have full team coverage with CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paul Reed, CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez. And at the courthouse, CNN senior crime and justice reporter Caitlin Poland. Let's start there outside the courthouse. Caitlin, what is the latest out of this hearing? Well, Boris and Brianna, this was a big, bold argument that Donald Trump's lawyers have been making in court, especially this afternoon, trying to tell the judge he had a lot of ability to claim the classified documents at the end of his presidency were personal, and that's the reason he took them to Mar a Lago. He should not be prosecuted for a crime. Judge Eileen Cannon already is expressing skepticism at that argument and an argument they made earlier today that the law is too vague around national security records. Just now, just a few moments ago, she told Trump's lawyers it's difficult to see how this gets you to the dismissal of an indictment. She also pointed out that perhaps some of the things that Donald Trump's lawyers are arguing today are the sort of things that you would have as a defense at trial, saying he didn't know he was taking the documents, he didn't willfully want to break the law in this situation. That might be a question for a jury. That's what the judge has been signaling, signaling so far. She also has said in court today that perhaps this Presidential Records act pushed back that Trump's team is making, saying that Trump should have so much latitude here to decide the records of his judge can and seems to be saying that that would allow future presidents to clearly say that a document is theirs when it's clearly the federal government. That does not seem to be an argument that she's buying. The Justice Department has been making that to her as well, saying that these records that Trump had after the presidency at Mar a Lago are so sensitive that it put national security at risk. And they're the type of records that should never have been out of the hands and control of the security of the federal government for us. And Brianna. And Caitlin, walk us through how prosecutors tried to undercut Trump's argument by actually quoting him. They did earlier this morning in the arguments. One of the things that Prosecutor Jay Bratton brought up was what Trump was saying in Bedminster, New Jersey, after he left the presidency to people who didn't have the ability to look at classified documents when he referred to and held up, waved around a piece of paper that was an apparent military plan from his time in government. Prosecutor Jay Bret read from that transcript. When Trump acknowledged that the record was classified and says to the crowd in front of him, he wishes he could have declassified it and shared it more publicly, but he can't. Prosecutor Jay Brat said in court today that that is the sort of thing that would show you. He knew these weren't personal records. He also knew the law. And so these arguments that the Trump team is making today should not be able to get the case tossed. We're still going to wait to see what else the judge has to say. It's very likely she'll write some lengthy opinion on these motions and other motions Trump has made in court to try and get the case out from from this courthouse. But we will see if she says anything more today that indicates which way she's leaning. All right. We'll be looking for that. We know you'll be following it. Caitlin and Paula, obviously Trump's words have played such a key role in so many cases. From Jean Carroll, the case there, the Georgia election subversion case with the find the votes call. What about The factor? It's going to be in this case. It's such a big factor. That tape, that audio recording is such a critical piece of evidence. We broke the story that that tape existed. And I remember talking to lawyers who were on his team at the time. They only found out that tape existed pretty late in the investigation because of witnesses who had gone into the grand jury. And I remember them telling me they existence of that tape changed the way they viewed the legal jeopardy that their client was facing. Because remember, at the time, he had all these varying explanations for declassifying, that he had a standing order to declassify things, that he could declassify things with his mind. But this recording undercuts all of that. It also is the judge is is, as you know, has to weigh now, really undercuts these arguments as well. So it is a critical piece of evidence. And Evan, what are the implications of this argument that Trump deemed these personal matters? When you look at what was actually among these boxes, these are sensitive documents, right? I mean, we're talking about nuclear secrets. We're talking about the US vulnerable vulnerabilities to a foreign attack. What are the what are the things that the US would do in response to that? And as Paula just pointed out, I mean, you know, that tape makes clear that he knows that these defense programs, he's very sensitive. The defense programs were still classified and that he had not actually done some kind of blanket declassification order. And by the way, I mean, you know, the idea of the limit of a president to be able to declassify things, you know, it's not been tested, really. And so, you know, until that tape emerged there, there was some question as to whether what is you know, whether he had that power and what is the limit of that power? You know, I think members of Congress and certainly in the Senate have said you can't just declassified nuclear secrets. It's not like that because it because of the way the government works. So the implications are huge if this judge sides with him on this. Can you talk a little bit, Evan, about what the judge is saying here, that the arguments the Trump lawyers are making, that it's premature? This is something that I mean, she she's leaning against them. Clearly what she's saying. Explain why and where that leaves Trump. Well. Well, you know, first of all, it what it what it does is it sort of puts this on to a jury to make that decision. She's saying, look, this is not for me to to make that decision. And, you know, to be honest, I mean, I'm kind of surprised that we're even having this hearing. She could have had these things briefed and then she could have made a ruling and said this is something for for a jury. But, you know, she's having this hearing where the former president doesn't have to even be there. He's choosing to do this. He also could be campaigning in Michigan if he wanted to. But, you know, she's giving him this opportunity. Every one of these hearings helps him delay this whole process. And so I think what she's saying is a jury will have to make that that that argument will make that decision. And this is an argument for you to present to the jury. Yeah. She she actually said to Trump's attorneys, quote, It's difficult to see how this gets you to the dismissal of an indictment using the Presidential Records Act, shortened essentially to do right as an argument. What do you make of her seeming to oppose this motion? I think they knew that. But really, the number one priority right now is to delay these cases until after this case and the other a federal case until after the election. Because if he is reelected, he can make both of these federal cases go away. He cannot, as attorney general, dismiss the special counsel and the cases. So really, their number one priority right now is delay. So even if she's willing to hear the arguments, they know they're unlikely to prevail on the merits. That, for them is a win, because every day, every motion, every filing that helps them push this back, possibly until after the election.",
    "As a lifelong supporter of Israel, it has become clear to me the Netanyahu coalition no longer fits the needs of Israel after October 7th. The world has changed radically since then and the Israeli people are being stifled right now by a governing vision that is stuck in the past. Nobody expects Prime Minister Netanyahu to do the things that must be done to break the cycle of violence, to preserve Israel's credibility on the world stage, and to work towards a two state solution. If he were to disavow ministers Smotrich and Ben-gvir and kick them out of his government, a governing coalition, that would be a real meaningful step forward. But regrettably, there's no reason to believe Prime Minister Netanyahu would do that. He won't disavow ministers Smotrich and Ben-gvir and their calls for Israelis to drive Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank. He won't commit to a military operation in Rafah that prioritizes protecting civilian life. He won't engage responsibly in discussions about a day after plan for Gaza and a long term and a longer term pathway to peace. Hamas and the Palestinians who support and tolerate their evil ways radical right wing Israelis in government and society. President Abbas. Prime Minister Netanyahu. These are the four obstacles to peace. And if we fail to overcome them, then Israel and the West Bank and Gaza will be trapped in the same violent state of affairs they've experienced for the last 75 years. These obstacles are not the same in their culpability for the present state of affairs, But arguing over which is the worst stymies our ability to achieve peace. Given the complexity and gravity of this undertaking, many different groups, many different groups have a responsibility to see it through. The Palestinian people must reject Hamas and the extremism in their midst. They know better than anybody how Hamas's use them as pawns, how Hamas has tortured and punished Palestinians who seek peace. Quite frankly, I haven't heard enough Palestinian leaders express anguish about Hamas and other extreme elements of Palestinian society. I implore them to speak up now, even when it may be hardest, because that is the only true way to honor the lives of all those lost. By transcending the enmity and bloodshed and working together in good faith for a better future, once Hamas is deprived of power, the Palestinians will be much freer to choose a government they want and deserve, with the prospect of a real two state solution on the table and for the first time, genuine statehood for the Palestinian people. I believe they will be far more likely to support more mainstream leaders committed to peace. I think the same is true for the Israeli people. Call me an optimist, but I believe that if the Israeli public is presented with a path to a two state solution that offers a chance at lasting peace and coexistence, then most mainstream Israelis will moderate their views and support it. Part of that moderation must include rejecting right wing zealots like ministers Smotrich and Ben-gvir and the extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank. These people do not represent a majority of the Israeli public. Yet under Prime Minister Netanyahu's watch, they have had far too much influence. All sides must reject from river to the sea thinking. And I believe they will. If the prospects for peace and a two state solution are real beyond the Israeli and Palestinian people in their leaders, there are others who bear a serious responsibility to work towards a two state solution. Without them, it cannot succeed. Middle Eastern powers like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, other mainstream Arab states can have immense power and influence with the Palestinians working with the United States. They must responsibly deploy their clout, their money and their diplomacy to support a new demilitarized Palestinian state that rejects terror and violence. I believe they have the leverage to do this with the support of the majority of the Palestinian people who want, when any other people want peace, security, prosperity. I believe there is enough strength in the Arab world to get President Abbas to step down and to support a gradual succession plan for responsible Palestinian leaders to take his place. Hamas has so wrecked society in Gaza that it will take outside involvement of Arab countries to help rebuild something better and more sustainable. It may take some time to identify such leaders, but with the considerable resources of the Arab world backing them, I believe these leaders can and will emerge knowing that they have support. The outlines of the deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel that were reported before October seven still make a great deal of sense and can be the catalyst for the creation of a viability viable Palestinian state. Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations should continue to pursue normalization with Israel and this should be the foundation of a grand bargain in the Middle East that will finally make meaningful Palestinian statehood a reality. For our part, the United States, the world superpower, must work together with our allies to bring our immense diplomatic and financial power to bear on this situation. We can be a partner to the grant, to a grand bargain in the Middle East by deepening our relationship with the Saudis and other Arab nations to induce them to make a deal, but only if they actively guide Palestinians to a more peaceful future. On the Israeli side, the US government should demand that Israel conduct itself with a future two state solution in mind. We should not be forced into a position of unequivocally supporting the actions of an Israeli government that include bigots who reject the idea of a Palestinian state. Israel is a democracy. Five months into this conflict, it is clear that Israelis need to take stock of the situation and ask Must we change course at this critical juncture? I believe a new election is the only way to allow for a healthy and open decision making process about the future of Israel. At a time when so many Israelis have lost their confidence in the vision and direction of their government, I also believe a majority of the Israeli public will recognize the need for change. And I believe that holding a new election once the war starts to wind down would give Israelis an opportunity to express their vision for the postwar future. Of course, the United States cannot dictate the outcome of the like of an election, nor should we try. That is for the Israeli public to decide. A public that I believe understands better than anybody that Israel cannot hope to succeed as a pariah opposed by the rest of the world as a democracy. Israel has the right to choose its own leaders, and we should let the chips fall where they may. But the important thing is that Israelis are given a choice. There needs to be a fresh debate about the future of Israel after October 7th. In my opinion, that is best accomplished by holding an election now. If President and Prime Minister Netanyahu's current coalition remains in power after the war begins to wind down and continues to pursue dangerous and inflammatory policies that test existing US standards for resistance, then the United States will have no choice but to play a more active role in shaping Israeli policy by using our leverage to change the present course. The United States bond with Israel is unbreakable, but if extremists continue to unduly influence Israeli policy, then the administration should use the tools at its disposal to make sure our support for Israel is aligned with our broader goal of achieving long term peace and stability in the region. I believe this would make a lasting two states two state solution more likely. Now, I know that there are many on both sides who question how we can discuss peace at a moment like this. So many Gazans are displaced from their homes and struggling to meet their most basic needs. Many are still burying and mourning their dead. Entire families have been wiped out. In Israel, everyone knows someone who's been killed, who was killed on October 7th. So many Israelis feel that people around the world have no respect for the grief and rage unleashed by Hamas's vicious attack. So is there real hope for peace and a two state solution in the face of this atrocity? Who could blame even the most hopeful among us for hardening their hearts, for giving up on the possibility of peace, for giving in to the hate? I seek my inspiration in the example of leaders who've come before us and worked for peace in the face of extreme circumstances. Some of Israel's greatest warriors and security experts have been staunch advocates for peace because they understand better than anybody that it's essential to Israel's security. David Ben-Gurion, Yitzhak Rabin. Ehud Barak, all of them. So at peace with the Palestinians. On the Palestinian side, we don't have to look very far back to see a model of responsible leadership. Salam Fayyad, the former prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, who was clear in his condemnation of violence against the Israelis and for Arab the Arab leaders of today, may they find inspiration in Anwar El Sadat of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan, who had the courage and vision to seek peace with Israel. Before October 7th, things were moving in the right direction. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia both were on the path to normalization with Israel and with conditions that would greatly benefit the lives of the Palestinian people. Many believe that Iran motivated Hamas to disrupt this process, and indeed there have been setbacks since October 7th. But recent talks between Arab and American leaders suggest the desire is stronger than ever now to find a path forward. Arab leaders cannot lose their stomachs for peace. Now, at this critical inflection point. They must continue to pursue the path to normalization with Israel, and the US should use all of its power to influence and bring them to the table and make them cooperate constructively. If my speaking out today has any effect, it will probably have greater influence on the Israeli and Jewish side of things. But if this conflict is is to be resolved, we need comparable Palestinian and Arab leaders to also speak responsibly to their people about the path forward to peace. Now is the time for courageous leadership after Israelis and Palestinians have experienced so much horror and loss of life. To not have something meaningful come out of this war would be doubly tragic. History will look back on what we do here. Are we prepared together to have the courage to make an all out push to bring about peace once and for all? To bring to this conflict what Dr.. Dr. Martin Luther King Junior called the fierce urgency of now to end the cycles of tragedy and pain. I have always said that when horrific things happen, some turn it, some turn inwards and let their grief consume them, while others light a candle and turn their grief into power. They were able to see hope in the darkness, in Scripture. We read about how God created the world from an infinite void that out of the greatest darkness can come the greatest light. I hope and pray that from the brutal slaying of Israelis by Hamas and the harrowing civilian toll in Gaza, that a two state solution which Jews and Palestinians can live in peace, will prevail. I know I'm not alone in this prayer. There are right now Palestinians in Gaza, some of whom are still pulling dead family members from the rubble who are defying Hamas and their murderous ideology and calling for a pathway to peace. There are right now some families of the victims of October 7th in Israel who had been calling for peace, asking their government to transcend the cycle of bloodshed and revenge. If they can find in their hearts paths to peace, peace, then surely we can also. From the ashes, may we light the candles that lead to a better future for all.",
    "This is a story about paper. Lots and lots of paper. Americans have been voting on paper for most of the country's history. But back in 2020, bizarre conspiracy theories about paper started to spread. Looking for bamboo laced ballots. Fraudulent ballots were unloaded from a South Korean plane into Arizona and it was stuffed into the box. All of that led to this five tons worth nearly $200,000 of supposedly fraud proof ballot paper. This is taxpayer dollars down the drain based on lies. It's currently lying on the floor of this warehouse in Phenix, and no one is quite sure what to do with us. Had there ever been a problem with the paper before? No. No one's ever questioned the paper. And then what happened? We're getting to 2020. There's rumors of bamboo in the paper and paper from China. And a lot of different just stories that circulated. And so it just kind of went from there and people started questioning it. As you were seeing that play out. What were you thinking? That it was nuts. Enter David Stevens. He ordered the paper. Paper itself, ballot paper. People have concerns about that. There were concerns, yes. What were those concerns? That people were making their own ballots and then interjecting them into the system. They were coming from foreign countries. Maybe we can make our paper more secure so we would know quicker or easier if it really is a valid Arizona ballot or if it is not. Do you personally believe the bamboo paper thing? I don't know much about it other than they think it came from wherever. Stevens is a top election official in Arizona's Cochise County. Coaches is home to Tombstone, but it's a place where election conspiracy theories won't seem to die in 2022. Election skeptics delayed certification of the midterm elections here. Stevens opponent in an upcoming election says he is part of the problem in coaches. Coaches has been in the headlines a lot the last few years because of elections and mostly for bad reasons. It's an uphill battle because there are people who spread disinformation about our elections. This theory that there is a problem with our paper. So it was a it was a solution in search of a problem because we've never had a problem with our ballot paper. There are all kinds of safeguards and on top of other safeguards to make sure that the wrong ballot paper doesn't cause any problems. Ron Beck Election Services takes these huge rolls of paper and turn them into millions of ballots that are used across the country, but not these two rolls of special ballots. Guard paper ordered by David Stevens using a state grant. So this is a sample of the ballot card paper. So when you shine on a black light, you get these these tube fibers that now become apparent. Additionally, there's what's called an air tagging. And it's a chemical in there that when you hold a scanner over it, it'll it'll go a missed deadline. And other bureaucratic snafu has put a halt to the so called secure paper experiment. So, I mean, it's essentially $200,000 gone to waste a little less than that. But yeah, so this sounds like a bit of a nightmare. I pretty much I want it to be over. But Adrian Font says Arizona's top election official says Stevens experiment shouldn't have started in the first place. Well, the economic cost of the conspiracy theories in Arizona are real dollars. Now, the paper that was purchased by this one county based on these conspiracy theories, that is absolutely useless. And we can't even use it. They can't use it. This is taxpayer dollars down the drain based on lies. Stevens said he is not a conspiracy theorist, but in our conversation he didn't refute any. Do you accept Biden won the last election of the election and Cochise County was fair and ballots and Trump won Cochise County. So but nationally, that's where the numbers came out. So there were there were a lot of issues, but maybe there was an explanation for. I don't know. To be fair, there's a lot of people think 2016 was rigged. Hillary Clinton still thinks she won the election. Are they election deniers? Democrats would say, well, look, our side didn't go attack the US Capitol. I wasn't there. I didn't go. We actually had some people here that went I think they they claim it was peaceful, but the facts are clear. January six was not peaceful. Hillary Clinton formally conceded to Donald Trump the morning after the election and Arizona is stuck with tons of seemingly useless paper.",

THEY'VE GIVEN DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, DIFFERENT  ANSWERS TO DIFFERENT REPORTERS  WHO HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE API TONIGHT THEY'RE REPORTING THAT THE OFFICE SAID THAT THEY WERE  REFERRING THEM TO ONE LAW TO   ME.

I  THINK THE FIRST REACTION FOR  MOST PEOPLE SEEING IT WITH JUST SAID IT WAS VERY ODD. I MEAN,   TYPICALLY IF YOU ARE A  POLITICIAN FROM A STATE OR   PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE THE  GOVERNOR, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO  PROMOTE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT  ARE NOT LOCATED IN YOUR STATE.  IT'S VERY UNUSUAL. I DON'T  THINK I'VE EVER SEEN ANYTHING  LIKE IT SO THAT WAS THE FIRST  STRAIN WHICH THING THAT JUMPED  OUT AND THEN IT'S IT'S VERY  STRANGE TO HAVE A SITTING   POLITICIAN, A GOVERNOR BEHAVING LIKE AN INSTAGRAM INFLUENCER.

IT SHOULD BE THAT  THEY BEHAVE IN A MORE ETHICAL  MANNER THAT INFLUENCERS, IF   IT'S VERY STRANGE CASE I  SHOULD NOTE THE API REPORTED  THAT THE DENTAL PRACTICE SAID   THAT ONLY GOVERNOR NOEM HAD  POSTED A VIDEO THAT'S NOT TRUE. THE DENTIST TO PERFORM THE   PROCEDURE WHOM GOVERNOR NOEM   REFERS TO IN THAT VIDEO, ALSO  POSTED IT, AND HE ALSO PROMISED TO POST A MORE IN-DEPTH VIDEO   ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE  PROCEDURE THERE'S SOME   MISINFORMATION FLOATING AROUND  FROM THIS FROM THIS TEXAS   DENTAL PRACTICE, WHAT IT'S ALSO JUST NOTABLE THAT SENTENCE, BUT IT'S ALSO NOTABLE THAT HER  OFFICE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING  ABOUT IT, AND I THINK THE ONE  THING THAT WE'VE NOTICED, THIS PATTERN OF IN DIFFERENT WAYS  HAVEN'T SEEN IT WITH ANYONE   SMILE IN RECENT WEEKS, BUT  IT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE ON   TRUMP'S VP SHORTLIST.

    "Independent presidential candidate\nRobert f Kennedy Jr. Seems to be narrowing his search\nfor a running mate. One of his prospects for vice president. New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Now CNN has learned tonight\nthat in private conversations, Rodgers has shared conspiracy theories,\nfalsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting was not real. Back in 2013,\nwhen CNN's Pamela Brown was covering the Kentucky Derby, she met Aaron Rodgers. And Brown says in conversations\nwith him, Rodgers attacked the news media, claiming\nimportant stories were being covered up. He then brought up the Sandy Hook\nshooting and said the media was intentionally ignoring. At the shooting was, he claimed, an inside\njob by the government. Now, when Brown asked for evidence, he shared conspiracy theories\nthat had been disproven. Rodgers falsely claimed to Brown\nthat there were men in Black in the woods by the school\nand asked if she thought that was odd. CNN has also spoken to another source who would like to remain anonymous\nin order to avoid harassment. They had a similar encounter\nwith Aaron Rodgers. This person said. Rodgers claimed that, quote,\nSandy Hook never happened. All those children never existed. They were all actors. Now, Rodgers\ndeclined CNN's request for comment. Bear with me now, former senior adviser\nfor the Biden 2020 campaign, Althea Johnson. Also, CNN's political commentator,\nRepublican strategist Alice Stewart. I had to tell you. Any time there is a mention of Sandy\nHook as a mommy, I just I remember my son had just been born my oldest\nand is how horrific it was and traumatizing for a new mother,\nfor a human being, for the entire nation,\nlet alone the families of those affected. Alice, when you hear this narrative\nthat seems to keep popping up, typically in political spaces,\nit's it's beyond right? The Sandy Hook tragedy was gut wrenching for all of us,\nand it's almost like it was yesterday. And I think of many presidential moments\nthroughout our lifetime of President. One of the most compelling\npresidential moments was when President Obama was speaking about\nthat in the briefing room. Fighting back tears, choking up as he was talking about\nthese children. It's a devastating tragedy, the tragedy. And we're still coming to terms with this. But to say this was some kind of an inside\njob and was not real is is disgusting\nand it shouldn't happen. It's beyond the conspiracy theory. It is an outright lie and it's an insult\nto the families involved. And I think for Aaron Rodgers\nor anyone to claim this didn't happen is disgusting and insulting. And so I think promoting that theory\nand that line of of conspiracy,\nthat we shouldn't have any part of it. I'm curious as to why he hasn't come out\nvery vocally to say, no, that's not what I said or this did not happen\nthe way it's being relayed. I was expecting that to happen. Obviously, it's his right to either\ncomment or not and on his own schedule, but it is stunning given his name is being thrown around right now\nas a potential VP pick. Yeah, I mean, I have to think about who\nexactly is he trying to appeal to, Right? Who is RFK trying to appeal\nto? There is that's the question. This faction of, I'll be honest,\nthe Republican Party that believes in a lot of these conspiracy\ntheories, that listens to the Joe Reagans of the world, the Joe Rogan's of the world,\nwho tout these types of conspiracies. And it's interesting because third party candidates,\nas we know, aren't helpful to Democrats. But the path that RFK is going down with\nand Aaron Rodgers seems to appeal\nto a segment of the Republican Party base. And I'm also frustrated and troubled. I actually agree with you\non the troubling comment from graduating. I have. I actually grew because I do agree with you. You know, Alison, I don't always agree on a lot of things,\nbut I agree with you on how sick and vile it is for him to spout these\nconspiracy theories. I'm frustrated\nbecause at a time we know that gun violence is the leading killer of children\nin this country, Right. When we should be having conversations\naround gun control. Here is someone who was potentially a running mate, which that in itself\nI can't take too seriously. But as a potential running mate that is talking about these conspiracy\ntheories and and minimizing the impact that this is having on families\nevery day in this country. He's one of the names mentioned. Another person is Jessie the Body Ventura\nwho you know, I'm from Minnesota. He was the governor. And, you know,\npeople can look down the nose for only so long\nuntil all of a sudden you're calling him governor and you've got people\nlike Tulsi Gabbard on this list excuse me, Senator Rand Paul,\npossibly Andrew Yang. Now, we don't know\nthe extent of these conversations that they're happening or who's taking it\nseriously as the recipient of a request. But I'll tell you what, the polling here,\nhe is consistently polling at 15% nationally. He is not going to be able\nto get a majority, obviously\nwin the presidency on that alone. But do you think he presents a threat\nfor either candidate in this rematch, Biden or Trump? He certainly does. And look, those numbers are consistent\nacross the board. That's not a snapshot in time.\nThat is a trend. And this is in the key\nbattleground states. He's also polling very well. Look, if I were to be a betting woman\nwill come back at the end of the month, my money would be on someone more like\nTulsi Gabbard, who is a lot less toxic and polarizing in many regards. Look,\nI attended one of RFK Junior's events. I did a magazine article on him. His crowd is across the board black,\nwhite, young, all Republican, Democrat. He is going to pull from both sides\nand the issues that he focuses on, that he's talked about, that he's\npromoting, talks a lot about homelessness. He talks about restoring the middle class. He talks about ending chronic disease. He talks about unraveling the war machine and getting corporate government\ncorporations out of government. Those are issues that resonate\nwith a lot of people. And he is out there making his case\nday after day. And I'll tell you what, this Aaron Rodgers\nand Jesse Ventura stuff is crazy, but from RFK Junior standpoint, this is\nearned media and this is what you do. If you're not getting news,\nyou're not making headlines, you generate\nsomething that will get people talking. We're talking about this tonight. And I'm my money is not on Aaron Rodgers,\nbut it is on the fact that they're using this as an opportunity to generate\nearned media and get his name out there. And we'll wait to see who he names\nas his V.P.. Maybe the quick last word, Olympia. You know that extremism, though,\nthat he continues to paint out here. I hear you, that he has different\nfolks at his at his rallies. But we are in a primary\nwhere folks are saying, well, actually we're out of the primary, but we're in an election\nwhere folks are saying they want some new energy\nand so they're listening to ideas. But as I continue to listen to RFK,\nthey hear the extremism, right? They hear the extremism on issues\nthat they care about, particularly around health care. Him being a huge anti-vaxxer\nI think is a concern for a lot of voters. They're going to see a lot of issues\nthat he continues to talk about. And I think as voters\ncontinue to get to know him, I don't think he would hurt Democrats\nas much as people think he would. I think he actually could pull\nfrom the Republican Party. Well,\nwe shall see. Ladies, thank you both.",

HE SAID TO WIN BY A LANDSLIDE   >> GLOOM THAT   >> THE MAIN GOAL IS TO, IF NOT, DISRUPT THE PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTIONS IN RUSSIA. HE SAID,  THEN AT LEAST TO SOMEHOW  INTERFERE IN THE NORMAL PROCESS THIS OF EXPRESSING THE WILL OF  CITIZENS AHEAD OF THAT VOTE.  AND AFTER THE DEATH AND BURIAL  OF OPPOSITION LEADER ALEXEY  NAVALNY, NAVALNY SUPPORTERS SAY THE KREMLIN'S CRACKDOWN IS   ESCALATING.

LET'S GO ON AND AARON   LITHUANIAN INTELLIGENCE ALSO  SAY THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS   ATTACK ON LEONID VOLKOV WAS  ORGANIZED AND ORCHESTRATED BY  THE RUSSIANS. THEY BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE GOALS OF THAT  OPERATION MAY HAVE BEEN TO STOP THE RUSSIAN OPPOSITION IN   LITHUANIA FROM CONDUCTING  OPERATIONS THAT THEY CALL THE   UNDEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS COMING  UP IN RUSSIA.

SO LOOK THE US, THE   CONTEXT OF THESE NUCLEAR   THREATS IS THE LATEST US  INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT, WHICH  WE'VE SEEN. YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY  SEEN UP IN MUCH, IN MUCH MORE  DETAIL IN A CLASSIFIED SENSE.  BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS A  REPORT ASSESSING THAT PUTIN  COULD USE NUKES DUE TO AN  INABILITY TO ACHIEVE THE  DECISIVE WINS HE NEEDS IN THE  UKRAINE. BUT THAT IS, THAT IS   VERY MUCH ON THE TABLE.   >> ARE YOU MORE   >> CONCERNED NOW THAT PUTIN  COULD CROSS THAT LINE?  >> I'M LESS CONCERNED NOW. AND THE REASON I'M LESS CONCERNED  IS THAT FIRST OF ALL, I THINK I THINK COLLECTIVELY THE  GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT HE  WOULD NOT USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS  UNLESS HE THOUGHT THAT HIS OWN  SURVIVAL, HIS OWN PERSONAL  SURVIVAL, AND HIS REGIME   SURVIVAL WAS AT STAKE. AND  WE'RE OBVIOUSLY A LONG WAY FROM THERE. YEAH.   >> YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF  REASONS WHY HE MAY BE DOING  WHAT HE'S DOING RIGHT NOW. OF  COURSE, THE FRENCH PRESIDENT  MACRON, WEIRDLY, A COUPLE OF  WEEKS AGO SAID THAT WE  SHOULDN'T RULE OUT NATO TROOPS ON THE GROUND.  >> THE MAN HASN'T FLEXION  COMING UP. NOT ONLY HE'S GOING TO LOSE THAT ELECTION, BUT A   PRE-ELECTION, PEOPLE SAY CRAZY  THINGS. BOTTOM LINE, WHEN HE  WAS TALKING ABOUT USING  TACTICAL NUKES IN UKRAINE. I  THINK HE GOT SOME VERY STRONG  MESSAGES FROM THE TWO COUNTRIES THAT ARE ALLOWING HIM AND HIS  ECONOMY TO SURVIVE. CHINA AND  INDIA. AND THOSE MESSAGES WERE  PRETTY CLEAR   >> SO WHEN ALEXEY NAVALNY'S  WIFE, YULIA SAYS THAT THAT  ELECTION THAT YOU MENTIONED IS  PROBABLY GOING WHEN THE   INEVITABILITY OF COURSE OF THAT THAT HE SHOULDN'T NEED NOT BE  RECOGNIZED BY THE US EVEN AS A  LEADER, DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT    >> YEAH, I DO. I MEAN, THERE'S LOTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW  IMPLICATIONS HERE AND WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS. BUT THE MAN IS A  MURDERER. THE MAN IS A  GANGSTER. THE MAN HAS VIOLATED  EVERY TENANT OF INTERNATIONAL  LAW AND THE UNITED NATIONS  CHARTER RUSSIA BEING A MEMBER  OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL IN THE  UNITED NATIONS. SO I'LL TELL  YOU WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO  AND WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT THE CONGRESS PASSED THE  SUPPLEMENTAL PACKAGE THAT  ALLOWS THE UKRAINIANS TO  CONTINUE TO FIGHT AS WELL AS  THEY HAVE UP UNTIL THE POINT   WHERE THEY STARTED RUNNING OUT  OF AMMUNITION. THAT'S FRANKLY  ON US, NOT ON THE UKRAINIAN AND SO YOU MENTIONED GANGSTER AND  THAT BRINGS ME TO WHAT FED WAS  REPORTING THAT ALEXEY  NAVALNY'S FORMER CHIEF OF  STAFF, STRUCK BY A HAMMER, TEAR   >> GASSED LAST NIGHT OUTSIDE  HIS HOME IN LITHUANIA, WAS  THERE ANY DOUBT IN YOUR MIND  WHO WAS BEHIND THAT?  >> WELL, I DON'T LIKE TO   ABSOLUTELY JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS  WITHOUT SEEING THE EVIDENCE,   BUT COME ON THE ONLY QUESTION  IS HOW IS IT THAT HE AVOIDED  FALLING OUT OF A SEVEN STORY  WINDOW   >> THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN  WORSE   >> AND   >> OBVIOUSLY IN GREAT  SERIOUSNESS, OF COURSE, COULD  BE IN THE FUTURE. I MEAN, WE  SEE THIS HAPPEN AGAIN AND   AGAIN. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT  TWO OTHER THINGS. FIRST, THE  VOTE TODAY ON TIKTOK, IT'S   SIGNIFICANT HOUSE  OVERWHELMINGLY BIPARTISAN AND   352 TO 65. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'VE SEEN ANYTHING IN  THIS PARTICULAR HOUSE LIKE THAT TO BAN TIKTOK UNLESS IT'S SPUN OFF FROM ITS CHINESE PARENT  COMPANY.  >> NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT  REALLY MEANS. ONCE YOU'VE  ALREADY TECHNOLOGICALLY OWNED  SOMETHING, DOES THAT REALLY  CHANGE ANYTHING? BUT   NONETHELESS, IT WAS  SIGNIFICANT. IT WAS BIPARTISAN  BILL SUPPORTERS SAY TIKTOK IS A SERIOUS NATIONAL SECURITY  THREAT TO THE US. YOU'VE SEEN  IT BANNED AND A LOT OF STATES  FROM US AND STATE DEVICES.  >> BUT   >> AT THE TOP, DEMOCRAT ON THE  INTEL COMMITTEE, YOU VOTED  AGAINST THIS?  >> YEP. YEP. YOU VOTED AGAINST  IT. SO TELL ME WHY. YEAH. LOOK, IT'S THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE   INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. I HAVE  A PRETTY GOOD AND SPECIFIC   FIELD FOR WHAT THE CHINESE  THREAT IS. I ALSO KNOW THAT  WHILE IT IS A VERY SERIOUS JUST POTENTIAL THREAT, MEANING THEY  COULD DEMAND INFORMATION FROM  TIKTOK, PERSONAL INFORMATION,  BY THE WAY, THEY CAN BUY THAT  INFORMATION TO, THEY CAN STEAL  THAT INFORMATION THAT PRETTY I  GUESS THAT'S WHAT I WE DO   WORRY THAT MAYBE IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS THEY WOULD USE THAT   PLATFORM TO TRY TO INSERT  MESSAGES. BUT, BUT HERE'S WHY I VOTED NO. FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS  ENORMOUSLY RUSHED. SECONDLY,  WHEN YOU SAY STATES HAVE  BANDED, ONE STATE BANDED THE  UNITED STATES FEDERAL DISTRICT  COURTS AND YOU CANNOT BAN IT  THERE FIRST, THEIR FIRST   AMENDMENT IMPLICATIONS AT  STAKE. THAT'S THE STATE OF   MONTANA. SO I AM A VERY SERIOUS FIRST AMENDMENT PERSON. AND THE NOTION THAT THE UNITED STATES  AND I UNDERSTAND THE RISKS, I  REALLY DO WOULD SAY WE ARE  GOING TO BAN THIS VENUE FOR 150 MILLION AMERICANS TO EXPRESS  THEMSELVES TO HAVE POLITICAL  CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW, THERE  MAY BE A WAY TO SQUARE THAT  CIRCLE, BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN  IN A THREE-DAY LEGISLATIVE  PROCESS THAT IT WAS CONSTRICTED AND OH, BY THE WAY, REMEMBER WE TELL COUNTRIES, WE TELL  VLADIMIR PUTIN, WE TELL THEM  CHINESE, WE TELL THE IRANIANS,  YOU SHOULDN'T BE SHUTTING DOWN NEWSPAPERS, TELEVISION  STATIONS, SOCIAL MEDIA SITES,   >> SO YOU SAY YOU'RE BEING   CONSISTENT.  >> FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION REALLY MATTERS ALL RIGHT, FOR YOUR  FASHION REALLY MATTERS. I JUST  WANT TO ASK   >> YOU ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF WHAT DON LEMON WAS TALKING ABOUT,  RIGHT? HE HAD TO DEAL WITH X,  FORMERLY TWITTER, ELON MUSK   THAT WOULD HAVE AMPLIFIED  MARKETING SUPPORT, ALL THE  THINGS THAT HAPPEN WITH TUCKER  CARLSON AND ACTS. AND AFTER  THIS INTERVIEW, MUSK DIDN'T  LIKE IT. AND THAT HAS BEEN  CANCELED CONTRACT IS CANCELED.    >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?  NOT THAT SPECIFIC, BUT IF THE   POWER THAT ELON MUSK HAS OVER   WHO IS HEARD IN THIS COUNTRY  AND WHOSE VOICE IS AMPLIFIED TO A QUARTER BILLION PEOPLE EVERY  SINGLE DAY, HALF 1 BILLION   PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE WEEK.  >> THEY'LL LOOK, WE LIVE IN A  WORLD WHERE WE HAVE LOTS OF  MEDIA OUTLETS. I'M SITTING IN  ONE OF THEM RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE  FOX NEWS, WE HAVE MSNBC, BOTH  OF THEM WITH WELL-KNOWN  EDITORIAL BIASES X IS   TWITTER'S BIAS IS NOT   PREDICTABLE BECAUSE IT'S   DEPENDENT ON ELON MUSK. BUT  MORE THAN EVER BEFORE IN OUR   LIFETIMES OR ANYBODY'S  LIFETIMES, WE HAVE A CHOICE   PLEASE, OF MEDIA, SO I DON'T   NECESSARILY THINK THAT IT IS A  PROBLEM THAT THOSE DIFFERENT   MEDIA OUTLETS HAVE DIFFERENT  BIASES. IT'S UP TO US AS  CITIZENS OF A DEMOCRACY. AARON, TO BE CRITICAL CONSUMERS OF  THAT MEDIA, TO BE THOUGHTFUL  ABOUT IT. LOOK, IF WE DON'T  TAKE, THERE'S SO MUCH   CREDULITY OUT THERE.   >> THAT'S THE THING.  >> WELL TWO THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THAT. YES. I WAS IN THE CHAMBER ON JANUARY 6 AND CAME  FACE-TO-FACE WITH A LOT OF   PEOPLE WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY   CONVINCED ALL EVIDENCE TO THE  CONTRARY THAT THE ELECTION HAD  BEEN RIGGED BUT I ALSO WANT TO  BE VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE WE  CAN'T DECIDE THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS NOT CAPABLE OF MAKING THEIR OWN CHOICES. IF WE DECIDE THAT THAT WILL LEAD US TOWARD  AWAY FROM DEMOCRACY, LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY. SO THERE ARE  THINGS THAT WE CAN DO, BUT WE  JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT  AMERICANS AR",
    "Elon Musk tells Don Lemon, quote, Contract is canceled, end quote. Now, in a moment, I'm going to speak exclusively with Don Lemon and he has clips of the nearly hour and a half interview with Musk, clips like this one that we received from Don's production team. Don, The only reason I'm doing this interview is because you're on the platform and you asked for it. Otherwise I would not do this interview. So you don't think do you think that you wouldn't get in trouble or you wouldn't be criticized for these things? Besides, possibly I could care less. We're going have more clips from Lemon's interview with Musk in a moment. In a statement earlier today, Lemon writes in part, quote, There were no restrictions on the interview that he willingly agreed to. We had a good conversation. Clearly, he felt differently. His commitment to a global town square where all questions can be asked and all ideas can be shared seems not to include questions of him from people like me. Now, CNN reached out to X for their comment, and their response is, quote, We reserve the right to make decisions about our business partnerships. And after careful consideration, X decided not to enter into a commercial partnership with the show. Now, this decision coming as Musk had, of course, publicly courted Lemon and has repeatedly made a commitment to free speech when he bought Twitter again and again and again. Well, I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech where all. So, yeah, Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square. Free speech is meaningless unless you're allow people you don't like to say things you don't like. Otherwise, it's irrelevant. I really can't emphasize this enough. We must we must protect free speech. And free speech only matters. It's only relevant when it's someone you don't like saying something like It's damn annoying when someone you don't like says something you don't like. That is a sign of a healthy, functioning free speech situation again and again and again. And remember, Musk's ex has over a quarter billion daily active users. A quarter billion people on this planet. Resolve it. It use it. It is the town square. Joining me exclusively OUTFRONT is Don Lemon. Sadan, you do this 90 minute long interview with Musk. You sit down with him. This is the culmination he had actively courted you to come on one of his tweets. Have you considered doing your show on this platform? Maybe worth a try. Audience is much bigger. It had been public then. You had reached a deal. I'll talk about that later. Then he texts 24 hours after this 90 minute long interview, which is the first of your show launching. He says contract is canceled. What happened? Yeah. First of all, it's good to see you, Aaron. Thank you for having me on. That's a good question for Elon Musk. Quite frankly, what happened? I don't know. As I said in my statement, I felt really good about the interview. I said to him as we were doing the interview and it was tense at moments. But you've been involved in tense interviews. Yeah. I said to him, I think it's good that people see folks like you and I who have different world views come together and talk. As he says, I have free speech. Free speech is only important when someone you don't like or I would say someone who doesn't have your same point of view are someone is if they're allowed to speak freely and to say their point of view. Apparently that doesn't matter to Elon Musk. It's just for maybe talking points for him or rhetoric, because it doesn't seem to matter when it's about him. Questions about him from people like me. All right. So when you said that I wanted to play some of the clips because some of them are illuminating, these are clips that you shared with us. This is a part of the conversation with Musk where you ask him about hate speech. Here it is. Hate speech on the platform is up. Do you believe that X and you have some responsibility to moderate hate speech on the platform that you wouldn't have to answer these questions from reporters about the great replacement theory? Is it really? I don't have to answer this great replacement theory as it relates to Jewish people. Do you think that I don't have to answer questions from reporters on The only reason I'm doing this interview is because you're on the platform and you asked for it. Otherwise, I would not do this interview. So you don't think do you think that you wouldn't get in trouble or you wouldn't be criticized for these things? Besides, possibly I could care less illuminating in so many ways. I have to. I have two things I want to ask you about that, Don. First, the great replacement theory as you bring it up, you know, he has tweeted a tweet. He shared, Increasing illegals boost Dem voting power, causing them to recruit more. If Dems win president, House and Senate, they'll grant citizenship to all legals and America will become a permanent one party deep socialist state. Right. He has gone there directly. How much does he stand by these ideas? Well, he didn't quite seem to understand that he did originally do that with Jewish people as sort of a great replacement for everything that he did with Jewish people. And he got in trouble when he had to go to Auschwitz and answer questions and apologize and go with Ben SHAPIRO. But he doesn't understand that that sort of rhetoric that he talks about the great replacement theory and and migrant invasion, that's what radicalized shooters use in their manifestos, those exact words, the people who go and shoot up people, whether they be Latino, people who live in Texas or black people who are in a supermarket in Buffalo or Jewish people who are who are worshiping. Those people use the same rhetoric that they are, tropes that they're either racist for Latinos or black people or for Jewish people. And I wanted to know if he if he felt any responsibility as someone who has one of the largest social media and information platforms in the world, a quarter billion people. A quarter million people, I think it's 455 or 500 million users a week. And it doesn't seem that he feels that he has any responsibility with that because he seemed really averse to facts. Here's another clip. You talked about ketamine in this particular instance, something that he has discussed before. Here is you talk about your ketamine use in depression. Have you? You also have said and the reason I should say like like the reason I mentioned that the Academy had a prescription on the platform was because I thought maybe this is something that can help other people. And that's why I mentioned it. I'm not a doctor, but I would say if someone has depression issues, they should consider talking to their doctor about ketamine instead of SSRI. Right. Very civil conversation. But that is where it got very personal. Well, I got personal, but I didn't put that out there. He has spoken very freely about his use of those prescription drugs, but about his use of ketamine. I would not have brought it up if someone actually posted it. He posted it. So I would not have brought it up because that's someone's personal information. So I asked him about it. Also. It's no secret his drug use or alleged drug use, I should say, has been extensively written about it by very credible news organizations like the Wall Street Journal. And I asked him that and he said, listen, I have not read The Wall Street Journal. I don't read The Wall Street Journal. If I don't have time to read about everything that people write about me, I would never get anything done. But also remember, on Joe Rogan, he took a puff of marijuana, right? And he said it was just a joke and I only took one puff. Elon Musk is responsible for satellite. It's for StarLink. He's responsible for Tesla. He's responsible for a number of different companies on the in the stock market. And I think that it is important for people to understand his mindset, whether he's using drugs legally or not. And even even if the ones he has that he's using, that's the most powerful people. But that's what he's wanted. But the ones that he's supposed to be, that he is using prescription. Why is it that he's following the doctors orders under that? But yes, he's one of the most consequential people to the planet. And that was one reason why I was attracted to do that in this conversation, you did talk about Trump, and again, given his role as one of the most powerful people in the world running acts, who he is going to support, whether he donates the meeting that he took at Mar a Lago is a huge consequence in the context of everything that he tweets. And here's part of the conversation you had with him about Trump. You recently met with Donald Trump in Florida. What did you guys talk about? I was at a breakfast at a friend's place and Donald Trump came by. That's it. Would you discuss I've I don't of let's just say he did most of the talking. Did he ask you for money? You didn't. Are you going to loan him money to help pay his legal bills? I'm not I'm not paying in exchange legal bills in any way, shape or form. Do they ask you for a donation? No. Are you leaning towards anyone? No. You're not leaning towards his. You've been. I'm leaning leading away from Biden. You're leaning the trademark laugh there, which, by the way, in the context of the contract is canceled 24 hours after that interview. It just shows there was a lot of back and forth and give and take. What did you take away from his comments on politics? Well, he says he's not going to endorse anyone now, but he may do it later. He says he's not going to give money to anyone now, but he may do it later. You never know with him. He may be endorsing someone now on the platform. But you know what's interesting to me in all of that and all these questions that you know about what people are asking me, what I ask you on what happened, what did I do during the course of that interview? I never I never raised my voice. I told him, you know, I think this is important for people to hear, especially considering how the type of discourse that we're having in the country right now. And he supposedly says this is a public square for all. Maybe we're learning that the public square should not be privately owned by someone who doesn't think that there should be any moderation on that platform. So it was interesting because at the end, I could tell that he was upset and he was uncomfortable. It was tense. And I said, listen, I'm not trying to make you uncomfortable. As a matter of fact, I would go and have a beer and hash these things out. You and I do not disagree. You and I do not agree on much, but I will fight for your right to be able to say what you want to say. That's what freedom of speech means to me. And 24 hours later than 24 hours later, he's freedom of speech does not mean, I guess, the same thing to him as it does to me.",
    "Paula, let me go to you first. Hunter Biden is in the news\nall of a sudden. Right now, he's\ndeclining an invitation to come and appear before the House Oversight Committee. That's right. As you probably remember, late last month,\nhe testified behind closed doors before the House Oversight Committee\ntestified for about 6 hours. And when they came out of that hearing, it was clear that Republicans\ndidn't get what they had hoped from him. He was not helpful to their ongoing\nefforts to investigate the Biden family. Now, before the closed door hearing, Hunter Biden\nand his lawyers had said that they would be willing\nto do a public hearing. They said they wanted the American public to be able to hear Hunter's\nside of the story or they agreed to the behind closed door interview following that\nbehind closed door appearance. Chairman Cohen said that he believed\nthat there would be a public hearing. He said, next up, we're going to hear\nfrom Hunter Biden publicly. But now the Hunter Biden team\nhas declined an invitation for Hunter to appear alongside some other discredited\nbusiness associates. And right now, they're focused on the idea\nthat, look, if Hunter Biden is going to continue\nto face questions about this, Jared Kushner should, too, if we're going\nto talk about foreign influence peddling. Now, the Hunter Biden camp's approach is,\nall right, that's fine. If you have a hearing with Jared Kushner, Hunter Biden will show up to cause\noriginally. Hunter Biden. Correct me if I'm wrong. Hunter Biden's\nteam said they want to testify but only before the public open hearing\nand not behind closed doors. Exactly. It's been a long, winding path\nto get to any hearing at all. But it started out with an invitation\nto do a behind closed door deposition. Hunter Biden's\nteam said no, it'll only be public. But after a few high profile stunts\nby Hunter Biden and his lawyers showing up unannounced on the Hill, even showing up\nto a hearing on contempt against Hunter Biden, Well, they played hardball\nand eventually they did agree to do this behind closed doors interview with Hunter. But it was\nbecause they got some pretty good terms, including having the transcript of that interview released\npretty quickly thereafter. So Republicans couldn't spin what he said. But then there was this question,\nall right, are you ever going to do\nthe public hearing? And right now, the invitation that Hunter Biden\nhas received, again, it's not just him. It's other business associates\nwho have been discredited. That's that's going to be the panel\nthat would appear publicly. Hunter Biden said we'll pass. But if you want to do a hearing\nwith Jared Kushner and Hunter Biden, we'll be there. I don't think I don't think\nJared Kushner would show up. First of all. I don't think so. And also, he's already testified. I mean, he's there to testify. What's the purpose of having him\ntestify again if it's not for show? Yeah. We'll see what happens on that front. Lots going on. Ali, let's talk about the other\nbreaking news we're following. The judge in the George election case\nthrowing out some not all, but some of the charges against Donald\nTrump and his co-defendants. How significant is this? It's bad for the prosecution,\nbut not fatal. And any prosecutor bringing a case,\nlook, it's frustrating to have charges thrown out that you spent months working\non putting before a grand jury and so on. There's a couple things. Number one, the judge, albeit, invites\nthe prosecutors to refile these charges. They have what, a six month period\nin which they can refile the charges. And the issue here is that the indictments weren't sufficiently specific\nas to some of the counts. Right. And you can correct that. It's not like the judge found that\nthere was no possible set of circumstances under which these charges could be filed. So it's really up to the prosecutors\nto decide whether to bring these charges again. The one sort of bit of intrigue\nand interesting aspect of it is now with these six charges\ndismissed. Mark Meadows, now only has\nthe racketeering charge against him. He'd been charged with two offenses,\nthis violation of oath and racketeering,\nthe violation of oath charges now out. So there's really only one count\nthat applies to Mark Meadows in the indictment\nas it exists today. That's a significant count, though. It's a big one. That's the big one, I believe. Yeah. You know, what's your take, Larry? Well,\nthis doesn't throw out the raffensperger count. You know, former President Trump calling\nBrad Raffensperger, asking for 11,700 votes. Right. I mean, that is still contained in this. And in terms of being a violation of one's\noath, of office to have made that call. No, that's not. I mean, that's not a charge anymore. Now that now the judge is also clear\nthat all of the conduct in these in these charges that were tossed\nstill can apply to other charges. It's just this specific crime in Georgia\nof violating one's oath of office. So what would that come under then? That's the thing. It's because the oath of office in Georgia\nis pretty broad. This prosecutors didn't say what aspect\nof their oath was violated here was that, I don't know, pledging to care\nand take care and defend and protect the Georgia state constitution\nor whatever else. All prosecutors have to do,\nif they wish to proceed, is just say, we are charging you\nwith the crime of violation of your oath. Because on this date,\nthis is the way you broke the oath that you swore to\nand it would probably stand up in court. Sure. Michael, how do you see it? Well, look, Wolf,\nI think for most Americans they're principally concerned\nwith a few other things. I think the idea of Donald Trump\nin the political court cases that are pending are sort of baked\nin. For the most part. It's intrigue. It's a lot of chaos. But I think when you compare\nthat to other things, such as the economy, immigration,\nI think most viewers politically would see that as a sort of set aside. I think many Republican voters\nare going to come to the aid and rally behind the former president\nbecause they see this through the lens of sort of political prosecution,\nif you will, for independent voters. I think the president and Republicans have to articulate other important things\nunder President Biden. Sure, you have a job, but you've seen\nan erosion of your spending power. Maybe you're a younger person\ngraduating from college. You can't afford to buy your first home\nso if they can articulate that message, you sort of remove the focus\nfrom the court trials and back to some of those more tangible\nthings that really impact people's day to day lives. A really important point here is\nyou have two lawyers on the panel now who just of recovering lawyers\nwho spent 2 minutes explaining a somewhat arcane provision\nin Georgia law in an indictment. What Trump and his supporters are going to\nhear as we won today in court. They're throwing it all away. This is all junk. And it's easy to reduce this to\nSchmeichel's point to a political issue. Yes. There's an important charge\ntossed from the from the indictment. It's not it's not a huge one,\nbut it's a victory for Trump. And they can spin it as a victory,\nwhatever. Thus, he says everything is a victory. Right. Go ahead, Paula. It's also so chaotic down there, right? I mean,\nif we step aside from just the charges themselves, it's the political atmosphere\nsurrounding this case, completely unlike the other three\ncriminal prosecutions he's facing these efforts to disqualify\na phony Willis, even if they were not successful\nin removing her from the case. They have certainly tainted\nthe view of this prosecution. This is something that even the average\nAmerican voter who's not paying attention to all his legal issues, they would be like, wait a second, you had a romantic relationship\nwith the person who's overseeing this. They received\nhundreds of thousands of dollars and even as lawyers, well, we can explain\nwhy some of that may not have met the standard\nthat has been set for disqualification. There's an ick factor. And it's not just Trump, right.\nWho is on trial. In these cases. It is the integrity\nand trust of the justice system. And that's the biggest problem down\nin Georgia. It's just such a chaotic mess. And and one more thing\nto add on top of that, judge, as he's writing this opinion is up for reelection. And there's no there's we have no reason\nto suggest he's not acting in an above board proper manner,\ncalling balls and strikes as he sees them. But he's still in a political campaign\nhimself. The public just gave a public interview. And if that's the great tragedy\nin many jurisdictions in this country that you make judges run,\nI thought that was pretty extraordinary for this judge in a high profile\nsitting trial like this is doing public interviews in effect,\ncampaigning for his reelection problem. We've also seen two political challengers\npotentially to finally Willis that have come out\nand said that they're going to challenger because they now don't believe\nthat she has the best interests or the ability to really lead. And so you are seeing up to Paula's point\nand also to your point, the politicization of this, of people\nsaying, wait a minute here. If I was on my job,\nwould I still have a job if I displayed this type of behavior? I think the answer is no. Paula, there's going to be\nan interesting development tomorrow. Trump is expected to be in court.\nTell us about that. So this is for the Mar\na Lago classified documents case, the allegations\nthat he mishandle those documents and try to obstruct efforts\nto get them back. And the judge tomorrow she's going to hear arguments\nabout motions to dismiss these charges. And we don't expect that the case\nis going to be completely dismissed. But all of these cases,\nthe big question is timing right? A hearing here filing there a few days,\na few weeks. The goal of the Trump team is\nand has always been to get the two federal cases of which this is one\npushed past the election. Why do they want to get a push past\nthe election of Trump is reelected? He can make both of those cases go away. So what we're watching for tomorrow\nis we don't really expect the charges will be dismissed. We're looking for any clues as to\nwhen this case is going to go to trial. Because I was there a week or two. I lost track down in Fort Pierce\nwhen the judge was hearing arguments\nabout how far back to delay this case. What we're really watching down\nthere is when Eileen Cannon, the judge, the Trump appointed judge, puts\nthis case on the trial. So on the calendar, because, again, it's\nit's getting pretty close to the election. But I will say something\nthat was really interesting last time I was down there is the Justice\nDepartment revealed that they are open to bringing that case even\nwithin the two months before the election. That was an open question. How close to the election\nare you willing to go? Usually they don't take investigative steps that close to an election in a case\nthat could impact the outcome. But the fact that the Justice Department\nis willing to to take this case to trial maybe in September or October, that is significant, but ultimately is up\nto the judge to decide when this goes.",
    "ON THREE OIL REFINERIES. IT'S  THE SECOND DAY KYIV HAS  TARGETED RUSSIAN ENERGY SITES   >> MEANWHILE, RUSSIAN   >> PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS  WARNING THAT HIS COUNTRY IS  READY TO USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IF THREATENED. CNN SENIOR   INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT  FRED PLEITGEN IS LIVE IN   BERLIN. FRED PUTIN'S COMMENTS  WERE PART OF AN EXTENSIVE   INTERVIEW ON RUSSIAN STATE  TELEVISION THAT AIRED JUST DAYS BEFORE RUSSIANS ARE HEADING TO  THE POLLS FOR WHAT IS EXPECTED. ONCE AGAIN, A CLEAR VICTORY.  AND I SAY THAT AN AIR QUOTES  FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN, ANOTHER  SIX-YEAR TERM. HE'S MADE   NUCLEAR THREATS IN THE PAST.  WHAT, IF ANYTHING, SHOULD WE  READ INTO THESE NEW ONES   >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK  IT'S KEY WHEN HE'S MAKING THESE NUCLEAR THREATS. AND I THINK  YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO  THAT. OBVIOUSLY THIS INTERVIEW  WHICH HAPPENED JUST DAYS BEFORE THE RUSSIAN ELECTION IS SET TO  TAKE PLACE, THE MAIN DAY OF  COURSE BEING ON MARCH 17, BUT  THERE IS SOME EARLY VOTING  THAT'S ACTUALLY ALREADY GOING  ON IN SOME PLACES RIGHT NOW. SO OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO DRIVE HOME  THE MESSAGE THAT RUSSIA,  DESPITE THE FACT THAT MAYBE   THINGS AREN'T GOING AS WELL AS THEY WOULD HAVE HOPED ON THE  BATTLEFIELD INSIDE UKRAINE, OF  COURSE, THE BEGINNING OF THE  FULL-ON INVASION OF UKRAINE,  THE RUSSIANS WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS, ALL OF THIS BEING  FINISHED IN THREE DAYS. AND NOW WE'RE MORE THAN TWO YEARS ON   AND AND STILL RUSSIAN PROGRESS  IS SLOW AT BEST TO SHOW THAT  RUSSIA IS STILL A VERY STRONG  NATION. AND I THINK THAT THERE  WERE SEVERAL MESSAGES IN ALL OF THAT, DESPITE THE FACT THAT  THERE ARE ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS,  OF COURSE, FOR A LOT OF   RUSSIANS THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE  LOST PEOPLE ON THE BATTLEFIELDS IN UKRAINE THAT RUSSIA STILL  HAS THE POWER TO TAKE ON ANY   COUNTRY I'M TREATING THE   WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED   STATES AND I THINK THAT'S ONE  OF THE BIG MESSAGES FROM  VLADIMIR PUTIN IN THAT  INTERVIEW. I WANT TO LISTEN  INTO SOME OF WHAT HE HAD TO SAY I'M NOT SURE THREE OTHER OUR  TRIAD, THE NUCLEAR TRIAD.  >> IT IS MORE   >> MODERN THAN ANY OTHER TRIAD, AND IT'S ONLY US AND THE   AMERICANS WHO HAVE SUCH TRIADS  IN GENERAL, IF WE TALK ABOUT  THE CARRIERS AND NUMBERS OF   WARHEADS, WE ARE MORE OR LESS  EQUAL, BUT HOURS OR MORE MODERN EVERYBODY KNOWS IT ALL   SPECIALISTS KNOW   >> WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT THE   TRIAD, HE'S OBVIOUSLY TALKING  ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE   RUSSIANS CAN DELIVER NUCLEAR  WEAPONS ON LAND, SEA, AND IN  THE AIR. OF COURSE, THE  RUSSIANS HAVE A BIG SUBMARINE  FLEET THAT'S ABLE TO DO JUST  THAT. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN HE IS ONCE AGAIN PUTTING OUT THERE. YOU'RE   RIGHT, IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT HE'S DOING IT.  >> OF COURSE, IN ALL OF   >> THAT, ALSO, A MESSAGE TO THE UNITED STATES, URGING, OF  COURSE, THE US TO STOP HELPING  THE UKRAINIANS AND THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT ALL THIS  HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR A DIRECT  CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE US  AND RUSSIA WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN  IS SAYING THE RUSSIANS ARE  READY FOR AND CERTAINLY NUCLEAR ARMED BIANNA.  >> INTERESTING FRED, THAT ONE  THING THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN  DIDN'T DISCUSS, WHAT'S, WHAT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT RUSSIA HAS   FIRED AT TOP NUCLEAR, A TOP  NAVAL COMMANDER. THIS IS   UNUSUAL GIVEN THE FACT THAT  PUTIN SEEMS TO HOLD ONTO   LOYALTY AS OPPOSED TO  COMPETENCE. BUT WE HAVE SE   RUSSIA TAKE A NUMBER OF HITS   SPECIFICALLY IN CRIMEA AND ITS  BLACK SEA FLEET, EVEN THOUGH   THEY'RE STRUGGLING AMONG THE  UKRAINIANS ON THE EASTERN  FRONT, ON THE BATTLEFIELD. THEY DO SEEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN,  WHEN GOING AFTER RUSSIAN SHIPS  THEY DO, THEY DO. AND I THINK  ONE OF THE THINGS, FIRST OF  ALL, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN THE BLACK SEA FLEET HAS TAKEN A LOT OF HIT AND THE BLACK SEA  FEET, QUITE FRANKLY, HAS ALSO  BEEN PRETTY INEFFECTIVE SO FAR  IN THIS WAR THAT SOME OF THE  WARSHIPS THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE IN THE BLACK SEA AND SOME OF  THE SUBMARINES AS WELL HAVE  BEEN USED TO LAUNCH CRUISE   MISSILES TOWARDS UKRAINE. BUT   ASIDE FROM THAT, THERE REALLY   HASN'T BEEN MUCH EFFECT THAT  THE BLACK SEA FLEET HAS HAD.  YOU REMEMBER, IN THOSE EARLY   STAGES OF THE FULL-ON INVASION  THAT THERE WERE RUSSIAN LANDING SHIPS JUST OUTSIDE OF THE PORT  TOWN OF ODESA WERE A LOT OF  PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT A BIG  AMPHIBIOUS LANDING WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THAT AREA. AND THE  RUSSIANS REALLY NEVER MANAGED  TO PROJECT THAT POWER. IN FACT, THEY LOST SOME AREAS IN THE  BLACK SEA. LOOK FOR INSTANCE,  SNAKE ISLAND, WHICH IS AN  ISLAND OFF THE COAST OF UKRAINE THAT RUSSIA HAD HELD FOR A  WHILE. SO CERTAINLY APPEARS AS  THOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT HE  REALLY DID SACK THIS NAVAL  COMMANDER, THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN  SEEMS TO BE FED UP WITH THAT.  BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE  UKRAINIANS HAVE SAID THAT  DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE  HAVING THOSE TRUCKS COUPLES ON  THE EASTERN FRONT, THAT THEY  ARE HAVING A LOT OF SUCCESS  HITTING THE BLACK SEA FLEET AND HITTING IT WITH LOW TECH  EQUIPMENT LIKE FOR INSTANCE,   UNMANNED SEA DRONES, WHICH THEY SAY HAVE HAD A HUGE EFFECT  AGAINST RUSSIAN SHIPS AND THE  UKRAINIAN SAY THAT SO FAR  THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE OUT  AROUND MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE BLACK SEA  FLEET THAT IS OF COURSE, A HUGE NUMBER FOR THE UKRAINIANS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OUTPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE  UKRAINIANS DON'T REALLY HAVE A FUNCTIONING NAVY OF THEIR OWN  AT ALL. BIANNA YEAH, IT'S  ESTIMATED THERE TAKEN OUT ABOUT 15 SHIPS SINCE THE START OF   THIS WAR. FRED PLEITGEN. THANK  YOU   >> TIME NOW FOR THE EXCHANGE  WE'VE GOT AN EXPERT VIEW ON  PUTIN'S THREATS AND THEIR  TIMING JUST DAYS AWAY FROM WHAT WE NOTED, AN ELECTION WHERE  PUTIN IS ALL BUT GUARANTEED TO  SECURE ANOTHER SIX-YEAR TERM  AND CONTINUED DELAY IN AN   URGENTLY NEEDED $60 BILLION OUR FUNDING PACKAGE FOR UKRAINE  FROM THE US. JOINING ME NOW IS  CNN'S MILITARY ANALYST,  LIEUTENANT GENERAL MARK  HERTLING. HE'S FORMERLY THE  COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE US   ARMY EUROPE AND SEVENTH ARMY  GENERAL. ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU FIRST, LET ME GET YOU TO   RESPOND TO THESE THREATS. ONCE  AGAIN, NUCLEAR THREATS FROM  VLADIMIR PUTIN COMING JUST DAYS BEFORE HE'S EXPECTED TO THE  LOCK IN ANOTHER SIX-YEAR TERM   THERE HAD BEEN REPORTS THAT THE US WAS QUITE CONCERNED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IN TERMS OF RUSSIA POTENTIALLY USING TACTICAL  NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN UKRAINE, NOT TO SAY THERE'S NO ATTENTION TO THESE NEW THREATS, BUT HOW  WORRISOME DO YOU VIEW THEM   >> IT'S ALWAYS A   CONSIDERATION. BI IT'S IT'S   FASCINATING THAT THE RUSSIAN  MILITARY HAS JUST UNDER 6,000   NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THAT'S AS FRED JUST SAID, THE AIR, THE SEA,  AND THE LAND-BASED THAT'S MUCH MORE THAN THE UNITED STATES HAS BY THEMSELVES. BUT WHEN YOU  CONSIDER THE UNITED STATES,  FRANCE, AND THE UK, ALL NUCLEAR NATIONS, IT'S ABOUT THE SAME.  THERE'S ABOUT PARITY RUSSIA   TENDS TO HAVE MORE OF THE  TACTICAL NUKES. AND WHEN YOU  SAY THAT, THAT'S A TOUGH THING TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE YIELD, LOW YIELD NUCLEAR   WEAPONS. BUT THERE IS STILL   DEVASTATINGLY EFFECTIVE AND   EFFICIENT ON THE BATTLEFIELD  AND BEYOND. RUSSIA HAS HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH NUCLEAR  ACCIDENTS LIKE CHERNOBYL SO  THEY KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE  ABOUT RADIATION POISONING AND  THEY SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT  HESITANT SO USE THESE KINDS OF  THREATS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE   CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH  THEM. BUT WHAT I'D SAY IS  HAVING EXERCISE AND CONDUCT  TRAINING EVENTS WITH RUSSIAN   MILITARY. THEY ALWAYS TEND TO  END THEIR EXERCISES WITH A   NUCLEAR BLAST THAT USUALLY IS  WHAT THEY CALL INDEX. ONE  SUMMER NOTHING LIKE THAT  HAPPENS. SO THEY ARE NOT LOWS  TO PUT THAT AT A FOR FINE. AND  MR. PUTIN HAS REPUTED, HAS   REPEATEDLY USED THE BLUSTER ON  NUCLEAR WEAPONS. AND YOU CAN'T I  SUCH DANGEROUS WEAPONS. AND HE  HAS SO MANY OF THEM.  >> YEAH, YOU DO HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY IN THE STATE  TELEVISION INTERVIEW THAT HE   GAVE, HE ALSO SO NOTED THAT  THERE WOULD BE SEVERE   CONSEQUENCES IF THERE WERE  WESTERN BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN  UKRAINE INVOLVED IN THIS  FIGHTING IN DESCRIBED ANY  ADDITIONAL WESTERN SUPPLIES AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE WEAPONS AS  FRUITLESS. LISTEN TO WHAT HE  SAID NO USE.   >> IF IT FORMALLY COMES TO  MILITARY CONTINGENTS OF FOREIGN STATES BEING DEPLOYED IN  UKRAINE, I AM CONFIDENT THIS  WOULD NOT CHANGE THE SITUATION  ON THE BATTLEFIELD. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. LIKEWISE, THE DELIVERY OF WESTERN  WEAPONRY TO UKRAINE FAILED TO   CHANGE ANYTHING ANOTHER POINT,  THIS MAY LEAD TO SERIOUS  GEOPOLITICAL CONSEQUENCES   >> OKAY, THE FORMER ARGUMENT  ASIDE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK  ANYONE IS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING SENDING TROOPS INTO UKRAINE  RIGHT NOW. BUT IN TERMS OF  WEAPONS DELIVERY I THINK HE'S  PROJECTING THEIR AM I WRONG  BECAUSE FROM EVERYTHING WE'VE  HEARD FROM EXPERTS, IT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TERMS  OF TRAJECTORY ON THE   BATTLEFIELD FOR UKRAINIANS IF  THEY DID GET ADDITIONAL AID, IF THEY DID GET THE $60 BILLION IS HUMBLED SUPPLEMENTAL. THAT THE  US IS STILL STALLING ON PASSING YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. BIANNA, HE IS PROJECTING AND  HE'S BLUFFING. AND HE KNOWS   HOW DEVASTATINGLY EFFECTIVE   WESTERN AID HAS BEEN FOR  UKRAINE, FOR A COUNTRY LIKE YOU CAN, UKRAINE A RELATIVELY SMALL COUNTRY TO STAND UP OVER TWO  YEARS AGAINST A RUSSIAN  OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN FUNNY   NOMINAL. FIRST OF ALL, AND PART OF THE RATIONALE BEHIND THAT IS BECAUSE UKRAINE HAS BEEN GIVEN  WEAPONS AND HE IS IN FACT  SENDING A SIGNAL NOT ONLY TO  HIS DOMESTIC AUDIENCE, BUT I   THINK THE FOREIGN AUDIENCES TO  INCLUDE SOME IN THE UNITED   STATES SAYING, HEY, DON'T SEND ANY MORE WEAPONS BECAUSE IT  DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  WELL, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS FROM A MILITARY TERRY   PERSPECTIVE, THOSE WEAPONS HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE AND THE  ABSENCE OF THOSE WEAPONS ARE   CREATING DISASTER RIGHT NOW IN  UKRAINE. SO AGAIN, I WOULD  PERSONALLY SAY TO THE US  CONGRESS, ESPECIALLY THE GOP'S PUT THE BILL ON THE FLOOR.  LET'S CONTINUE THAT FLOW OF   WEAPONS TO THE UKRAINIAN  MILITARY SO THEY CAN CONTINUE   DID THE RUSSIANS ARMY, AND  THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING. THEY HAVE BEEN DEFEATING THEM.  MAKE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.  >> YEAH. AND THE MEANTIME, THE  US HAS JUST ANNOUNCED IT WILL  BE SENDING $300 WORTH OF   WEAPONS, INCLUDING AIR DEFENSE  INTERCEPTORS, ARTILLERY ROUNDS, AND ARMOR SYSTEMS, AS WELL, AS  WELL AS OLDER VERSIONS. ATACMS. BUT GENERAL, THIS, AS YOU KNOW, IS AT BEST TO STOP GAP MEASURE  HOW MUCH TIME WOULD THIS BY THE UKRAINIANS   >> WELL, IT KEEPS THE LOGISTICS CHAIN FLOWING. BIANNA, AND  THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT  THING ON A BATTLEFIELD. SO YOU  CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE  RESUPPLIES. IT'S BEEN NOW HOW  FOR MONTHS OF A DELAY THAT'S  BROKEN THE UKRAINIAN SUPPLY  LINES JUST THIS SMATTERING  THAT'S 300 MILLION. AND   TRUTHFULLY, I HEAR A LOT OF  PUNDANTS SAY THAT'S NOT MUCH.  IT'S A DROP IN THE BUCKET.   IT'S SMALL, IT'S CERTAINLY  SMALLER THAN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN  GIVING THEM. BUT WHAT I WOULD  SUGGEST IS THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT AGAIN, AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION.  AND IT IS MOSTLY ARTILLERY   PIECES AND LONG-RANGE ROCKETS  AND AIR DEFENSE EQUIPMENT,  WHICH UKRAINE NEEDS TO SURVIVE  AND THEY'VE GOT TO KEEP THAT  SUPPLY CHAIN PUMP. AND THIS IS  A "
