        "text": "Former President Donald Trump and seven of his co-defendants in the Georgia 2020 election subversion case are seeking an immediate appeal of last week’s ruling that allowed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to remain on the sprawling racketeering case.To appeal the matter immediately – before trial – defendants must obtain Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee’s permission. If he approves the request, the Georgia Court of Appeals would decide whether to take up the matter.“Whether District Attorney Willis and her Office are permitted to continue representing the State of Georgia in prosecuting the Defendants in this action is of the utmost importance to this case, and ensuring the appellate courts have the opportunity to weigh in on these matters pre-trial is paramount,” Steve Sadow, Trump’s lead attorney in the case, wrote in a Monday court filing.Sadow noted that McAfee’s ruling on Friday “found that Willis’ actions created an appearance of impropriety and an ‘odor of mendacity’ that lingers in this case, but it nonetheless refused to dismiss the case or disqualify her.”McAfee ruled that Willis can continue to prosecute Trump and his co-defendants but forced the resignation of her top prosecutor on the case, Nathan Wade. McAfee concluded that if Willis stayed, Wade had to step down in order to dispel the “cloud of impropriety” created by their romantic relationship.Wade, who has testified that his romantic relationship with Willis is over, resigned after the ruling was issued on Friday.Willis and Wade’s relationship was thrust into the spotlight in January when co-defendant Mike Roman filed a motion to disqualify Willis over allegations of an “improper” relationship with Wade, whom she hired in 2021. Trump and his co-defendants wanted the judge to disqualify Willis’ team from the case – or throw out the charges – because of a possible conflict of interest.If the case were to be taken away from Willis’ office, it would be transferred to Georgia’s Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council for reassignment – a move that could fatally derail the complicated racketeering case depending on who took over.Trump and 14 of his allies have pleaded not guilty to all the charges in the case. Four defendants have already accepted plea deals in the case in exchange for their testimony.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect which court could potentially consider Trump’s appeal request.

        "title": "When Peter Navarro goes to prison, he’ll hear the lions roar",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro hopes to spend his next few months working in air conditioning and sleeping in a dormitory for “elderly” male inmates at a prison next to a zoo.Navarro, 74, must report to prison on Tuesday after the Supreme Court on Monday afternoon rejected his request for a last-minute reprieve.He is set to become the first former White House official ever jailed for contempt of Congress when he reports to a minimum-security federal Bureau of Prisons satellite camp in Miami.“Not only can you hear the lions … you can hear the lions roar every morning,” said Sam Mangel, Navarro’s prison consultant.“He’s nervous,” Mangel told CNN of Navarro. “Anybody, regardless of the length of their sentence, is going into an unknown world.”Mangel is part of a cottage industry in the legal world meant to help prepare well-heeled convicts and their families for time behind bars. He said he spoke with Navarro on Monday.Navarro was sentenced to four months in prison after a jury found him guilty of failing to respond to congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony in the House’s investigation of the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.Another Trump adviser, Steve Bannon, has also been sentenced to four months in prison for contempt of Congress related to the same investigation, but his prison report date is on hold as he too pursues appeals.“It’s historic, and will be to future White House aides who get subpoenaed by Congress,” Stanley Brand, a former House general counsel who now represents Navarro as one of his defense lawyers, said on Monday.Navarro is unlikely to serve the four full months of his sentence because of laws that allow for early release for federal inmates. Mangel said he expects the time served to be about 90 days.Mangel said Navarro will have to take classes and get a job inside the prison. The prison consultant has urged him to try for roles as a law library clerk or an orderly, so he can spend the next few months in the air conditioning as Miami’s weather warms.Given his age, Navarro also will ask to be in a dormitory for elderly inmates that houses about 80 men in bunk beds.“There’s no privacy in the dorm,” Mangel said. “It can be scary and intimidating. But he’s going to be perfectly safe.”Mangel said there are two additional clients of his already doing time in that prison camp – a doctor and someone engaged in politics whom he declines to name - who are planning to help Navarro “acclimate.”The federal correctional facility Navarro is headed to in Miami is one of the oldest prison camps in the country, housing fewer than 200 inmates in its aging infrastructure. The prison has a large group of inmates from Puerto Rico, because it is the closest Bureau of Prisons facility to the territory.Inside, Navarro will be able to make more than eight hours of phone calls a month and will have access to email. He’ll also be able to follow news on a few dozen TVs inside the prison – half of which air in Spanish and half in English, Mangel said.In an order Monday afternoon, Chief Justice John Roberts rejected Navarro’s attempt to stay out of prison while he challenges the conviction before the federal appeals court in Washington, DC.Roberts noted that a federal court of appeals concluded that Navarro had forfeited any challenge to the idea that, even if he was entitled to executive privilege, he could avoid appearing before Congress. Roberts said that he saw “no basis to disagree with the determination that Navarro forfeited those arguments.”Navarro’s attorneys argued that pausing a lower court’s ruling rejecting his bid to stay free is warranted when the person making the request is not a flight risk and is raising substantial legal questions, not simply seeking to delay.Instead, they argued, Navarro has appealed and “will raise a number of issues on appeal that he contends are likely to result in the reversal of his conviction, or a new trial.”Navarro said in a statement later Monday, “The partisan nature of the imprisoning of a top senior White House aide should chill the bones of every American. … If anybody thinks these partisans and politicians in robes aren’t coming for Donald Trump, they must think twice now.”Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar called Navarro’s arguments “meritless” and urged the court to deny his emergency appeal, arguing that his challenge is not likely to result in a reversal of his conviction.Navarro’s “numerous arguments fall into two main categories, neither of which is likely to result in reversal or a new trial,” Prelogar told the court. She said that Navarro’s primary claim – that a federal judge’s decision to not allow him to raise an executive privilege argument at trial was wrong – will not ultimately change the outcome of his criminal case.“Even a successful claim of privilege would not excuse applicant’s total failure to comply with the subpoena,” Prelogar wrote. “(Navarro) has forfeited contrary arguments with respect to all of those points, each of which is an independent reason to reject his claims here.”This story and headline have been updated with additional details."

        "text": "Best-selling author and life coach Tony Robbins was among the first people Robert F. Kennedy Jr. approached in late 2023 about being the independent presidential candidate’s running mate, according to a source familiar with the conversations. The source said Kennedy approached Robbins at least twice.Robbins made clear to Kennedy that he did not believe this is the right time for him to run for public office due to family and business commitments, the source added. The source also noted that in the conversations between the two men it was clear there are political differences between Robbins and Kennedy.Robbins, 64, has counseled numerous world leaders and several US presidents, including Democratic and Republican administrations. “Working across the political spectrum has always been important to him,” the source told CNN.Kennedy is expected to announce his running mate on March 26 in Oakland, California, his campaign announced last week.The presidential candidate told CNN he had “made up his mind” on his pick for vice president, selected from a short list that included NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, whom Kennedy said he had met with recently to discuss the possibility of joining his campaign.Other names on the short list included former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Republican Sen. Rand Paul and former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, a campaign spokesperson said. Kennedy told CNN he also spoke with former television host Mike Rowe and Tricia Lindsay, a civil rights attorney.Twenty-three states require Kennedy to name a vice presidential candidate to appear on the ballot, his campaign said. While Kennedy’s campaign has set a goal to qualify for the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, DC, he is currently on the ballot only in Utah. His campaign has said it has enough signatures to qualify in New Hampshire, Nevada and Hawaii — and a super PAC backing his White House bid claims it has enough to qualify in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and South Carolina.This story has been updated with additional details."

        "title": "Joe Biden promised to ‘absorb’ 2 million asylum seekers ‘in a heartbeat’ in 2019 - he now faces an immigration crisis",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "During his 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden promised a stark departure from the immigration policies of the Trump administration.He pledged a 100-day moratorium on deportations after taking office. He promised to protect sanctuary cities from federal law enforcement agencies. And he harshly criticized the Trump administration’s treatment of undocumented immigrants at the southern border, asserting that America had the capacity to “absorb people” while calling on asylum seekers to “surge” to the border“We could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million,” Biden said at one event in August 2019. “The idea that a country of 330 million people cannot absorb people who are in desperate need and who are justifiably fleeing oppression is absolutely bizarre.”An estimated 3 million migrants who have been encountered at the southern border since Biden took office in January 2021 remain in the US, according to figures flagged by the Biden administration.But the mass influx of asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border has significantly strained US immigration resources. And turned into a significant political problem for President Biden—one that former President Donald Trump is seeking to capitalize on. In a recent CNN poll, Biden’s handling of immigration garnered his lowest approval rating, with only 30% of Americans expressing approval of how he was dealing with the border.That’s led Biden to dramatically change the way he talks about the situation at the border, shifting away from the more liberal immigration positions he espoused as a presidential contender and returning to more centrist views he held as a senator and vice president.Most recently, the White House shifted its rhetoric on sanctuary cities, urging the cities to comply with law enforcement agencies regarding migrants who’ve committed a crime. And Biden has embraced a now-stalled border bill that would have significantly tightened asylum laws and included a host of other conservative agenda items.“For too long, we all know the border’s been broken,” Biden said in January in support of the bill. “It’s long past time to fix it.”In many respects, Biden’s shift aligns closely with a more longstanding position on immigration throughout his political tenure. Over decades as a US senator and in his prior presidential bids, Biden maintained more centrist positions. It was primarily in reaction to the policies of the Trump administration that Biden began adopting notably progressive stances on immigration during the 2020 presidential campaign.In a statement to CNN, a White House spokesperson reiterated the administration’s call for congressional Republicans to support the bipartisan border bill.“Absent Congressional action and as we experience historic global migration, this Administration has led the largest expansion of lawful pathways in decades, worked with partners across the region to address irregular migration, and enforced our laws.”In a sign of how important immigration is as an issue in the 2024 election, both Biden and Trump held campaign appearances at the southern border last week, with Trump traveling to Eagle Pass and Biden about 300 miles away in Brownsville, Texas.Biden directly called on Trump to support the border bill and encourage Republicans to take it up on the floors of Congress.“So, here’s what I would say to Mr. Trump: Instead of playing politics with the issue, instead of telling members of Congress to block this legislation, join me. Or I’ll join you – in telling the congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill. We can do it together. You know and I know it’s the toughest, most efficient, most effective border security bill this country’s ever seen,” said Biden. “So instead of playing politics with the issue, why don’t we just get together and get it done.”President Biden is also widely expected to touch on immigration and the crisis at the border during his State of the Union address to Congress this evening.Biden’s rhetorical shift on immigration reflects a broader pivot among Democrats. Last week, Rep. Tom Suozzi was sworn in after winning a special election to replace ousted Republican Rep. George Santos in New York.Suozzi won in part by running on a platform that included cracking down at the border despite having boasted in 2022 about “kicking ICE out of Nassau County” as a county executive. But in his special election in 2024, he ran ads touting his support for Border Patrol and securing the border.At a Democratic debate in September 2019, Biden said as president he would do “several more things.”“I would in fact make sure that there is – we immediately surge to the border all those people are seeking asylum. They deserve to be heard. That’s who we are,” Biden said.“We’re a nation that says, ‘If you wanna flee and you’re fleeing oppression, you should come,’” he added.During his 2020 presidential campaign against Donald Trump, Biden was in a much different position as illegal border crossings were significantly lower than they are today.Much of Biden’s rhetoric at the time came in response to then-President Trump’s harsh rhetoric and policies related to the border. A year before he launched his campaign, in 2018, the Trump administration unveiled a “zero tolerance” policy on illegal immigration.Under Trump, the Justice Department announced it would pursue criminal charges against every adult crossing the border unlawfully. This led to the separation of numerous families, including those with infants as young as a few months old, as children couldn’t be detained alongside their parents in federal prisons.The policies faced widespread outcry and backlash and played significantly in that year’s Democratic primary. And Biden was contending with his own record on immigration – both as vice president and a senator – where he once supported significantly harsher policies and the country saw record deportations. Those policies drew flack from those running to his left in the party’s primary.“No great country can say it’s secure without being able to secure its borders,” Biden said during a campaign stop while running for president in 2007.In the run-up to and during that campaign in 2008, Biden spoke about jailing employers who hire “illegals,” said sanctuary cities shouldn’t be allowed to violate federal law and argued a fence was needed to stop “tons” of drugs coming into the country from “corrupt Mexico.”While Biden didn’t go as far as some of his opponents in that Democratic primary, in speeches and debates he vowed to reverse Trump’s asylum policies.“‘The fact is that, look, we should not be locking people up,” Biden said at a June 2019 Democratic primary debate. “We should be making sure we change the circumstance - as we did - why they would leave in the first place. And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe until they can be heard.”“Our Statue of Liberty, not very far from here says, invites us to welcome the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to be free,” he said in a speech in July 2019. “I’ll reverse Trump’s detrimental asylum policies.”Upon taking office, Biden issued executive orders ending construction on the border wall; reversed the so-called Muslim ban, which prohibited travel from several majority-Muslim countries; directed law enforcement agencies to narrow the pool of undocumented immigrants vulnerable to arrest, detention and removal; and raised the refugee resettlement ceiling to 125,000 people.The Biden administration also reversed the so-called “Remain in Mexico” program, which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases were reviewed by US immigration courts, and ended the Trump-instituted Title 42, the public health order that allowed for the quick expulsion of migrants without hearing their asylum claims, in the spring of 2023.After Title 42 ended, the government returned to its decades-old section of the US code, known as Title 8. The Biden administration then implemented new, stricter rules that bar asylum claims for migrants who passed through another country on their way to seeking asylum in the US; those who book their appointment online are exempt."

        "title": "Supreme Court grapples with claim that New York pressured businesses to cut ties with NRA",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday wrestled with an unusual First Amendment appeal from the National Rifle Association against a New York financial regulator who persuaded banks and insurance companies to sever ties with the gun rights group.The NRA claims that Maria Vullo, the former superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, not only leaned on insurance companies to part ways with the gun lobby group but also threatened enforcement actions against those firms if they failed to comply – a point that Vullo disputes.Several members of the court seemed particularly concerned with a meeting Vullo had with Lloyd’s of London in 2018 in which the NRA claims Vullo offered to not prosecute other violations as long as the company helped with the campaign against gun groups.Vullo says her enforcement targeted an insurance product that is illegal in New York: third-party policies sold through the NRA that cover personal injury and criminal defense costs following the use of a firearm. Critics dubbed the policies “murder insurance.”Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, at one point suggested Vullo’s position would hypothetically mean that even if the superintendent had pulled “out a pistol” and held it to the heads of the companies and encouraged them to drop ties with the NRA that that would not be enough to “even allege” coercion because Vullo could argue she was simply targeting illegal insurance products.It wasn’t just the court’s conservatives who posed tough questions of Vullo. Several members of the court’s liberal wing also asked why her efforts appeared to extend beyond products that were illegal under New York law.“What she was seeking was a ban even on potentially lawful programs,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said at one point.The court’s decision later this year will test how far government regulators – liberal or conservative – may go in pressuring the companies they police to do business with controversial entities.“The worry is we don’t necessarily want to allow state governments to start using this kind of regulatory force to engage in a kind of third-party pressuring,” said Caroline Fredrickson, a Georgetown Law professor.The danger, she said, is that regulators in both red and blue states could start leaning on insurance companies and banks to drop coverage for disfavored advocacy groups or companies.“On the other hand,” Fredrickson said, “you don’t want to restrict regulators from being able to have any impact on who an insurance company … is insuring.”If other insurance companies distanced themselves from the NRA, Vullo argues, it was because they no longer wanted to do business with the group. At least some of the entities split with the NRA after the 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school that left 17 people dead.The case may turn in part on a meeting Vullo had with Lloyd’s of London in 2018 in which the NRA claims Vullo offered to not prosecute other violations as long as the company helped with the campaign against gun groups.“Government officials are free to speak their minds, but not to wield their authority to pressure others to penalize speech based on its viewpoint,” the NRA told the high court in a brief.Vullo has waved off the significance of the meeting in court papers, arguing the NRA’s allegations are not specific.Vullo served in Democratic former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration. She left the post in 2019.A US district court denied some of the NRA’s claims but allowed its First Amendment arguments to proceed against Vullo. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision, concluding that Vullo’s actions were not coercive. It also ruled that Vullo was entitled to qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that shields government officials from lawsuits in some circumstances.“Government officials cannot, for example, use their regulatory powers to coerce individuals or entities into refraining from protected speech,” US Circuit Judge Denny Chin wrote. “At the same time, however, government officials have a right – indeed, a duty – to address issues of public concern.”The NRA is relying on a 1963 Supreme Court precedent, Bantam Books v. Sullivan, that dealt with a Rhode Island commission that had threatened to refer distributors to police if they sold books deemed to be obscene. The Supreme Court held that such “informal censorship” was unconstitutional.The Supreme Court heard a related case Monday, one that implicates the White House, federal agencies and social media. There, Republican officials in two states and five social media users claim the Biden administration violated the First Amendment by trying to pressure – coerce, in their reading – platforms like Facebook and X to remove disinformation.A majority of the Supreme Court appeared deeply skeptical of arguments raised by the two states.This story and headline have been updated with additional devlopments."

        "title": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams accused of sexual assault by former NYPD aide in new lawsuit",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "A former NYPD aide is suing New York City Mayor Eric Adams, alleging he sexually assaulted her in 1993 while they both worked for the Transit Bureau when he demanded sexual acts in exchange for helping her get a promotion she was previously denied, according to a lawsuit filed Monday.The plaintiff in the lawsuit alleges that Adams, who at the time was working in the New York City Police Department’s transit division and was then with the Guardians Association, a fraternal order of the police department, used his position to proposition her.The suit follows a summons filed in New York County Supreme Court in November under the state’s Adult Survivors Act. Adams has denied the allegations and said he does not know the accuser.The plaintiff is also suing the NYPD Transit Bureau and the NYPD Guardians Association. CNN has reached out to the parties for comment.The suit alleges the plaintiff was passed over for promotions while working as an administrative aide for the Transit Bureau despite passing promotional exams and purportedly being told she was “next in line” for a promotion. She ran into Adams, who at the time was a “high-ranking member” at the fraternal organization, and told him of her issues getting a promotion, according to the lawsuit.Adams offered to drive her home and said they would talk more in depth about her issues, the lawsuit says.Rather than drive her home to Brooklyn, Adams drove her to a “remote, vacant lot,” according to the suit. It was there that Adams allegedly asked for oral sex in exchange for his help and exposed himself to her, according to the suit.“While we review the complaint, the mayor fully denies these outrageous allegations and the events described here; we expect full vindication in court,” New York City Corporation Counsel Hon. Sylvia O. Hinds-Radix said in a statement. “Additionally, in 1993, Eric Adams was one of the most prominent public opponents of the racism within the NYPD, which is why the suit’s allegations that he had any sway over promotions of civilian employees is ludicrous.”The lawsuit says the plaintiff rebuffed all of Adams’ advances, which also included him trying to force her hand to touch his genitals and masturbating in the car. He eventually dropped her off at a Manhattan subway stop and never drove her home, the suit alleges.She is suing Adams for sexual assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and is suing the City of New York and the NYPD Transit Bureau for negligence. She is also suing all defendants for gender discrimination, sexual harassment, retaliation and enabling a crime of gender-motivated violence.The plaintiff is no stranger to a courtroom: She wrote a book available for purchase online on how to file lawsuits by representing yourself in court. She writes in the description of the book that she leans on “years spent fighting” in various courtrooms from small claims all the way to the US Supreme Court.But her lawsuit against Adams was filed by a law firm.“I am proud to file this complaint on behalf of my client, a woman whose strength astonishes me,” said attorney Megan Goddard, who filed the suit Monday. “She knew that filing this lawsuit would cause her significant personal challenges but she did so nevertheless, because she believes sexual abusers must be held to account, no matter who they are. Her fearlessness and quest for justice are as inspiring as they are important.”Adams denied the claims when they first surfaced in November.“The mayor does not know who this person is,” a City Hall spokesperson told CNN in November. “If they ever met, he doesn’t recall it. But he would never do anything to physically harm another person and vigorously denies any such claim.”"

        "title": "A forceful Biden hits the road as Republicans keep focus on his age and memory",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Which Joe Biden will Americans see for the next eight months?Is it the vigorous, smiling president who tangled with Republicans in real time during the high-wire act of a nationally televised address Thursday?Or is it the “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” who a special counsel determined would be too sympathetic to prosecute for mishandling classified data and will be described in testimony this week?The thundering grandfather is hitting the road, taking his State of the Union persona to a monthlong tour of swing states in the hopes of inspiring Democrats to get involved in the election. First up, campaign rallies in the Philadelphia area on Friday and the Atlanta area on Saturday – urban centers in states Biden narrowly won in 2020. His campaign is also launching ad campaigns to target Black and Hispanic audiences as well as March Madness viewers.Meanwhile, Robert Hur, the special counsel, will be testifying on Capitol Hill about his impression of Biden’s memory lapses during the investigation into classified material (mostly in handwritten notebooks) found in Biden’s Delaware garage and elsewhere.The other recent example of a forceful Biden moment came after Hur released his report in February absolving the president of criminal wrongdoing but also revealing that investigators found his “memory was significantly limited” during interviews, with the report noting that Biden could not remember when his son died. Biden delivered a harsh rebuke at a hastily called White House news conference.It’s hard to square the wildly different impressions being pushed at voters:► If State of the Union Biden is the real deal, why have his advisers not done more to stop the doddering old man perception from festering?► If he can respond to hecklers in real time during the State of the Union address, why does he not do more interviews? He skipped the opportunity to do a nationally televised interview before the Super Bowl, for instance, and instead released a produced video about the cost of chips and ice cream on social media.► If he can gladhand on the House floor long after his speech ends, why hasn’t he been more visibly present on the campaign trail? Candidate Biden did recently discuss the possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza on the sidelines of a trip to get ice cream with the late night host Seth Meyers in New York City.► If he can deliver effective warnings about former President Donald Trump in the House chamber, why does he more frequently say these things off-camera at high dollar fundraisers?Vice President Kamala Harris would not commit Friday that Biden would take part in debates with former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. The administration will “get to that,” she told ABC News, pointing instead to the policy ideas Biden put forward in his Thursday speech – protecting democracy, lowering prescription drug costs, raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing paid family leave.“At this moment in time when we’re looking at the split screen and the fact that Donald Trump is on the other side, I think that’s an important point for the American people,” she said.Biden said his goal in the speech was to “wake up Congress.” The more important achievement may be demonstrating to the country that he is indeed awake and capable.The surprise effect of his energetic State of the Union performance has also allowed some interesting comments that might otherwise have gained more attention to slide past.Biden used the derogatory and dehumanizing term “illegal” to refer to the man accused of killing Laken Riley, the nursing student in Georgia who was found dead last month and whose case has been seized on by conservatives, many of whom wore pins bearing her name during the speech.“(Laken) Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal,” Biden said, as he called on Republicans to pass a bipartisan border deal. Note: Jose Ibarra, a Venezuelan who police say crossed the border illegally, has been accused of the crime but not convicted.His attempt to triangulate toward Republicans on their signature border issue is turning off some Democrats.“The rhetoric President Biden used tonight was dangerously close to language from Donald Trump that puts a target on the backs of Latinos everywhere,” the Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro from Texas said on X.Biden’s own administration made a show of officially ending use of the term “illegal alien” in US immigration enforcement agencies’ official communications.After the speech, on the House floor, when Biden thought he could not be heard by microphones, he was approached by Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who asked him to keep pressing Israel on allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza.Biden said he would have a “come to Jesus meeting” with Bibi, the nickname for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an incredible way to phrase any kind of meeting with the leader of the Jewish state. Plus, while that kind of candor might be exactly the sentiment a lot of Democrats concerned about Palestinians want to hear about Israel, it’s much further than Biden is willing to go in public.Speaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews, Biden declined to elaborate on the hot-mic moment.“I didn’t say that in the speech,” he said, adding: “You guys (are) eavesdropping on things.”Biden’s desire to maintain some discipline around a public message is a contrast with Trump, who thrives on saying shocking things in public, be it at a campaign rally or from outside a courtroom.The puzzle Biden and his campaign must solve is how to maintain momentum from a speech that will mostly be forgotten in the coming weeks."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Former President Donald Trump can’t find an insurance company to underwrite his bond to cover the massive judgment against him in the New York attorney general’s civil fraud case, his lawyers told a New York appeals court.Trump’s attorneys said he has approached 30 underwriters to back the bond, which is due by the end of this month.“The amount of the judgment, with interest, exceeds $464 million, and very few bonding companies will consider a bond of anything approaching that magnitude,” Trump’s lawyers wrote. (Trump himself was ordered to pay $454 million; the $464 million includes the disgorgement for his adult sons Don Jr. and Eric.)An insurance broker, Gary Giulietti, who testified for Trump during the civil fraud trial, signed an affidavit stating that securing a bond in the full amount “is a practical impossibility.”Potential underwriters are seeking cash to back the bond, not properties, according to Trump’s lawyers.Trump’s lawyers have asked the appeals court to delay posting the bond until his appeal of the case is over, arguing that the value of Trump’s properties far exceed the judgment. If the appeals court rules against him, Trump asked the court to delay his posting the bond until his appeal to New York’s highest court is heard.Trump said Monday he thought it was “practically impossible” for him to post the bond.In a post on Truth Social, he claimed the size of the bond is “unConstitutional, un-American, unprecedented, and practically impossible for ANY Company, including one as successful as mine. The Bonding Companies have never heard of such a bond, of this size, before, nor do they have the ability to post such a bond, even if they wanted to.”Last month, Trump was ordered to pay $355 million in disgorgement, or “ill-gotten gains,” by New York Judge Arthur Engoron in a civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Engoron wrote in his 93-page decision that Trump and his co-defendants – including his adult sons – were liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, finding that the defendants fraudulently inflated the value of Trump’s assets to obtain more favorable loan and insurance rates.The amount Trump owed surpassed $450 million with interest included.Trump is appealing the ruling, but in order to stop the state from enforcing the judgment, Trump has to post a bond to be held in an account pending the appellate process, which could take years to litigate.Trump posted a $91.6 million bond earlier this month as part of his appeal in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case.But Giulietti said some of the biggest underwriters have internal policies that limit them from securing a bond in excess of $100 million. None of them, he said, including some of the largest insurance companies in the world, will accept real estate – they are only comfortable taking cash or stock.Including fees and interest, he said Trump would need to come up with more than $550 million.“Over the course of my career, during which I have been directly or indirectly involved in the issuance of thousands of bonds, I have never heard of nor seen an appeal bond of this size for a private company or individual,” Giulietti said. “After substantial good-faith effort over the last several weeks, obtaining an appeal bond for the Judgment Amount of over $464 million is just not possible under these circumstances.”Alan Garten, the top legal officer of the Trump Organization, said in a sworn statement that Chubb, which underwrote Trump’s $91.6 million bond to cover the Carroll judgment, could not accept real estate to secure the civil fraud bond.Garten called the lack of underwriters to accept real estate a “major obstacle” to securing a bond.Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung blasted the size of the fraud judgment.“A bond of this size would be an abuse of the law, contradict bedrock principals of our Republic, and fundamentally undermine the rule of law in New York,” Cheung said. “President Trump will continue fighting and beating all of these Crooked Joe Biden-directed hoaxes and will Make America Great Again.”CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly spell the name of Trump’s insurance broker, Gary Giulietti.

        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday appeared deeply skeptical of arguments by two conservative states that the First Amendment bars the government from pressuring social media platforms to remove online misinformation.In more than 90 minutes of oral arguments that occasionally veered into the justices’ personal frustrations with the press, several conservative justices sided with the liberal wing in appearing to doubt claims by two states that the Biden administration violated the Constitution with the practice.Louisiana and Missouri accused the Biden administration of a sweeping censorship campaign conducted through emailed and other communications with social media platforms.In the communications, government officials routinely used expletives and other strong language to flag posts related to Covid-19 and the 2020 election that they believed violated the platforms’ terms, and demanded the posts be removed. In some cases, platforms complied with the takedown requests. Others were ignored.Whether those emails amount to censorship is a question for the court that could reshape the government’s ability to respond to election meddling, public health crises, child sexual exploitation and other pressing issues playing out in the virtual public square, the US government has said.Here’s what to know from Monday’s arguments:In a series of hypothetical questions, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett signaled concern about setting a standard that restricted the government’s ability to communicate with the platforms over content that might be problematic.Such a standard, they seemed to suggest, could be damaging.Kavanaugh noted it is “not uncommon for government officials to protest an upcoming [newspaper] story on surveillance or detention policy and say, you know, ‘If you run that, it’s going to harm the war effort and put Americans at risk.’” He asked whether the government couldn’t request the platforms to remove content that was, for instance, posed danger to American troops.In another telling exchange, Barrett pressed the states on what would happen if a social media user identified the home addresses of public officials and encouraged people to rally so that those officials could be “harmed.” The justices, of course, have had firsthand experience with similar circumstances. In the run-up to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, protesters rallied outside several of their homes for weeks.Barrett asked: Could the FBI not call the social media sites and encourage them to take such posts down?“I’m a purist on the First Amendment,” said Benjamin Aguiñaga, the attorney for the states, suggesting that that course of action would be unconstitutional. But then Aguiñaga quickly added that “the FBI absolutely can identify certain troubling situations like that for the platforms” and allow them to take action themselves without an explicit request from the government.Not all of the conservatives appeared ready to back the Biden administration.Led by Justice Samuel Alito, several raised concerns about the extent of the contact between the government agencies and the private platforms over posts they wanted stricken.In one key exchange, Alito laid out a case for how unusual it was that federal officials were pressuring the sites to remove content. Alito, among the most stalwart conservatives on the court, wondered aloud what would happen if the government had made similar requests of traditional media companies, like newspapers and cable television outlets.Alito described what the government did as a “constant pestering of Facebook.”“It’s treating Facebook and these other platforms like they’re subordinates,” Alito told Brian Fletcher, an attorney representing the Biden administration. “Would you do this to the New York Times?”Alito later added: “I cannot imagine federal officials taking that approach to the print media.”Justice Elena Kagan, one of the court’s liberal members, contradicted Alito in a different exchange.“Like Justice Kavanaugh, I’ve had some experience encouraging press to suppress their own speech,” Kagan said to chuckles in the courtroom. “This happens literally thousands of times a day in the federal government.”Alito argued that the difference between traditional and social media is that the federal government ostensibly holds the power to revoke protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that immunize the sites from lawsuits involving content moderation. In other words, Alito said, the government had “big clubs” it could use to try to coerce the social medica companies to cooperate.Fletcher pointed to the context of the communication between the Biden administration and the social media companies. “This was a time when thousands of Americans were still dying every week and there was a hope that getting everyone vaccinated could stop the pandemic,” he said.Elsewhere, Fletcher added that the Biden administration may have a bully pulpit role in shaping the debate over Section 230 but that it lacks any actual authority to weaken the law. That is Congress’ role, he said, challenging claims that the administration has issued credible threats against social media that could support a coercion argument.Some of the court’s liberal justices suggested there may be situations in which the government has an important role to play in influencing social media platforms’ handling of user speech.“Part of the reason why you might be running into all of these difficulties,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told the state’s lawyer, “is because you’re not focusing on the fact that there are times in which the government can, depending on the circumstances, encourage, perhaps even coerce, because they have a compelling interest in doing so.”Aguiñaga repeatedly sought to persuade the court to look at the overall outcome of the communications.“Regardless of the label you apply — whether it’s coercion, whether it’s encouragement, or joint participation and conspiracy — at the end of the day, if what the government is trying to do is eliminate viewpoints from public discourse,” that would be unconstitutional, he argued.But many of the justices pushed back, suggesting it is not enough to look at the outcome and that there is an important distinction between coercion and encouragement."

        "title": "‘Everything he is saying isn’t true’: Congolese governments denounce Trump’s baseless stories about emptied prisons",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "There is no evidence for former President Donald Trump’s repeated claims that “the Congo” has emptied prisons to allow violent criminals to come to the US border as migrants – and the governments of both the Democratic Republic of Congo and the neighboring Republic of Congo say Trump’s assertions are entirely false.“Everything he is saying isn’t true,” Democratic Republic of Congo spokesperson Patrick Muyaya Katembwe told CNN in a text message on Thursday. Asked specifically about Trump’s claims about Congolese prisons being emptied of violent criminals, he said, “Never ever, it’s not true.” And, he said, “we want him to stop” telling these stories, since “it’s very bad for the country.”Serge Mombouli, the Republic of Congo’s ambassador to the US, said in an email to CNN on Friday: “There is no truth or any sign nor a single fact supporting such a claim or statement.”A CNN fact check found the same.Facts First: Trump’s claims are baseless. Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo, plus both pro-immigration and anti-immigration organizations in the US, told CNN they have not seen any evidence of Congolese prisons being emptied. Trump’s presidential campaign and an allied super PAC did not respond to requests to provide any evidence. A CNN search of two media databases turned up no evidence. And federal figures show that there is no “very big” influx of Congolese migrants of any kind, let alone former prisoners in particular.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, keeps making claims about emptied Congolese prisons as he criticizes President Joe Biden’s handling of immigration. For example, Trump said during a Fox News town hall in late February: “We have people coming in from everywhere. They’re coming in from the Congo. They interviewed some people last night. ‘Where are you from?’ ‘Congo.’ ‘Where did you live?’ ‘Prison.’ They’re emptying out their prisons into our country.”During a visit to the border later in February, Trump said, “The Congo – a very big population coming in from jails from the Congo. You look at the jails now, you take a look at the jails throughout the region, but more importantly, throughout the world. They’re emptying out because they’re dumping them into the United States.”But media databases contain no corroboration for these stories. And human rights organizations that monitor the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring Republic of Congo say they know of no evidence for them.“I’ve not heard anything about emptying of Congolese prisons,” Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director for Human Rights Watch, said of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Amnesty International senior researcher Abdoulaye Diarra, who studies the Republic of Congo, told CNN in a text message on Friday: “To my knowledge and according to other Congolese organisations, there has been no mass release of prisoners from Congolese prisons” in the Republic of Congo.Even if there had been such a prisoner release, it would not prove Trump’s claim about a “very big population” of Congolese former prisoners arriving at the border. Official federal data shows that Congolese migrants in general, not ex-prisoners in particular, represent a tiny fraction of overall arrivals.In the first four months of the 2024 fiscal year, through January, there were just 320 Border Patrol encounters at the southern border with people from the Democratic Republic of Congo or Republic of Congo, according to official data provided to CNN by US Customs and Border Protection this week. That is a minuscule fraction of the more than 753,000 total Border Patrol encounters with people from around the world in those four monthsCNN also reached out to two US organizations that advocate reduced immigration levels in search of any evidence for Trump’s claims about emptied Congolese prisons, since these groups sometimes serve as sources for Trump’s rhetoric about the border. One responded: “We don’t have any information about this one way or the other,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies.And the pro-immigration Migration Policy Institute, which said it is unaware of any country emptying prisons to send people to the US, noted that Trump’s stories about “the Congo” are just the latest in his series of unsubstantiated claims about foreign countries supposedly emptying prisons and mental health facilities for nefarious migration purposes. “This week, the Congo. In the past, Latin America.Tomorrow, likely another country,” spokesperson Michelle Mittelstadt scoffed of Trump’s claims.Trump’s evolving claimsIndeed, Trump has a habit of making his false or unsubstantiated stories more dramatic or colorful over time.His claims about “the Congo” are part of a long-running series on the same theme. He has for years made baseless claims that various foreign countries are intentionally sending violent and otherwise undesirable people to the US as migrants. During his 2016 presidential campaign, for example, he made such claims about Mexico.Then, while running again in 2023, Trump repeatedly told an unsubstantiated story about mental health institutions in South America, including “insane asylums,” being deliberately emptied for nefarious migration purposes. Trump’s campaign was unable to provide any corroboration for that story, though he had repeatedly cited a supposed media report.Trump also made unproven claims in 2023 about migrants being emptied out of foreign prisons. By January 2024, he was referring specifically to migrants who had been prisoners in “the Congo.” Then, by February 2024, he was claiming that the Congolese migrants acknowledged having been incarcerated for “murder.”He has never provided a specific source for any of these remarks."

        "title": "Biden signs new executive order to improve women’s health research as reproductive health remains central to reelection pitch",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "President Joe Biden is taking new executive action Monday to improve research on women’s health across the federal government as well as announce new actions being taken by several federal agencies as the White House seeks to increase funding for women’s health research.While none of Monday’s actions are directly related to IVF research, the announcement comes as the Biden campaign has made reproductive health a focal point of his reelection campaign. Ever since Roe v. Wade was overturned, threats to abortion access and reproductive health have been animating voters critical to Democrats’ coalition.Speaking to an audience gathered in the East Room of the White House for a reception marking Women’s History Month on Monday, Biden needled the efforts of former President Donald Trump and Republican members of Congress to restrict women’s access to health care, while vowing to reinstate Roe v. Wade as the law of the land if he’s reelected with a Democratic-controlled Congress.“Our basic freedoms are under assault – the freedom to vote, freedom to choose and so much more,” Biden said. “My predecessor and his allies in Congress make no apologies for it, but here’s the deal: In the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court wrote, ‘Women are not without electoral and/or political power.’”“No kidding!” the president added.Biden’s new executive order Monday will integrate and prioritize women’s health across various federal agencies, fuel new research, and order the Office of Management and Budget and the Gender Policy Council to assess gaps in federal funding, according to the White House.In addition to the executive order, Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden will be announcing over 20 actions or commitments being taken by several federal agencies. One of those efforts highlighted by the White House include a new effort from the National Institute of Health to direct “key investments” of $200 million to fund interdisciplinary women’s health research.Biden made women’s reproductive rights a central pitch of his State of the Union address earlier this month - during which he urged Congress to pass $12 billion in new funding for women’s health research - and Vice President Kamala Harris has been traveling the country on a “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour since late January.That tour saw Harris visit a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota last week – historic because it was the first time a sitting president or vice president had visited an abortion provider.She has also made stops in California, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin.Introducing Biden on Monday, Harris warned the country is facing “a full-on attack against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, including the rights of women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.”“Today in America, one-in-three women of reproductive age live in a state with an abortion ban,” she said, adding that she’s met “women who have had miscarriages in toilets because they were refused care” since Roe was overturned.Nearly half of all registered voters in the United States say the November elections will have a “major impact” on abortion access, and 1 in 8 say the issue will be the most important driving factor motivating their vote, according to a KFF survey earlier this month.The issue as a motivating factor for voters was sharpened after the Alabama Supreme Court last month ruled that frozen embryos were children, and that those who destroyed the embryos could be held liable for wrongful death. A new law passed by Alabama lawmakers has allowed IVF treatment to continue in the state after a panicked response by providers in the wake of the court decision.The ruling caused even some of the most conservative members of Congress to move for legislation that would protect IVF, though House Speaker Mike Johnson said last week that the issue should be up to the states, not Congress.“This is a huge opportunity for transformative change and will help improve the health and lives of women all across the country,” Dr. Carolyn Mazure, the chair of the White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research, said in a call with reporters.This story has been updated with additional developments on Monday."

        "title": "Fact check: Trump, telling a completely fictional story, falsely claims he released ‘the tape’ of his Zelensky call",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Former President Donald Trump told an entirely fictional story on Saturday about how he had supposedly outwitted his Democratic opponents by releasing “the tape” of the 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that was a key factor in Trump’s first impeachment.Speaking at a Saturday campaign rally in Ohio, Trump claimed he let Democrats make “wilder and wilder” claims about what he said to Zelensky, “and then we released the tape.” Trump proceeded to claim that when Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, who was then the speaker of the House, “heard” this tape, she was angry that she had been deceived by her allies’ previous “false” descriptions of the call; he claimed that Pelosi said to “her people”: “What the hell did you get me into? You hear this call? He didn’t do any of this stuff!”Trump claimed that Pelosi was told, “Let’s just pretend he did and keep going forward.” He continued, “After they made up the story and then after that they heard the tape, they died. They didn’t know that phone call was taped. That was one good case of a phone call being taped. And they were taped and they got caught.”Facts First: Trump’s story is a complete fabrication. No tape of his call with Zelensky was ever released; Pelosi could not possibly have been angry with her allies after hearing a tape of the call because she has never heard a tape of the call. In fact, as of nearly five years after the July 2019 call, there is no known US recording of the conversation. What Trump’s White House actually released in September 2019 was a rough written transcript of the call — which corroborated, rather than contradicted, a government whistleblower’s central allegations about what Trump had said. Pelosi spokesperson Aaron Bennett said Sunday that Trump’s story is “fact-free nonsense.”Presidential phone calls with foreign leaders are not typically recorded by the American side. Instead, they are inexactly memorialized in written form by a combination of software and US officials who listen in.Retired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who was one of the officials listening to Trump’s call with Zelensky in his role at the time as the top Ukraine expert for the White House’s National Security Council (and who later became an important witness in the impeachment inquiry), told CNN in a text message on Sunday that there is “no recording” of the call.“He’s lying,” Vindman said.Trump’s new story echoes his false claims from his presidencyTrump has been trying since late 2019 to rewrite reality about the phone call with Zelensky — in which, after Zelensky spoke of Ukraine wanting to buy weapons from the US, Trump pushed him to investigate Joe Biden, who was then Trump’s looming Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential election, as well as probe a baseless conspiracy theory about supposed Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election (in which Russia interfered). The false story Trump delivered at his Saturday rally was a more dramatic version of false stories he told more than four years ago, which CNN fact-checked at the time.In the previous stories, Trump claimed that he had triumphed over a prominent figure in the impeachment effort, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, by releasing the rough transcript of the call with Zelensky after Schiff had misleadingly paraphrased what Trump had said. He claimed that Schiff never would have made his comments if he had known Trump would release the rough transcript.But that Trump claim never made any sense, either — because, in reality, he released the rough transcript before Schiff gave his exaggerated rendition of it at a congressional hearing.In Trump’s 2019 versions of the story, he claimed that Pelosi had been dismayed with her allies after she read the rough transcript, not after she listened to “the tape.” But there was no basis even for that claim; after the rough transcript was released, Pelosi issued a scathing statement accusing Trump of “lawlessness” and attempting “to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.” A Pelosi spokesperson told CNN in 2019 that Trump’s account of her supposed thoughts was “complete fiction.”Trump made numerous additional false claims at the Saturday rally in Ohio. He told the “tape” version of the story while again bashing Schiff, who is now running for a US Senate seat in California."

        "title": "Supreme Court to debate whether White House crosses First Amendment line on social media disinformation",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "For doctors like Eileen Barrett, a pending Supreme Court case challenging the government’s ability to communicate with social media companies isn’t principally a fight about the fraught politics of online speech.Instead, they say, it’s a matter of life and death.“I have seen countless statements that are at best problematic and at worst flat-out disinformation that I’m terribly fearful are causing harm to patients,” said Barrett, who chairs the board of regents of the American College of Physicians. “We’ve all taken care of somebody who has died from the flu. And now we’ve all taken care of people who have died from Covid.”Biden administration officials have for years persuaded social media platforms such as Facebook and X to take down posts that include misinformation about vaccines, the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, among other things.But the Supreme Court must now decide whether those efforts go too far – when the government, in other words, veers into censorship on social media that violates the First Amendment.The case could prove pivotal to the 2024 election. Its outcome could determine whether the Department of Homeland Security can legally flag posts to social media companies that may be the work of foreign disinformation agents seeking to disrupt the race. Blocking that line of communication would undo years of collaboration that began as a response to bombshell revelations that Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 US elections.Republican officials in two states – Missouri and Louisiana – and five social media users sued over the practice in 2022, arguing that the White House did far more than “persuade” the tech giants to take down a few deceptive posts. Instead, they say, the Biden administration engaged in an informal, backdoor campaign of coercion to silence voices it disagreed with — a practice known as “jawboning.”They say the decision by social media companies to suppress coverage of Hunter Biden’s laptop in late 2020 is evidence of the type of unconstitutional government influence they are challenging. The plaintiffs also say the FBI leaned on platforms to remove content it identified as “foreign” when the posts were actually written by Americans.“The result of this was to silence entire narratives,” said Jenin Younes, litigation counsel for the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a legal advocacy group that frequently challenges government regulations and that is representing the private plaintiffs in the case. “Policies were adopted without the public hearing those views and that’s exactly why we have a First Amendment, so the government can’t do stuff like that.”Oral arguments in the case, Murthy v. Missouri, arrive at a moment when courts and policymakers are grappling with the power of social media to influence everything from a patient’s medical decisions to the outcome of a presidential election. At times the debates around social media have prompted bipartisan responses, such as legislation approved by the House on Wednesday that could lead to a nationwide ban against TikTok.But legal fights over social media at the Supreme Court this year have taken on a partisan hue.The high court is also considering state laws approved by Florida and Texas designed to stop social media giants from throttling conservative views. Those laws are being challenged by a trade group representing social media firms that has claimed they trample over the companies’ First Amendment rights.The First Amendment bars government-imposed restrictions on free speech. That prohibition doesn’t extend to private entities like Facebook, which are free to make whatever decisions about content they choose.But the Supreme Court has ruled in past decisions that private entities can become “state actors,” and be subject to First Amendment scrutiny, when the government compels them to take action.The administration argues it did not compel platforms to do anything because, it says, it never threatened social media companies with negative consequences if they refused to heed its advice.“Government officials do not violate the First Amendment when they speak in public or in private to inform, to persuade, or to criticize speech by others,” the US government wrote in a brief.Testimony in the case by an FBI official showed that social media companies frequently made their own decisions about how to handle input from the government. In many situations, the official testified, companies flat-out ignored the government’s flags or suggestions about content that appeared to violate their own terms of service.Internal communications related to Twitter’s handling of the Hunter Biden laptop story also highlighted how high-level company officials were divided on whether to suppress coverage of the story, contrary to suggestions by some critics that social media platforms demoted it because of government pressure or their own ideological bias.“The government has no authority to threaten platforms into censoring protected speech,” said Alex Abdo with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “But it must have the ability to participate in public discourse so that it can effectively govern and inform the public of its views.”A federal judge in Louisiana who initially reviewed the case blocked the White House and a slew of federal agencies from communicating with social media companies about removing content in a sweeping preliminary injunction last year.A three-judge panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals scaled back the injunction last fall, narrowing its scope to a few agencies it said likely violated the First Amendment: the White House, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI.After the Biden administration filed an emergency appeal last year, the Supreme Court temporarily paused the injunction – in other words, allowing federal officials to continue the communications – and agreed to hear the case.Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas said they disagreed with that decision.“At this time in the history of our country, what the court has done, I fear, will be seen by some as giving the government a green light to use heavy-handed tactics to skew the presentation of views on the medium that increasingly dominates the dissemination of news,” Alito wrote. “That is most unfortunate.”The dispute has drawn interest from state and county election officials who are worried about a decision that might limit their ability to fight election disinformation. In a separate brief, media organizations warn of a “chilling of the free flow of information” if the court rules broadly for the plaintiffs. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has opposed Covid-19 vaccines and policies intended to reduce the spread of the virus, tried to intervene in the case but was denied.A ruling against the US government would threaten research and speech by independent watchdogs and discourage vital work to secure America’s elections, according to civil rights advocates.“Information sharing between and among government agencies, voting rights organizations, and social media companies is crucial in guarding against emerging threats, particularly to vulnerable communities,” a trio of prominent civil rights groups wrote in a filing.From the doctors’ perspective, the trends around vaccine hesitancy are moving in the wrong direction. Dr. Benjamin Hoffman, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, blames misinformation on social media as a big part of the reason why.The medical groups, which are supporting the Biden administration, were represented by Democracy Forward Foundation, a left-leaning legal advocacy group.“We have to deal day in and day out with the ramifications of myths and disinformation around health issues, in general, but specifically about vaccines,” said Hoffman, a practicing pediatrician in Oregon. “While our concern is not necessarily the crux of the Supreme Court case, the impact is really, really significant.”"

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Joy Rendulic was hesitant when her husband first suggested a move to South Carolina. Then she visited a small ice cream shop for sale near the spectacular coast of this barrier island town.Rendulic cashed in her 401(k) to buy it, and left Erie, Pennsylvania, behind.“God brought me here,” Rendulic told us during a break at Island Treats ice cream shop. “I thought I was doing what I was supposed to be doing for the rest of my life, and he had a different plan. We think we are in control. But we’re not.”The big move was in 2016. Nikki Haley was the governor then, and newcomer Rendulic was impressed.“Yes, she was a very good governor,” Rendulic said.Donald Trump won her vote for president that same year, again in 2020 and will once more when Trump and Haley square off in the South Carolina GOP presidential primary this month.“I totally believe that God has assigned him to this position,” Rendulic said of Trump. “That is my true belief.”We ask what happened in 2020.“That was a mess,” Rendulic said. “That was so illegal. Some improper cheating happening to the voting procedures.”We mention all the recounts and court cases Trump lost, including cases decided by judges Trump appointed, that upheld now-President Joe Biden’s victory.“I think so many people hate Trump,” she said. “I just know there was a whole lot of cheating.”There is no evidence of that, but Rendulic is adamant.So we ask, if it was God’s plan for Trump to be president, why would God let that happen?The answer is halting.“What happened is what happened. And I believe Trump is coming again.”Rendulic represents an important slice of the Trump base: for Trump no matter what. These voters echo his false claims about rigged elections and bogus investigations and they stand by Trump even when he does things counter to their priorities. You find a lot of them in South Carolina, one reason Trump consistently leads the primary polls despite Haley’s home state status.Rendulic, for example, lists abortion – or the “right to life,” as she puts it – as the reason her last vote for a Democrat for president was Jimmy Carter. But she offers no criticism of Trump when we point out he has recently criticized some state abortion restrictions as too harsh and has warned it could be a losing issue for Republicans.“I haven’t thought about that too much, probably,” Rendulic said. “I want it to be right to life.”No doubt Trump gets her vote.“He’s even more ready now and very, very intelligent, cares a lot about this country,” she said. “Wants to do what is right.”Billy Pierce is another piece of the Trump comeback puzzle.He has lived in Hartsville – about two hours inland from the South Carolina coast – all his 70 years except for a stint in the Navy.Pierce says he was drawn to Trump in 2016 for the same reason he backed Ross Perot in 1992.“I wanted a non-career politician in there that would do, would run it like a company,” Pierce said in an interview in the garage office where he organizes his part-time consulting work.Pierce sees Biden as too unwilling to stand up to the Democratic left and has fond memories of the pre-Covid economy during the Trump administration.“We didn’t have the high inflation,” he said. “We didn’t have the high interest rates.”Pierce is not an election denier. He does believe it was wrong that many states adopted new voting rules during the 2020 pandemic, but said Trump should have honored the results once all his challenges were exhausted.Nor is Pierce a fan of the former president’s toxic tone.“If he’d just shut up and, you know, got off Twitter and that kind of stuff, he’d have made a great president,” Pierce said.He called himself a likely Trump voter in the primary and described the choice between Trump and Haley as “the lesser of two evils.”But Pierce is very much in line with Trump on policy matters.“He’s going to fix the things I need him to fix,” Pierce said, listing the border as his top priority.“Shut it down,” is Pierce’s desire, though he agrees with Trump that congressional Republicans should not pass a border package before the November election – even if it would slow the flow of illegal border crossings. “This is a Democratic ploy” designed to help Biden, Pierce said.He offers a suggestion on what he would do at the border, based on his time in the military.“Have us put up razor wire,” Pierce said. “I have no problem with putting up two rows and mining the other. So if they come in, you tell them it is mined. You put signs out there that says it’s mined.”He balances such tough talk with a personal story about his daughter adopting two children from Guatemala. Be tough at the border now, Pierce said, and then conversations about more legal immigration would be possible. “It needs to be done the right way.”Craig Thomas lived in Tennessee when Trump caught his attention in 2016.Thomas describes himself as “conservative, some areas libertarian.”Trump, he thought then, was an outsider – and a vote for him would send a message to Washington.“It was like, alright, like this is good,” said Thomas. “Let’s blow some things up.”Now, Thomas lives in Charleston and is voting for Haley – to send a message to his two children.He is tired of all the personal attacks and all the anger and wants a president who is also a role model. Haley, he said, “brings very similar policy positions, but definitely without the drama.”One recent MAGA conspiracy theory hit too close to home.“I don’t think there’s any sort of a crazy conspiracy between the NFL and Taylor Swift and everything else just showing up for a Biden coronation,” Thomas said. “How do I look at my daughter, who is a huge Taylor Swift fan, and this guy just attacking Taylor Swift, just because she is going to support another candidate, right.”“And other things like that. And having those conversations with them. It does matter. And it does matter who you support.”Charleston is rich with both Revolutionary and Civil War history, a place where you can still ride a horse-drawn carriage down a cobblestone street. It is more affluent, more educated and less Trumpy than most of South Carolina.“But there is quite a bit of talk about Trump, even here,” Thomas said.Mark Sanford is out of politics because of that – because of the reach of the Trump Republican revolution.Sanford served in the House representing a Charleston-area district, and then was the state’s two-term Republican governor just before Haley was first elected in 2010. Sanford won his old House seat back in 2013, but then lost the Republican primary in 2018 because he was a sharp critic of then-President Trump’s fiscal policies, and sometimes of his tone.“I would say, ‘Well I’m for Trump in this area, but I’m against in these different areas.’ But people didn’t want nuance. They want: ‘Are you for or against him.’”Sanford wouldn’t directly answer when asked how he will vote in this month’s primary.But he did offer this: “I’ve never voted for Trump so far. I know that I’m not voting for him this time. I’ll let you read the tea leaves from that.”Sanford agrees when Haley goes after Trump for all the “chaos,” and especially when she highlights the deficit spending of the Trump years. Yet he expects a big Trump win in South Carolina, because the GOP electorate is so different now from when he was first elected.“What has traditionally worked in GOP politics isn’t so much working these days,” he said in an interview at his home in the Charleston suburb of Mount Pleasant. “He became sort of a proxy litmus test for ‘Are you for or against the system,’” Sanford said.“I’ve seen this erosion,” Sanford said. “Sort of Perot movement to Tea Party to Trump. It’s metastasized in ever aggressive forms. And what started out as a lot of well meaning Americans saying, ‘Look, we’ve got to do something about politicians doing what they said they were going to do’ (has evolved) into something much more strident. … It is their religion. I mean, I, I don’t know how else to explain it.”"

Matt Dolan, one of three Republican rivals locked in the bitter primary, asked supporters Monday night in Columbus.Yet for all of the GOP’s focus on trying to defeat Brown in November, there was far more conversation about Trump and a weekend rally near Dayton that reverberated on the eve of the election. The former president’s warnings about a “bloodbath” for the auto industry largely overshadowed the reason for his Buckeye State rally, which was to pull his preferred candidate, businessman Bernie Moreno, over the finish line.Trump’s involvement in this race is noteworthy because national Republicans – who decided to play in primaries this year, in part to avoid the kinds of candidates who emerged as flawed general election nominees in 2022 – have stayed out of this one. Despite already having clinched the GOP presidential nomination last week, Trump has a lot on the line in Ohio on Tuesday.Heading into Election Day, an ad airing from the Moreno campaign underscored just how much the former president has been omnipresent in their messaging. “MAGA alert: President Trump wants you to vote for outsider businessman Bernie Moreno,” the ad says. “Trump endorsed Bernie Moreno for Senate.”But Democrats are also trying to use the former president’s popularity in this red state to their advantage. An outside group affiliated with Senate Democrats’ top super PAC waded into the already expensive primary last week, launching ads that highlight Moreno’s support from Trump to prop him up over Dolan and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose. “Donald Trump needs Bernie Moreno. Ohio doesn’t,” the ad says.To win reelection, Brown needs a good chunk of Trump’s voters in a state that the former president twice carried by 8 points. The three-term incumbent is one of two Democrats running for reelection this year in states Trump carried – the other is Montana Sen. Jon Tester. Republicans need to flip only one or two seats – depending on who wins the White House – to control the Senate, and they’ve already effectively picked up one, with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin not running for reelection. That raises the stakes for Brown to hold on in a state that has trended red in recent years.On the eve of the GOP primary, the senator sought to tie his Republican opponents together and said he had no preference for whom he would rather run against.“I’ll let the rich guys fight it out,” he told reporters Monday in Dayton. “They’re spending their inheritance in this race. We know one thing – that they are all pretty much the same.”Moreno’s and Dolan’s willingness to pour their personal fortunes into their campaigns already has helped make this race among the most expensive contests of the 2024 cycle. At over $40 million as of Monday, Ohio’s Senate race trails only the US presidential race, the 2023 Kentucky governor’s race and the 2024 California Senate race in total ad spending so far.Gov. Mike DeWine and former Sen. Rob Portman’s recent backing of Dolan – the only one of the three candidates who has not explicitly endorsed Trump – has highlighted how this race is dividing the GOP between its Trump and establishment wings – and the different styles they bring to the race.At a crowded sports bar in the German Village neighborhood of Columbus on Monday night, Dolan sought to tie Brown to President Joe Biden, signaling that his argument for the fall would build upon challenging the administration’s record on inflation and immigration. Dolan mentioned Trump only in passing, telling supporters that he could outperform him in the suburbs.“We have to recognize that civility in politics is not a weakness,” Dolan said, taking a not-so-veiled swipe at the former president’s conduct. “We need to judge strength not on how loud we are, but by how much we get done for the American people.”DeWine implored Republicans to carefully consider their choice in the bitterly fought race. He said foreign policy should be a critical issue in the fall campaign, and he drew sharp distinctions with Trump and his soft touch on Russian President Vladimir Putin.“We have to win in November,” DeWine said. “The person who clearly has the best shot of winning in the fall is Matt Dolan – I think our common sense tells us that.”But the governor’s backing could cut both ways for Dolan, Ohio Republican strategists told CNN. It could drive turnout among older and higher-educated Republicans Dolan is primed to do well with, but it could also turn off some voters like Eric Lange.“Not a big fan of DeWine, so when I heard he endorsed (Dolan) that made me not want to endorse him even more,” the 40-year-old factory worker from Piqua said outside Trump’s Saturday rally.Trump attacked Dolan during his remarks, playing up the split in the party by trying to tie him to GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, and blasting him as a RINO, or “Republican in Name Only,” whose family changed the name of the Cleveland Indians to the Cleveland Guardians.Despite Moreno’s own history of criticizing Trump – he once called him a “fake Republican,” as CNN’s KFile previously reported – several Trump supporters told CNN ahead of his rally that they planned to support Moreno largely because of the former president’s endorsement.“If (Trump’s) put the finger on that guy, then that’s the guy for me,” said Anna Saylor, a 64-year-old from Hamilton.LaRose, who lacks the personal wealth of his opponents but has argued that his experience as the only statewide elected official in the race makes him best positioned to defeat Brown, dismissed the impact of both Trump and DeWine.“Endorsements are not the thing that most people make their decision based on,” he told reporters following a campaign stop in Sandusky over the weekend. “And it feels like one of my opponents in particular is trying to hide behind endorsements because he’s got a pretty liberal record that he doesn’t really want to explain. And that’s Moreno.”Lange, the factory worker from Piqua, admitted he holds concerns about Moreno’s electability in a matchup against Brown – fueled in part by Democrats’ success in passing Issue 1 last year, which enshrined abortion rights in the state constitution.Brown declined to say Monday whether he believed Moreno would be the easiest to face in the fall, as several Democratic strategists in Ohio have argued. He conceded his race for a fourth term is the most challenging contest of a career in elected office that spans nearly half a century.“Sure,” Brown said, “it may be my toughest race.”Ohio voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 before backing Trump by 8 points in both 2016 and 2020. Brown, who’s known as a progressive populist, is the last Democrat to hold nonjudicial statewide office in the Buckeye State. He won his last race, against a weak challenger without national party backing, by 7 points in 2018.Brown on Monday signaled the issues he intended to play offense on as a Democratic candidate running for reelection in the increasingly Republican-leaning state.“They all are for a national abortion ban. They have never supported organized labor. They’re all three against the minimum wage,” Brown said of his GOP opponents. “We’ll be ready for whoever it is.”"

        "title": "Two major Trump policy shifts explained in one interview",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Former President Donald Trump’s politics are mostly focused on himself, as opposed to an ideology, but two notable evolutions this week – on Social Security and TikTok – spotlight something new.Both Trump and President Joe Biden will look to sell their policy positions now that their general election rematch is upon us. Biden, for instance, has shifted on border policy, a calculated shift to address the border crisis and also triangulate support away from Trump. But Trump’s comments on TikTok and Social Security, both in an unfettered interview on CNBC, suggest not calculation, but confusion about Social Security and ambivalence about TikTok.Trump spent the primary and much of his political career promising to protect benefits at all costs, a switch for Republicans who have long been warning about deficit spending. Social Security was a top issue during the Republican presidential primary, when Trump attacked his GOP opponents, accusing them of wanting to take social security benefits away from older Americans.It’s not now clear what exactly Trump’s position is. In an ad-libbed and meandering answer during a telephone interview broadcast on CNBC, Trump seemed to suggest that he was open to cutting Social Security. Here’s the relevant portion of Trump’s exchange with CNBC’s Joe Kernen:KERNEN: It’s almost a third rail of politics. And we’ve got to what a $33, $34 trillion total debt built up and very little we can do in terms of cutting spending. Discretionary is not going to help. Have you changed your, your outlook on how to handle entitlements Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Mr. President? Seems like something has to be done, or else we’re going to be stuck at 120% of debt to GDP forever.TRUMP: So first of all, there is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements, tremendous bad management of entitlements. There’s tremendous amounts of things and numbers of things you can do. So I don’t necessarily agree with the statement. I know that they’re going to end up weakening social security because the country is weak.Trump’s long answer bounced from there to touch on the stock market, the need to drill for more oil in the US, inflation, and how he feels he doesn’t get enough credit for the economy or efforts to eradicate the terror group ISIS during his presidency.The gist, which President Joe Biden’s campaign was very quick to jump on, is that Trump is not always dismissive of cutting entitlements.Trump’s campaign spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, meanwhile, argued Trump was “clearly talking about cutting waste, not entitlements.”It’s not the first time Trump has struggled to both stick to his populist pledge to protect Social Security and also acknowledge the spiraling national debt, as CNN’s Abby Phillip pointed out.Watch:Trump’s Social Security comments may have just been an inarticulate answer, although social safety net spending should presumably be something a presidential candidate is prepared to talk about, especially if he made it a top issue of his primary campaign. His answer also did nothing to address Kernen’s larger question, about Social Security and Medicare’s insolvency crisis. The US government is on an unsustainable path, according to both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. The only presidential candidate who was seriously talking about reforming safety net spending this year, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, was beaten by Trump in part for talking about it.As president, he issued executive orders that would have forced ByteDance, TikTok’s China-linked parent company to divest the popular social media app, part of a larger anti-China effort during his time in the White House. The effort was stopped by federal courts as his term ended, although ByteDance did move to enact something it calls Project Texas meant to keep US users’ data away from China. That effort is not yet fully implemented. The US intelligence community has long warned that Chinese ownership of TikTok poses a national security threat. But the app continues to grow in the US, where 170 million Americans use it.House Republicans and many Democrats are carrying forward with a vote on a new law that would, like Trump’s executive orders, force ByteDance to spin TikTok off within roughly five months or bar it from US app stores.Trump, however, now says Facebook, not TikTok, is “an enemy of the people” and opposes, or at least doesn’t seem to care much about forcing ByteDance to spin TikTok off.“Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it,” Trump said in that CNBC interview. “There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it.”Biden, meanwhile, has suggested he would sign the bill to potentially ban TikTok, although senators may instead consider an alternative. Free speech advocates like the ACLU have argued banning an app where millions of Americans express themselves would violate the First Amendment. So expect legal challenges if the law is passed. CNN’s Brian Fung has a more in-depth look at the proposed bill and whether it would actually ban TikTok.A further element to consider is Trump’s recent meeting with the GOP donor Jeff Yass, who has been reported to have a large stake in TikTok and so has a financial interest in squashing the House bill. Yass has also said he is a longtime advocate for free speech and opposes targeting TikTok on those grounds.Former Trump aide Steve Bannon went so far as to suggest that Trump changed his mind on TikTok because of Yass. But Trump told CNBC the two did not even discuss the app.“I met with him very briefly. I made a speech and I said hello to him and his wife was lovely,” Trump said, adding that they talked about her﻿ ideas on education."

        "title": "Super Tuesday may underline Trump’s transformation of the GOP",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Heading into Super Tuesday, former President Donald Trump remains on track to potentially win more primaries and caucuses than any previous Republican presidential candidate other than an incumbent.His performance so far reflects his success at transforming the Republican Party in his image. He’s reshaped the GOP into a more blue-collar, populist and pugnacious party, focused more on his volatile blend of resentments against elites and cultural and racial change than the Ronald Reagan-era priorities of smaller government and active global leadership that former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has stressed. The refusal of almost any GOP elected officials to endorse his last remaining rival – despite the qualms some of them hold about the direction Trump is imposing on the party –testifies to their recognition that the former president now commands nearly unquestioned loyalty from a majority of the GOP coalition.But while the primaries have underscored Trump’s grip on the GOP, they have also demonstrated continued vulnerability for him in the areas where he has labored since he first announced his candidacy in 2015 – particularly among the white-collar suburban voters who mostly leaned toward the GOP before his emergence. The early 2024 nominating contests have shown that a substantial minority of Republican-leaning voters remain resistant to Trump’s vision. Even while posting such convincing victories, he has struggled with college-educated voters and moderates. Trump has carried only about 40% of independent voters who participated in the three contests where exit or entrance polls of voters have been conducted.Capturing both strength and weakness, the presidential primaries, as always, have offered important clues about the direction of the party holding them. As Trump nears what could be a crushing performance Tuesday, here’s a look at some of the key lessons about the GOP suggested by the results, and patterns of support, from this year’s primaries.The most important message from the primaries is the most straightforward: Trump’s coalition is the dominant faction in the GOP. Haley’s victory in Sunday’s low-turnout Washington, DC, primary will prevent Trump from winning every primary and caucus (as the past four incumbent GOP presidents have done.) But Trump is still faring better than any other Republican who was not an incumbent. (Reagan in 1980, Bob Dole in 1996, George W. Bush in 2000 and Mitt Romney in 2012 all won about 45 contests.)Veteran GOP pollster Whit Ayres said the primaries have shown that Republican voters are viewing Trump, in effect, as an incumbent president to a greater extent than the other candidates expected. Trump is trying to become the first defeated incumbent to win a rematch four years later against the man who ousted him from the White House since Democrat Grover Cleveland beat Republican Benjamin Harrison in 1892. Trump “is running as a quasi-incumbent,” Ayres said. To understand his dominance, Ayres continued, “What we really need are entrance polls and exit polls from the 1892 Democratic coalition for Grover Cleveland. That’s the analogy: a former president running again to defeat the guy who beat him.”Chris Wilson, who polled for the super PAC supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during the primary, likewise said, “Trump’s lead in the GOP race at this point” is rooted in “the perception among a large number of GOP primary voters that Trump is effectively our incumbent candidate.” None of the other candidates, he said, “found the message that makes them think they should dump their de facto incumbent.”Yet in important ways, Trump is a different candidate than he was in 2016. This time he’s much stronger among – and more reliant on – the party’s most conservative elements. In his first run, Trump attracted almost exactly the same level of support among voters who described themselves as very conservative, somewhat conservative and moderate, according to a cumulative analysis by Gary Langer of ABC News of all the exit polls conducted that year. This time – in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the three states where exit or entrance polls have been conducted – voters who describe themselves as very conservative have given him a much higher share of their votes than the other two groups; he’s lost moderates badly in all three states, never exceeding 28% of the vote among them.Likewise, Trump is posting huge advantages this year among Republican voters who identify as White evangelical Christians, while facing a much closer split among voters who don’t. The gap in his support between evangelicals and everyone else is much wider than it was in 2016.Education was already the most important dividing line in the 2016 race, with Trump running 12 percentage points better among voters without a degree than those with at least a four-year college education, in the cumulative analysis. That gap, too, is much wider this time: Trump has run at least 25 points better among voters without a degree than those with one in each of the three states that have been polled on Election Day. (There’s some preliminary evidence as well that those non-college voters are comprising a larger share of the total vote than they did in 2016.)“Trump’s strength has kind of changed,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the political newsletter Sabato’s Crystal Ball, which is published by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “It’s made him a more durable Republican candidate. But it remains to be seen what that means for the general election.”For all Trump’s strength, he has faced stubborn resistance from a significant minority of primary voters. Despite his sweep of the early nominating contests, his share of the vote hasn’t quite reached the heights of some other primary candidates in both parties. Counting Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan, Trump has won a little over three-fifths of the total combined vote so far. That slightly exceeds the share that Reagan won in 1980 and equals the percentage George W. Bush won in 2000, according to results compiled by Northeastern University political scientist William Mayer. But Trump still lags behind the last two candidates who most closely matched his advantages as a quasi-incumbent: vice-presidents George H.W. Bush in 1988 (who hit 68%) and Democrat Al Gore in 2000 (who reached 75%), according to Mayer’s tabulation.Trump’s total vote share may approach those heights after Super Tuesday, when six deeply conservative Southern states are among the 15 contests. But the size and consistency of the hold-out coalition behind Haley has surprised many in the GOP. Even with all his advantages, Trump in Iowa only won a little over one-third of voters with at least a four-year college degree. Haley beat him soundly among that group in New Hampshire and South Carolina. No exit poll was conducted in Michigan, but Trump’s totals lagged his statewide percentage there too in white-collar places like Oakland, Washtenaw and Kent counties. These trends are likely to continue on Super Tuesday.Haley’s consistent advantage among independents participating in the GOP primaries partly explains that trend, but even a substantial share of college-educated Republicans voted against Trump in the three states where voters were polled on Election Day. Moderates have flocked to Haley in large numbers in the early contests as well.Yet the clear message of the primaries is that those traditional center-right, often suburban, Republicans now constitute the subordinate minority in a party dominated by Trump’s more populist and volatile coalition. This power shift has changed both the party’s agenda and its priorities.The most significant shift is evident on foreign policy. When internationalist Dwight Eisenhower beat isolationist Sen. Robert Taft for the 1952 GOP presidential nomination, it marked a lasting turning point in the GOP’s internal balance of power. In every Republican presidency over the next six decades, the internationalist forces that supported a robust American role in the world set the course. Trump rejected that consensus when he was elected in 2016, but even during his tenure, Republican internationalists in Congress and his own administration resisted many of his efforts to downplay or abandon traditional alliances.Now that resistance is crumbling, both in the party’s elite and grassroots. A majority of House Republicans last fall voted against providing further aid to Ukraine; so did a majority of Senate Republicans this year. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs found last year that, for the first time in a half century of polling on American attitudes about foreign policy, a majority of Republicans now say the US would be better off to mostly stay out of global affairs; that view was strongest among the Republicans most sympathetic to Trump.More than any other prominent Republican, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who was first elected the year Reagan won his 49-state landslide reelection in 1984, has defended the Reaganite vision of America as the stalwart leader of the free world – the “shining city on a hill.” McConnell’s announcement last week that he would step aside as Republican leader in November marked an implicit acknowledgement that in Trump’s GOP, that Reaganite torch is flickering.Like McConnell’s announcement, the choices by GOP elected officials in the primary contest signal their acknowledgement of the party’s direction. The share of GOP elected officials who have endorsed Haley isn’t anywhere near as large as her share of the total vote. (Her list of prominent endorsers doesn’t extend much beyond New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and two moderate senators who backed her in the past few days, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.) Meanwhile, Republicans are scrambling over each other to bend their knee to Trump.The long line of GOP elected officials endorsing Trump reflects many factors. He’s demolished the standing of his critics – from former Rep. Liz Cheney to DeSantis – among Republican voters, and most in the GOP have grown deeply reluctant to challenge him. Trump’s early primary victories, and huge lead in the national primary polls, convinced other Republican officials that opposing him was a suicide mission.But a deeper factor also explains the imbalance in support among GOP elected officials. Trump has changed the electoral incentives for virtually everyone in the GOP. In the Trump era, hardly anyone in the party running in a competitive state can now rely on as much support from the college-educated voters who once anchored their coalition. That means virtually all Republicans need big turnout and margins among the same blue-collar, non-urban and culturally conservative voters most passionate about Trump. That gives other Republicans a powerful electoral incentive to move in Trump’s direction, in tone and substance. “There is no doubt the composition of our base is changing,” said Wilson.The reluctance of other elected GOP officials to cross Trump in the primaries suggests he would face even less internal resistance in a second term than he did in his first. At times in that first term, GOP congressional leaders resisted him, particularly on foreign policy. That seems much less likely now, with staunch Trump loyalist Mike Johnson installed as House speaker and McConnell stepping aside as Senate GOP leader. “No one could make the argument that McConnell or Kevin McCarthy gave Trump any significant pushback,” said Jennifer Horn, a former Republican Party chair in New Hampshire who has become a staunch Trump critic. “And they weren’t enough. Neither one of them could be loyal enough for him.”As Trump nears a possible knock-out blow on Tuesday, the most important unanswered question is what Haley and her voters do in November. The primaries have shown her coalition is not nearly big enough to deny Trump the nomination. But it is more than big enough to deny him a general election victory. Through Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, a consistent four-fifths of Haley voters have said they don’t think Trump would be fit to serve as president if he’s convicted of a crime, according to the entrance and exit polls. In the AP/NORC VoteCast polls, two-thirds of Haley voters in Iowa, three-fourths in New Hampshire and about three-fifths in South Carolina said they would not vote for Trump in a general election.In practice, it’s unlikely that so many Haley voters would actually reject Trump. In the days before the South Carolina primary, almost everyone I spoke with at Haley events disparaged Trump but said they would still vote for him over Biden, whom they viewed as both a failure and too old for the job. Distaste for Biden’s record and capacity may severely limit Democrats’ ability to convert Republican voters skeptical of Trump into crossover voters for Biden, predicted William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who has sparred with the GOP as an adviser to prominent Democrats since the 1980s. “Yes, there is a division” among Republicans, Galston said. “But is it going to manifest itself where it counts, in votes cast [for Biden]? I don’t see a lot of evidence for that so far.”Yet Republicans skeptical of Trump have noted that Trump might not be able to survive if even a meaningful fraction of Haley’s voters ultimately reject him. With Biden facing plenty of cracks in his own coalition, the independent, center-right, college-educated Republican-leaning voters who flocked to Haley present probably Democrats’ best opportunity to find new voters.“I expect most of those [Haley] voters to ‘come home’ by November, but the big caveat is that if Donald Trump keeps picking at the scab rather than letting the party heal, he could absolutely hurt himself,” said GOP pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, a CNN political commentator. “You need your party unified behind you to win a general in an era of deep polarization. You can’t afford to lose 10%+ to the other side.”One final point is clear as Trump nears his third consecutive GOP nomination: He isn’t relinquishing his grip on the party any time soon. Galston noted that since World War II, the GOP has undergone two previous fundamental shifts – when Eisenhower installed internationalism and greater acceptance of the New Deal as the party consensus in 1952, and when Reagan cemented a more aggressive economic, national security and social conservatism in 1980. “Trump is the third great transformer of the Republican Party since the end of the Second World War,” Galston said. “And like the previous two, the consequences will be with us for a long time.”Trump is consolidating his hold on the party infrastructure with the likely installation of his loyalists (including his daughter-in-law) in the top positions at the Republican National Committee. Ambitious younger Republicans are mostly defining themselves in his image. After the latest Ukraine vote, first-term Missouri GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt noted on social media that almost all of the 17 Republican senators elected since 2018 opposed the aid.Given the level of dominance Trump has displayed in this year’s primaries among both voters and elected officials, there’s no reason to assume that even if he loses a general election he wouldn’t try for the GOP nomination again in 2028, when he’d be about the same age Biden is now. But whether or not Trump regains the White House this year, and whatever he does next if he doesn’t, it seems certain that his shadow will envelop the GOP for years.“I think he will continue to be a significant influence over the party, its elected officials, its platform, its position on all of these important issues, for as long as he’s alive frankly,” said Horn.“I said back in 2016 that if the party embraced him and took him on, it would be 25 years before they were able to truly cleanse themselves of him. Now I don’t know if I gave it enough time,” she added."

        "title": "How Biden hopes to recapture voters scarred by inflation",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "As President Joe Biden barnstorms battleground states this week, he is framing the debate with former President Donald Trump around themes of economic populism that Democrats have employed, often with success, for decades. But Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, may prove to be a more elusive target for those arguments than a typical GOP candidate.Biden is portraying himself as committed to standing up for average Americans against powerful interests and the wealthy. But polls consistently show that significantly more Americans, including substantial numbers of Black and Hispanic voters, believe they personally benefited from Trump’s policies than Biden’s.That sentiment risks blunting Biden’s populist arguments: even if he can convince voters that Trump’s policies helped the rich and corporations the most, they may not mind as much if they believe that they also benefited more under Trump than they have under Biden.For Biden – who spent Tuesday meeting with Teamsters leaders and is headed to Wisconsin and Michigan the next two days – the critical question may be whether voters’ support for key ideas in his policy agenda can outweigh their frustration with their lived economic experience during his presidency. “You are really hitting on the crux of what a lot of swing votes will be [weighing] going into the election,” said Democratic pollster Danielle Deiseroth.Biden has plenty of ammunition to mount a traditional populist case against Trump. The former president’s principal legislative accomplishment was a massive tax cut that provided most of its direct benefits to corporations and the most affluent. Trump came within one Senate vote of repealing the Affordable Care Act, which has significantly increased health care coverage for lower-income working Americans. As a candidate in 2016, Trump pledged to seek legislative authority for Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices from pharmaceutical companies, but in office, under intense pressure from the industry, he abandoned that promise. Across a wide range of regulatory issues, from the environment to consumer protection, his administration consistently sided with business interests.Biden has set a very different course. He won the legislative authority for Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for seniors, and his administration is now negotiating lower prices for the first 10 drugs under that program; he also won authority to limit seniors’ monthly costs for insulin to $35 per month and to cap seniors’ annual out-of-pocket expenses for all drugs at $2,000. He passed significantly larger subsidies to help the uninsured buy coverage under the ACA, which has pushed enrollment to record highs. His administration has enforced the antitrust laws more aggressively than any in recent times and pursued a multi-pronged regulatory offensive against what he calls junk fees. The Covid-19 stimulus bill passed in 2021 included an expansion of the tax credit for families with children big enough to cut childhood poverty roughly in half, though the credit expired when West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin insisted on its removal in the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden did pass in that law a new 15% minimum tax for corporations.At the same time, the tax incentives for domestic clean energy manufacturing included in the Inflation Reduction Act and separate legislation promoting more domestic production of semiconductors, as well as the thousands of projects funded under the bipartisan infrastructure bill, have set off a boom in blue-collar employment with nearly 1.6 million jobs created in construction and manufacturing alone since Biden took office, according to administration figures. Biden also became the first president to walk a picket line when he joined the United Auto Workers during its strike against the nation’s three largest automakers.The new proposals Biden highlighted in his State of the Union last week and new federal budget released Monday also lean heavily into economic populism. “Overall, issues that economic populists have worked for years to put into the political mainstream got validated by President Biden,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Biden is proposing to raise the corporate tax rate, impose a 25% minimum tax on billionaires and end the Trump tax cuts for families earning over $400,000 per year (while retaining them for those making less). He wants to restore the expanded children’s tax credit, make permanent the larger subsidies for buying health insurance, provide a $10,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, establish a nationwide paid family leave program, and subsidize families’ child care expenses, partly by establishing universal access to preschool. He also called for increasing five-fold annually the number of drugs subject to Medicare negotiations, and to extend the caps on insulin and out-of-pocket drug costs to all Americans, not just seniors.Biden’s agenda, and the contrast it establishes with Trump’s policy priorities, gives Democrats plenty to work with in trying to portray themselves as champions of average families and Republicans as servants of the wealthy. “Our economic contrast is going to be that of Scranton, Pennsylvania, versus Park Avenue,” said Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign’s communications director. “We have the receipts because we are also running against a de facto incumbent. We saw what his economic policy looked like when he was in office and we have to clearly articulate that to people and remind people of what his priorities are.”The campaign, for instance, immediately denounced comments Trump made to CNBC Monday in which the former president signaled openness to cutting Medicare and Social Security. (Trump’s camp fired back by noting Biden also supported reductions in the programs to reduce the deficit at various points in his long Senate career.)But inflation, and its impact on the ability of working families to meet their bills, has greatly complicated Biden’s task in winning a conventional populist argument against Trump. Inflation has significantly moderated from its peak immediately after the Covid pandemic, but while prices are no longer increasing as fast, they remain about 18% higher than when Biden took office, and higher than that for such essentials as groceries, gas and rent. And while wages have been rising faster than prices since spring 2023, the cumulative increase in pay has not yet surpassed the cumulative increase in prices during Biden’s presidency, leaving many workers feeling squeezed. “What’s the disconnect between people’s experience and the [positive] economic movement that we’ve seen in the last four or five months?” asked Republican pollster Micah Roberts. “It’s three words: In-fla-tion. That’s it. It’s not a hard thing.”Pollsters in both parties say it is common in focus groups to hear participants say that they felt they had more money in their pocket at the end of the week when Trump was president. “Right before Covid, people were telling us it was the best economy they had seen in their lifetime,” said Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump. Now, he says, “They specifically blame Joe Biden for” their increased difficulty making ends meet. “Stand outside a grocery store,” McLaughlin added, “they’ll tell you how booming the economy is.”Polls leave little doubt Biden today is not only losing the economic comparison to Trump, but facing substantial skepticism among constituencies that usually are the principal target for a populist Democratic economic message. In a CNBC poll last October, not only did White voters say they were better off financially under Trump than Biden by a margin of more than 4-to-1, but so did non-white voters by a margin of nearly 2-to-1, according to figures provided by Roberts, whose firm conducts the survey with a Democratic partner. In the latest national NBC News poll, conducted by the same Republican-Democratic partnership, voters who identified as low-income and working-class trusted Trump over Biden on the economy by a crushing margin of 61% to 25%.Biden’s problems on the economy are especially acute with Hispanics. In a recent New York Times/Siena College poll, the Hispanic share of voters who said Trump’s policies had helped them personally was more than double the share who said that about Biden’s agenda. In the latest CBS News/YouGov national survey, the share of Hispanics who said the economy was excellent or good under Trump was 20 percentage points higher than the share who said the same about it under Biden. In 2020, Biden won about three-fifths of Hispanics, but in the CBS poll the share of Hispanics who said Trump fights for people like them virtually equaled the percentage that said Biden did. A majority of Hispanics, and even a plurality of Black voters, said Biden’s policies would cause inflation to rise, the survey found.Roberts said a major part of Biden’s problem on the economy is voters have such a concrete comparison available in their memories of the Trump record before the pandemic.“I think Trump’s messaging is really simple: we had a policy of creating domestic energy and becoming energy leaders; Biden on day one changed that and look what happened,” Roberts said. “We weren’t spending three trillion dollars on amorphous things that nobody can really put their fingers on. Biden did that, and look what happened to inflation. We had a policy that was strong on the border and immigration. On day one, Biden changed that and look what happened to our border – and by the way, that has economic impact. You can’t not make the contrast and comparison.”These negative retrospective assessments of the Biden and Trump economic records create huge headwinds for the president. His campaign, and Democrats more broadly, hope to overcome them primarily by stressing their prospective priorities for a second term. “This is not simply a retrospective comparison; this is also a comparison about the competing visions of the future,” Tyler said.Democrats point out that multiple polls show broad public support for almost all of the key agenda items Biden highlighted in the State of the Union and resistance to many Republican priorities, such as extending tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations or repealing the Affordable Care Act. “Voters—even past Biden voters who disapprove of his economic record—clearly reject what Trump and Republicans are offering,” Democratic pollster Margie Omero said in an email.In a report released last week, the Winning Jobs Narrative Project, a consortium of liberal advocacy groups, concluded that Democrats’ best chance to overcome voters’ continuing concerns about meeting their bills is to hammer home the populist case Biden sketched out in the State of the Union. By framing the election as a choice between “middle-out” versus “top down” and “trickle down” economics, “we think the president is absolutely on to something central to the direction Democrats should take in this election – which is who gets prioritized and how,” said Bobby Clark, a senior adviser to the group.After voters were exposed to Biden’s populist arguments, assessments of his economic record improved in the group’s polling, Clark said. But even after hearing that case, most voters in the group’s surveys still gave Biden negative marks for his economic performance, the study found.That finding may suggest the limits on how much Biden’s prospective agenda can offset voters’ discontent over their actual economic experience during his presidency. To win in November, most strategists in both parties agree, Biden doesn’t need to completely erase Trump’s advantage on the economy because so many voters resist the former president on other grounds, such as democracy, abortion rights, and the general chaos and conflict that he ignites.Still, Democrats would feel much better about the odds of those other concerns tipping the election in Biden’s favor if he can reduce his deficit on the economy to a more manageable level. To do that, Biden needs positive trends on the economy to persist – in particular, for wages to continue rising faster than prices, as they have since last spring.But he also needs to persuade enough voters that his agenda will do more than Trump’s to help them make ends meet in the future – even if they mostly believe the opposite has so far been true of Biden’s time in the White House."

        "title": "Trump wants more tariffs. His earlier trade wars cost Americans $230 billion to date",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "When former President Donald Trump was in the White House, he proudly referred to himself as a “Tariff Man” – and he has no intention of retiring that self-proclaimed title if reelected.Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of imposing a 10% tariff on every good coming into the US, as well as a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he regains the presidency. On Saturday, during a campaign rally, he promised a “100% tariff” on cars made outside the US and warned of a “bloodbath” for the American auto industry if he doesn’t get reelected.Starting in 2018, Trump put new tariffs of up to 25% on washing machines, solar panels, steel and aluminum, as well as many Chinese-made goods including baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs and sneakers – and President Joe Biden has left most of these tariffs in place.There could be many different reasons for imposing tariffs. Biden’s top trade official recently called them “a tool for remedying unfair trade.” But tariffs don’t bring in revenue from foreign countries, as Trump often claims. It’s American importers – not China or any other foreign country or company – that pays the tariffs.“A tariff is just a form of a tax,” said Erica York, a senior economist and research director at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation.“It’s the US purchaser, the importer of those goods, that makes the physical payment to the US government,” she added.Americans have paid more than $230 billion to date for tariffs that Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum and Chinese-made goods, according to US Customs and Border Protection. More than half of the duties have been collected during the Biden administration.Despite the cost, Trump’s tariffs were a political success, according to one working paper published recently by economic researchers.“Residents of regions more exposed to import tariffs became less likely to identify as Democrats, more likely to vote to reelect Donald Trump in 2020, and more likely to elect Republicans to Congress,” they wrote.Many people across the political spectrum agree that China uses unfair trade practices, and they like the idea of trying to get Beijing to change its ways. Plus, Trump gave farmers – who were hit hard by retaliatory tariffs – $23 billion in direct aid payments in 2018 and 2019 to help soften the blow of trade-related losses.The protection provided by tariffs typically comes with some trade-offs. Here’s how Trump-era trade policies have impacted the economy.When the US puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff comes directly out of the bank account of an American importer when the foreign-made product arrives at the port.It’s possible that some foreign manufacturers lowered their prices to stay competitive in the US market. But several studies have suggested that US companies and consumers are bearing the brunt of the tariff cost.In a 2023 study, the US International Trade Commission said that “U.S. importers bore nearly the full cost of these tariffs.” The independent federal agency, which provides analysis to the White House and Congress, estimated that prices increased by about 1% for each 1% increase in the tariffs on steel, aluminum and Chinese-made goods.Once the importing company pays the tariff, it can decide to eat the cost or pass all or some of it along to the buyer of its goods – whether that’s a retailer or a consumer. For that reason, it’s more difficult to determine how much of the tariff cost actually ends up being paid indirectly by American households. But one study, published in 2020, found that tariffs on washing machines raised the median price of one by about $86.Still, Trump’s tariffs were put on a relatively small share of all the goods consumers purchase. Several studies show they only marginally contributed to US inflation that followed the Covid-19 pandemic.Trump’s tariffs helped create some jobs, but even more were lost in the wake of his trade wars.Overall, the US economy lost jobs due to the tit-for-tat tariffs that took effect during the Trump administration, according to several studies, like one from the Tax Foundation and another from the US-China Business Council, a nonprofit whose goal is trade promotion.A study from St. Louis Federal Reserve economists provides more evidence that tariffs played a role in job losses. It showed states more exposed to US tariffs on imports from China experienced “lower increases or even decreases” in employment and output between 2018 and 2019.Trump’s tariffs were imposed, in part, to boost the US manufacturing sector – but that industry suffered a loss of jobs as well, according to at least one study.Federal Reserve economists found a net decrease in manufacturing employment due to the tariffs in 2019. That’s mostly because goods became more expensive to US businesses and consumers, and retaliatory tariffs put on American-made goods made other US manufacturers less competitive when selling abroad.Take this hypothetical example: Trump’s tariffs made foreign steel more expensive to US consumers – so much so, that some may switch to an American-supplier of steel. This is good for the US steel producer.But now, US manufacturers that use steel to make their goods are likely paying a premium for it. This makes it more expensive for some American manufacturers to produce their own goods and hurts their bottom line.“While one may view the negative welfare effects of tariffs found by other researchers to be an acceptable cost for a more robust manufacturing sector, our results suggest that the tariffs have not boosted manufacturing employment or output, even as they increased producer prices,” the Federal Reserve economists wrote.What’s more, the jobs that were created came at a high cost. Each new job in the steel industry was expected to cost steel buyers an extra $650,000, according to an analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Trump used tariffs as a negotiating tactic, meant to hurt China’s economy and pressure Beijing to agree to a new deal that addresses unfair trade practices, such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. Business leaders across the country, as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, tend to agree that China’s trade policies need to be addressed.Trump’s tariffs helped bring Chinese President Xi Jinping to the negotiating table. The two came to a truce in January 2020, signing what’s known as the Phase One agreement. It reduced the rate of some of the tariffs, and China agreed to increase its purchases of US goods and agricultural products – setting a target of buying $200 billion more than it did before the trade war began.But China fell well short of that commitment – which the Biden administration has suggested is one of the reasons it has kept tariffs on Chinese-made goods in place.While the text of the agreement included paragraphs that addressed Chinese intellectual property theft, it ultimately had no meaningful effect, said Derek Scissors, an economist and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank.“They did not have a monitoring mechanism, which is the absolutely critical part of IP if you want to have a deal with the Chinese. They didn’t even try,” Scissors said.A phase two agreement was never reached between the US and China under either the Trump or Biden administrations. In September, the two countries launched an Economic Working Group and a Financial Working Group that bring Washington and Beijing officials together for regularly scheduled meetings to discuss their economies."

        "title": "Older voters in this key battleground state are divided over whether Biden and Trump are too old to be president",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Darrell Ann Murphy teaches Mahjong at the local library with a dual purpose: to create new fans of the game she loves while also helping keep fellow seniors mentally sharp.She begins class with a rule that has nothing to do with how to play the colorful tiles.“We are all here to learn,” is Murphy’s opener. “We are all here for one reason. And we’re never going to talk religion or politics.”Sitting with us in her Easton home, however, the 83-year-old Murphy is happy to share she is a lifelong Democrat, a moderate, a supporter of abortion rights and fierce critic of Donald Trump.“He actually scares me,” Murphy said of the former president. “I think he does not have the best interest of the country at heart.”Easton is a deep blue city in a bellwether purple county in a battleground state that will be pivotal for both control of the White House and the Senate this year.Northampton County has a history of close races, and a history of picking presidential winners.Trump narrowly carried Northampton in 2016 and his narrow win in Pennsylvania was a critical piece of his Electoral College victory. Joe Biden flipped the script in 2020.Murphy shrugs off a conservative who says Biden – at 81 – is too old, dismissing such talk as partisanship. But other recent conversations have her more than a little nervous about the county’s 2024 leanings.“When I start talking about Joe Biden and how I admire and respect him, I get plenty of blowback,” Murphy said. “Plenty of blowback. ‘He is too old. Kamala Harris, forget her.’ Blowback. Now these are people who do not necessarily love Trump. But they talk about wanting a better choice.”Our visit to Easton is the latest stop in a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters in key states or demographic groups. Voters over the age of 65 are the most reliable voting group, and in the nail-biting battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, their support can prove decisive.An afternoon game of Mahjong at Murphy’s home is instructive: Even aging voters are divided over the 2024 age debate.Catherine Long is a fan of Murphy’s rule forbidding talk of religion and politics.“We can’t do that and play the game at the same time,” she said.Friend Mary Ann Horvath added that the policy is wise even when not focusing on pairing Mahjong tiles.“I hardly talk politics with anybody because you just don’t know what the other person believes,” Horvath said. That, everyone at the table agreed, is different from, say, 10 or 20 years ago – when you could debate politics without risking friendships.“Feelings are so much stronger now,” Horvath said.Still, a visitor decides to break the rule, and asks if anyone at the table would prefer younger candidates for president.The divide is immediate.“I think there should be an age limit at the top,” is the view of Pamela Aita.Murphy disagreed and recalled recently attending a friend’s 100th birthday party. “Shirley knows just what is going on politically,” Murphy said. “A lot of older people now are pretty darn sharp.”Aita was not persuaded.“But they are not running the country,” she said. “That person should be able to speak. That person should know who they are speaking to. That person should be able to know simple things that you and I would know. And I don’t think the person in charge of this country at this time is capable of that.”Long offered what she called the counter argument, pointing to the 77-year-old former president: “Donald Trump can’t know the difference between Nancy Pelosi and Nancy Haley.”Murphy was quick with the correction: “Nikki Haley.”“Nikki Haley,” Long repeated. “I get even those confused.”As laughter broke out, Long added this about her memory mixup: “This is what happens.”Larry Malinconico offered a take similar to what we heard from Murphy: He is a Biden fan and sees the age debate as a distraction.“I don’t think he has gotten appropriate credit for the things he has done,” Malinconico said.But he worries enough of his peers and some of his students do see Biden’s age as disqualifying, and he knows what even modest shifts in voter sentiment can mean in Northampton County and Pennsylvania.“I’d be more discouraged this year, at this point, about Trump being elected over Biden,” he said.Malinconico, 71, is a geology professor at Lafayette College in Easton. He is energetic and engaging in the classroom and says his views on age are shaped by his teaching and watching his father live to 94.“I don’t think that age is necessarily a determining factor,” Malinconico said in an interview at his campus office.Still, when we ask if he would have preferred that Biden had decided to serve just one term, and announced that months ago, the answer is, “Yes, I would.”Why?“I think there are people who will not vote for him or sit out because they perceive his age as a potential problem,” Malinconico said. “He looks physically more frail than he did a decade ago or two decades ago. And unfortunately, I think people equate physical frailty with lack of mental acuity. And I think that is wrong.”Malinconico listed reading, Wordle, crossword puzzles and physical activity when we asked what he does to stay sharp. Yes, a memory mixup now and then. But he said he believes his experience makes him a better teacher now than he was 10 or 20 years ago. “I hope to be learning until I die,” he said.Mickey Brown is West Point Class of 1966, which makes him 80. He plays tennis, pickleball and senior softball at this over-55 community in Hanover Township and says Sudoku and reading are his go-tos to keep his mind sharp.Three or four times a week he spends most of the day at a care center where his wife lives because of her dementia.“It’s just something you have to do,” he said, tearing up. “I believe in Jesus and God. I think it keeps me strong and I’ll be fine. And I want to make sure she is taken care of as well as she can be.”Brown is a conservative and two-time Trump voter. But he insists his worries about Biden are based on his experience, not his politics.“Caring for my wife, I see certain things in the way, his mannerisms, that make me wonder if he is really in fact the president,” Brown said.We reminded Brown that Trump, too, often meanders into verbal tangents and of recent episodes where he, at length, mixed up Haley and Pelosi and suggested the former South Carolina governor was somehow in charge of the US Capitol when Trump supporters stormed it on January 6, 2021.“At times I forget something,” Brown said. “Comes back. But I’m fit, I have confidence in myself. I just think the differences between the two are enough for me to be more concerned about Mr. Biden going forward than Mr. Trump.”Pat Levin calls Brown a friend. But she disagrees vehemently with his politics and with his take on Biden’s fitness to serve.“Donald Trump is essentially the same age and makes similar errors,” Levin said. “So I don’t fault Joe Biden. I think that’s just part of life. We are not infallible.”Levin was precise when asked her age: “94 and a half.”We met her at the SteelCore Studio in Bethlehem, where she comes once a week for a workout of crunches, balance exercises and more.“This is important for – to keep me vertical,” Levin said with a playful smile. “At my age I need all the help I can get.”Levin is a lifelong Democrat who is well aware of Northampton County’s bellwether legacy but also tends to forget it on a day-to-day basis, not because of any memory issues but because she generally is in the company of fellow Democrats.“To be honest with you, that always surprises me,” Levin said of Northampton’s history. “Because you tend to spend time with people who think the way we do. So, I think everybody is for Joe Biden until November comes. Then it surprises me.”The president’s age, she said, hardly ever comes up when she is in the company of friends who are about as old as Biden or even, like her, about a dozen years older.“They’re terrified of what might happen if Joe Biden doesn’t win,” Levin said.Terrified of what?“What will happen to this democracy.”Election Day is more than eight months away. Levin would be 95 then. Every crunch at SteelCore is her way of saying age is just a number, and she argues Biden should be judged by his performance, period.“I don’t think age should be a determinant of competence,” Levin said. “I don’t think they go together in any way, shape, or form. I know a lot of young people who are quite incompetent. I know a lot of older people who are very competent. And Joe Biden falls into that category for me.”"

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The foundation that selected SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch and other honorees as recipients of an award named after Ruth Bader Ginsburg announced Monday it is canceling its award ceremony after receiving pushback from the late justice’s family.Julie Opperman, chair of the Opperman Foundation, said in a statement “that the last thing we intended was to offend the family and friends of RBG.”“Our purpose was only to remember her and to honor her leadership. And, while we believe each of the honorees is worthy of our respect for their leadership and their notable contributions, the Foundation has decided that the planned ceremony in April 2024 will be canceled,” Opperman said.The slate of this year’s honorees for the foundation’s “RBG Leadership” award, formerly the “Ruth Bader Ginsburg Women in Leadership” award, was announced last week and also included lifestyle icon Martha Stewart, actor Sylvester Stallone and financier Michael Milken.Members of the Ginsburg family and a former clerk for the justice called on the foundation to pull her name off the award, with her son Jim Ginsburg telling CNN’s Paula Reid on Sunday that the choices of Musk and Murdoch were a “desecration of my mother’s memory.”“When you think of trying to create a more just society, which of course was Mom’s ultimate goal, those are probably about the last names that would come to mind,” he said.Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a longtime liberal member of the high court who died at age 87 in 2020, consistently delivered progressive votes on major social issues, including abortion rights, same-sex marriage and immigration.Opperman’s statement said the foundation had broadened the pool of potential honorees to men and included leaders from various fields out of the belief that Ginsburg’s “teachings regarding EQUALITY should be practiced.”“Keeping in mind that our goal is only to do good, the Foundation is not interested in creating controversy. It is not interested in generating a debate about whether particular honorees are worthy or not,” she said. “And while Justice Ginsburg’s concept of EQUALITY for women was very controversial for most of her life, the Foundation does not intend to enter the fray. Indeed, Justice Ginsburg was known for her civility.”"

        "title": "A speech that sent shockwaves from Washington to Jerusalem",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s warning that Israel risked becoming a “pariah” and his call for new elections marked a momentous moment in modern US-Israel relations.Schumer’s rebuke of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday contained extraordinarily strong language for a senior US politician criticizing the Israeli government. It was all the more remarkable coming from the New York Democrat who has a long record of staunch support for the Jewish state.The Senate floor speech was also an unmistakable sign of increasing frustration among top Democrats about Netanyahu’s conduct of the war in Gaza following the October 7 Hamas terror attacks that killed 1,200 people and his unwillingness to listen to US advice. It also reflects political realities in the United States. The deaths of more than 30,000 Palestinians in the conflict, according to the ministry of health in Gaza, have outraged US progressives, Arab Americans and younger voters in the US – all key parts of President Joe Biden’s coalition as he seeks reelection.Schumer – the highest-ranking Jewish American in the US government – warned that Netanyahu’s ultra-right-wing coalition was preventing the “significant course corrections” needed in the war against Hamas. He also voiced support for a two-state solution to the long conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, a position that Netanyahu has rejected. While placing the lion’s share of the blame for the civilian carnage of the war on Gaza’s Hamas rulers, he argued that Israel had an obligation to do far more to protect innocent Palestinian lives.“The Netanyahu coalition no longer fits the needs of Israel after October 7. The world has changed, radically, since then, and the Israeli people are being stifled right now by a governing vision that is stuck in the past,” Schumer said. “Five months into this conflict, it is clear that Israelis need to take stock of the situation and ask: Must we change course?” he continued. “At this critical juncture, I believe a new election is the only way to allow for a healthy and open decision-making process about the future of Israel, at a time when so many Israelis have lost their confidence in the vision and direction of their government.”Schumer noted that his name is derived from the Hebrew word Shomer, which means guardian, and spoke about how deeply he revered a country “surrounded by vicious enemies.” He added: “We love Israel in our bones. What Israel has meant to my generation, within living memory of the Holocaust, is impossible to measure. “But the Senate majority leader argued that there needed to be a fresh election so Israelis could decide on a new direction for their country in the post October 7 era.“Of course, the United States cannot dictate the outcome of an election, nor should we try,” he said. “That is for the Israeli public to decide – a public that I believe understands better than anybody that Israel cannot hope to succeed as a pariah opposed by the rest of the world.”Schumer’s comments laid bare the increasing tension between Democrats and the Israeli leader and the now gaping partisan divide over Israel between the two parties in the United States.He was almost immediately accused of deserting a US ally in a time of war and of trying to interfere in Israeli politics. Netanyahu’s Likud party, for instance, said pointedly in a statement that Schumer is “expected to respect Israel’s elected government and not undermine it.” It added: “Israel is not a banana republic, but an independent and proud democracy that elected Prime Minister Netanyahu.”“Israel is a sovereign democracy,” Israel’s Ambassador to the United States Michael Herzog wrote on X. “It is unhelpful, all the more so as Israel is at war against the genocidal terror organization Hamas, to comment on the domestic political scene of a democratic ally. It is counterproductive to our common goals.”Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also delivered a scathing response to Schumer’s speech, saying it was hypocritical of US leaders to warn of interference in US politics and then to try to do the same in Israel.“Make no mistake, the Democratic party doesn’t have an anti-Bibi problem, it has an anti-Israel problem,” said the Kentucky Republican, who has found rare common ground with Schumer recently since they both support sending more military aid to Ukraine. McConnell added: “Israel is not a colony of America whose leaders serve at the pleasure of the party in power in Washington. Only Israel’s citizens should have a say in who runs their government.”It’s a fair point that Schumer is meddling in Israeli politics – after all, he just called for an election in a foreign state. But it’s ironic for Netanyahu to complain. He has been playing politics in the US ever since the Obama administration, when he worked with Republicans to undermine the Iran nuclear deal. He also openly aligned himself with ex-President Donald Trump and was richly rewarded, including with the US moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.Schumer’s comments are the latest indication of an important shift in US politics that could have important indications for Israel moving forward, after years in which its government saw bipartisan support in Washington as a critical national interest.There’s little doubt that Schumer’s move was precipitated by extreme political pressure in his party – both inside and outside the Senate. Progressives are outraged at the thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza during the Israeli assault on Hamas. Arab Americans and left-wing Democrats mounted a protest that saw over 100,000 voters reject Biden in the recent Democratic primary in the critical swing state of Michigan. Biden’s allies insist those voters will come home to the president in the fall, but if they vote for someone else – or don’t vote at all – Biden’s hopes of a second term could be in serious jeopardy.The most fascinating question raised by Schumer’s comments is the extent to which his sentiments are shared by the White House. No modern president has been as pro-Israel as Biden, but it’s looking increasingly like Netanyahu has pocketed the president’s support while pretty much ignoring Biden’s advice and warnings about Israeli strategy and the impact on Palestinians in Gaza. The president dodged questions about Schumer’s comments during a visit to Michigan Thursday.But there have been signs of palpable frustration coming out of the administration in recent days. Earlier this month, Vice President Kamala Harris called for an “immediate ceasefire” in Gaza. Biden himself last week warned Netanyahu was “hurting Israel more than helping Israel” with his assault on the Palestinian enclave. Openly criticizing Israel goes against Biden’s political fiber, so these remarks carried significant weight. There’s a sense among many pro-Israel Democrats that Netanyahu is prolonging the war to forestall an election that could lead to his ouster as prime minister as he faces multiple legal threats. As such it’s hard to believe that Schumer – who is close to Biden – is not channeling some of the president’s views.Biden has been significantly damaged, politically at home and in a reputational sense with US allies abroad, for his unwillingness to do more to pressure Israel into a ceasefire and to put conditions on how US-made weapons can be used in the conflict.It is now crystal clear that the electoral interests of Biden and Netanyahu are directly incompatible, which is only likely to widen the rift between the two leaders."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants MOHELA (Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority) to answer for the problems student loan borrowers faced – including inaccurate bills and hourslong hold times on the phone – when the pandemic-related payment pause ended in the fall.In a letter first shared with CNN and sent to MOHELA on Monday, the Democrat from Massachusetts asks CEO Scott Giles to testify before a Senate subcommittee on economic policy, which she chairs, on April 10. MOHELA manages more than 8 million federal student loan accounts and is one of several student loan servicers that the Department of Education contracts with to collect student loan payments from borrowers.“Your company has contributed to student loan borrowers’ difficulties by mishandling borrowers’ return to repayment following the COVID-19 pandemic-related pause on payments, interest, and collections and by impeding public servants’ access to PSLF relief,” the letter said.PSLF refers to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which wipes away remaining student debt after qualifying public-sector workers make 120 monthly payments. MOHELA is the only servicer that handles PSLF payments.Student loan bills came due for more than 20 million federal student loan borrowers in October, after a more than three-year pause on payments and interest.Bringing so many people into repayment at the same time was an unprecedented task, and industry experts expected the process to be bumpy.Making matters even more complicated, lawmakers left funding flat for the Federal Student Aid office, which oversees the financial aid system, despite its bigger workload this year. Plus, Federal Student Aid was tasked last year with launching a new income-driven repayment plan called SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education) and an updated version of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, better known as the FAFSA.Nearly 9 million borrowers – roughly 40% of the 22 million borrowers who had bills due in October – missed making their first student loan payment.The Department of Education has already penalized MOHELA – by withholding a $7.2 million payment in October – for failing to send the first round of billing statements on time to 2.5 million borrowers. More than 800,000 people were late making their payment as a result of the mistake, according to the Department of Education.The servicing problems weren’t isolated to MOHELA’s borrowers after the repayment pause ended. The Department of Education instructed all student loan servicers to put any borrowers impacted by a servicing mistake into an administrative forbearance during which they are not required to make payments.Warren has warned that there could still be problems in the months ahead.The Department of Education has created a 12-month on-ramp period meant to temporarily protect borrowers from the worst consequences of missing a payment. Borrowers who miss a federal student loan payment through September 2024 won’t be reported as delinquent or in default to the three national credit bureaus.Warren has said that the “chaotic resumption” of payments raises questions about how effectively the on-ramp will be implemented and whether there will be unintended consequences to borrowers’ credit scores."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Donald Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen and adult film star Stormy Daniels will be allowed to testify at the former president’s New York criminal trial, a judge ruled Monday.Judge Juan Merchan denied a motion from Trump’s attorneys to prevent Cohen and Daniels – two key witnesses in the Manhattan district attorney’s case – from testifying at Trump’s hush money trial, which could begin next month.The judge also ruled that he would allow testimony about Trump’s infamous “Access Hollywood” tape – but that playing the tape itself to jurors was “not necessary.”The district attorney’s office charged Trump with falsifying business records, accusing him of concealing the reimbursement of hush money payments Cohen made to Daniels before the 2016 election to keep her from going public about an alleged affair with Trump. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denies the affair.Trump’s lawyers sought to block Cohen’s testimony, arguing that Cohen previously committed perjury and alleging that he lied in his testimony at Trump’s New York civil fraud trial last year.But Merchan wrote in his decision that Cohen had not been charged with perjury for his more recent testimony.“Defendant provides examples of situations where Cohen’s credibility has been called into question. However, he offers no proof of perjury in the case at bar,” Merchan wrote, noting that he found nothing to support “Defendant’s rationale that a prosecution witness should be kept off the witness stand because his credibility has previously been called into question.”Merchan also denied a bid from Trump’s attorneys to block Daniels from testifying about the hush money payment she received from Cohen in 2016.“Locating and purchasing the information from Daniels not only completes the narrative of events that precipitated the falsification of business records but is also probative of the Defendant’s intent,” Merchan wrote.The judge also ruled he will allow testimony from former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who alleged she had an affair with Trump, though he granted there would be limitations on her testimony that would be discussed further at trial.Merchan did not address in this ruling a complaint from Trump’s attorneys about a new documentary about Daniels, in which she spoke about the hush money payment.Trump’s attorneys have argued the release of the documentary should be grounds to dismiss the indictment or delay the trial since it came one week before jury selection was scheduled to begin. They said some of Daniels’ statements, including concerning threats of violence, would be prejudicial to Trump. They blame prosecutors for not alerting them about the documentary.The New York trial was supposed to begin March 25, but it has been delayed after new evidence was turned over this month from the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.Merchan has scheduled a hearing on March 25 to discuss the circumstances behind the new evidence and a motion from Trump to dismiss or delay the trial over it. He said he could set a new date after that hearing.Merchan wrote Monday that he would allow testimony about Trump’s “Access Hollywood” tape, which was released one month before the presidential election in 2016. But he decided that playing the tape to the jury was not necessary.Trump’s lawyers had objected to prosecutors’ desire to use the 2005 tape as evidence to show that Trump and his campaign staff “were deeply concerned that the tape would harm his viability as a candidate and reduce his standing with female voters in particular.”Merchan wrote that he would allow testimony on the tape, in which Trump can be heard graphically bragging about how he would use his stardom to aggressively come on to women, because “it helps establish Defendant’s intent and motive for making the payment to Daniels and then, attempting to conceal them.”But the judge added that he agreed with Trump’s lawyers “that a compromise should be struck to avoid undue prejudice to the Defendant.”“This court rules that the proper balance lies in allowing the People to elicit testimony about a videotaped interview which surfaced on October 7, 2016, that contained comments of a sexual nature which Defendant feared could hurt his presidential aspirations,” Merchan wrote. “However, it is not necessary that the tape itself be introduced into evidence or that it be played to the jury.The judge also gave Trump’s lawyers a warning in his decision: “The court may reconsider this aspect of the ruling should the Defense open the door.”Merchan also declined to rule before trial on whether the district attorney’s office could introduce evidence of sexual assault allegations levied against Trump after the Access Hollywood tape was released, writing he was reserving that decision.This story has been updated with additional reporting."

        "title": "Award in Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s name given to Elon Musk and Rupert Murdoch is a ‘desecration’ of her memory, son says",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The son of the late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Sunday that giving an award bearing his mother’s name to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch is a “desecration of my mother’s memory.”“I don’t want to speak to what our other plans might be if the foundation doesn’t see the wisdom of desisting and ending this desecration of my mother’s memory, but I will say that we will continue to fight this,” Jim Ginsburg told Paula Reid on “CNN Newsroom.”Ginsburg’s family recently sent a letter to the Opperman Foundation, which bestows the award and is not affiliated with the family, blasting the selection of this year’s nominees and requesting her name be taken off the award.The Ginsburg award “celebrates leaders who have demonstrated extraordinary accomplishments in their chosen fields,” according to the foundation. The award “has previously recognized women of distinction” but was expanded this year to include men and women.In addition to Musk and Murdoch, lifestyle icon Martha Stewart, actor Sylvester Stallone and financier Michael Milken are also 2024 recipients of the award. The 2023 honoree was Barbra Streisand.Asked whether he took exception to men now being included in the award or to the recipients themselves, Jim Ginsburg said, “Well, we could discuss that, but yeah, the particular awardees, and we can discuss the wisdom of each one, but the two that obviously stand out here are Elon Musk and Rupert Murdoch.”“When you think of trying to create a more just society, which of course was Mom’s ultimate goal, those are probably about the last names that would come to mind,” he said.“I think she’d be appalled,” he later told Reid.The Opperman Foundation did not respond to an inquiry Friday from CNN. CNN also reached out Sunday night for comment on Jim Ginsburg’s interview.Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a longtime liberal member of the high court who died at age 87 in 2020, consistently delivered progressive votes on major social issues, including abortion rights, same-sex marriage and immigration.The Opperman Foundation described the 2024 award recipients as ranging from “path-breaking innovators to seasoned veterans across a broad range of professions and industries.”In the announcement, the foundation said Stewart was on Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s “original wish list of potential honorees.” The organization credited Musk’s “stratospheric accomplishments” and Murdoch as “the most iconic living legend in media.”But Jim Ginsburg said the honorees don’t represent what his mother stood for.“I think these are people who pretty much stand against all the things that she stood for in terms of trying to … make the world a better place, for people striving for equality and for a more inclusive world where everybody is treated with respect,” he added."

        "title": "With Trump set to return to court, his delaying strategy is working so far",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Donald Trump looks like he’s succeeding in running out the clock.The former president’s common strategy across his four criminal trials is to use the constitutional protections granted by a legal system he claims is corrupt to push the moment he will stand before a jury until after the election in November.Trump has long been an expert in tying the courts in knots by exhausting every single avenue of appeal – often using fanciful legal strategies that nevertheless take time to litigate – to postpone accountability.The technique will be on display on Thursday when Trump’s lawyers challenge the legality of special counsel Jack Smith’s case against the presumptive Republican nominee over his hoarding of classified documents at his Florida resort, with Trump expected to be in attendance.Judge Aileen Cannon will hear Trump’ motions seeking the dismissal of the case, partly based on his argument that he was entitled to take classified documents to his residence. He is also claiming that he is the victim of selective prosecution and was treated differently than other senior officials who had classified material – like President Joe Biden – despite clear differences in their cases. And, as in other courtroom dramas, he’s making a sweeping claim of presidential immunity in keeping with his apparent belief that the nation’s highest office put him above the law.Cannon is also currently weighing a postponement of the late May start to the trial that would play into Trump’s attempts to prevent it from beginning before November.Not for the first time, a real sense of frustration seeped into Smith’s legal filings in the case last week. He asked Cannon to throw out what he called the former president’s “frivolous” arguments, saying, the “immunity claim here is so wholly without merit that it is difficult to understand it except as part of a strategic effort for delay.”Frustration has also been growing with Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge who critics argue has been enabling the ex-president’s schemes with the stately pace at which she is conducting pre-trial business. As in all his criminal cases, Trump has pleaded not guilty.The hearing in Fort Pierce, Florida, takes place a day after Trump notched a legal win in a separate matter – the election interference case in Georgia. The judge dismissed six charges in the 41-count indictment related to Trump and some co-defendants, saying the charges lacked required detail on the underlying alleged crime – pressing the state legislature and officials to overturn the 2020 election. The decision was a blow to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, even though Judge Scott McAfee left most of the racketeering indictment intact. Trump now faces 88 – rather than 91 – criminal charges across four cases.McAfee has been busy even though any trial is not expected for months. He is expected to announce his decision by Friday on whether to disqualify Willis from the case on the grounds of an alleged conflict of interest regarding a romantic relationship with an attorney she hired to help her prosecute the case. A decision to bar Willis would be a massive victory for Trump since it would rule out the entire Fulton County district attorney’s office and could see the case pass to another jurisdiction. Such a step would almost certainly add further delays to a complex case, likely pushing it into next year at least.Trump’s efforts to run out the clock on his federal election trial are also bearing fruit. His use of his right to extensive appeals has already taken up many weeks, and the Supreme Court’s decision to hear his extraordinary claims of presidential immunity is severely threatening Smith’s hopes of trying the case this year. The high court will not even hear arguments on the case until next month and a decision on the matter may not come until the end of June. If the justices don’t side with Trump’s claim that he cannot be prosecuted, and Smith’s case moves forward, time will still be extremely tight to get it on the docket this year. Judge Tanya Chutkan could face a fateful decision on whether to go ahead in the frenetic closing months of the general election campaign.One trial that does look set to open soon, on March 25, is potentially the least damaging one to the former president. The New York criminal case involves a hush money payment to a former adult film actress. But even here, Trump has been trying his delaying tactics. He wants the judge to push back the trial until after the Supreme Court rules on his presidential immunity case. This seems a long shot since the hush money payment was made before the 2016 election and before Trump took office. But the prosecution plans to bring in some evidence in the form of Twitter posts that he made while he was in the Oval Office, offering an opening – albeit a narrow one – to Trump’s attorneys.Trump’s motivation in delaying the trials is not just to put off his multiple days of judgment. He appears to want to also forestall jury verdicts until after the general election – likely because polls have suggested some voters would be less keen to vote for him if he is a convicted felon. But if he wins in November, Trump might regain the executive powers to stop the two federal cases against him – over the classified documents and election interference – or overturn any convictions.That possibility has frustrated many Democrats and legal analysts who hope voters will have the chance to take the measure of Trump’s culpability and any convictions before the election.At the same time, however, the ex-president is taking advantage of all the channels of appeal and pre-trial motions that would be available to any other American – even if the crush of indictments and trials would be unusual for anyone to face, let alone an ex-president running to get his old job back.Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin argued that while Trump’s motives are transparent, the integrity of the legal system that the former president has long sought to subvert rests on sticking to constitutional principles.“If you are a walking crime wave like Donald Trump, you can trample every criminal, civil, disciplinary, ethical boundary you want and then you know that it’s going to take time for the justice system to catch up with you,” Raskin, who served on the House committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, told CNN’s Manu Raju on Wednesday. “But that’s in the nature of the justice system, based on due process, but we’ve got to stick by the rule of law. It’s all we’ve got.”Former Georgia state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that in the case of the Peach State indictment against Trump and the fate of Willis, the judge was doing his due diligence in order to ensure the integrity and efficiency of the trial.“Of course, it’s going to push it back,” Jordan said Wednesday. “What he is concerned with is to make sure that the indictment is bullet proof in terms of any appellant issue that may be brought up in the future.”While Trump’s slow walking has so far succeeded in the criminal cases, his recent and heavy blows in the civil legal system prove that while accountability can be delayed, it cannot always be denied. He already owes half a billion dollars to satisfy two recent court losses – a civil fraud trial related to the Trump Organization and a defamation case brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll.If several of the criminal cases go against him as well, if and when they eventually come to trial, Trump could face a very grim future if he loses November’s election."

        "title": "Judge in classified documents case grapples with how Trump’s personal records claim could be explained to a jury",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Federal Judge Aileen Cannon issued an order Monday for lawyers to submit instructions for a trial jury in former President Donald Trump’s classified documents case – signaling that the debate over whether Trump had the authority to keep documents from his White House could remain a central issue of the case, which could help him at trial.But – to the surprise and confusion of several legal experts on Monday – Cannon asked the attorneys in the case to consider how to incorporate into the trial the Presidential Records Act.The request is an unusual one that leads both sides into hypothetical, untrodden territory.Cannon asked both the Justice Department and defense team to contemplate how a jury could be told to weigh the criminal law around national security records if Trump could say the PRA gave him authority to keep documents he chose.The Justice Department maintains his charges have nothing to do with the PRA and are about what happened after the presidency: how classified records about US and foreign military secrets were kept without federal protection at a private beach club and allegedly moved around so government officials wouldn’t find them.Cannon’s order on Monday could also be viewed as a logic exercise that’s hard to parse – even for experienced lawyers trying to determine where she is leading the attorneys involved.“I don’t get what she’s doing with this. I don’t understand where she is going with this order,” Brad Moss, a national security lawyer, told CNN on Monday. “It’s a bizarrely written set of questions that doesn’t lend itself to an easily understandable set of answers.”Moss added it’s possible Cannon wants to push some questions about the documents Trump kept to the jury, as she’s held back on deciding many legal disputes in Trump’s landmark case.Cannon’s order asked both the special counsel’s office and Trump’s attorneys to write jury instructions defining terms of the Espionage Act, under which the former President is charged for mishandling 32 classified records. Part of the law under which Trump is charged criminalizes a person having unauthorized possession of records related to national defense.Still, the judge asked prosecutors and defense lawyers to write versions of their proposed jury instructions that consider the PRA by April 2. “Engage with the following competing scenarios and offer alternative draft text that assumes each scenario to be a correct formulation of the law to be issued to a jury,” Cannon wrote on Monday.The first version would instruct a jury to decide whether prosecutors proved that Trump did not have the authorization to keep classified documents found on his property, even if they were personal or presidential records. The second scenario would assume that as president, Trump had complete authority to take records he wanted from the White House under the PRA.Moss said the second scenario appears to be the equivalent of a judge in a murder case asking how to advise a jury to weigh the facts, “if the murder had taken place during The Purge” – referencing a movie where all crime is legal for a set period of time.The exercise is a continuation of a hearing last week, during which Trump’s attorneys claimed that he had unlimited power to decide which documents needed to be returned to the National Archives under the PRA.Trump is asking Cannon to dismiss the charges against him because of the PRA.Though Cannon appeared skeptical during the hearing that the charges against the former president should be dismissed because of the PRA, she said that the arguments could be a “forceful” trial defense."

        "title": "Biden and Netanyahu speak for the first time in a month amid deepening rift",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "President Joe Biden spoke by phone Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, their first known interaction in more than a month as a rift deepens between the two men over the war in Gaza.During the call, the White House said the leaders discussed two key areas where tension has emerged in the relationship, including the necessity of getting more humanitarian aid into Gaza and the pending Israeli operation in Rafah, where more than a million Palestinian civilians are sheltering.Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters later that the president voiced “deep concerns” over Israel’s plans for the Rafah operation during his conversation with Netanyahu.Biden asked Netanyahu to send a senior delegation of military leaders to Washington to discuss the issue further and to lay out an alternative approach to go after Hamas in Rafah. Netanyahu agreed to dispatch such a group, and Sullivan said the meeting was likely to occur at the end of this week or early next week.“A military plan cannot succeed without an integrated humanitarian plan and political plan. And the president has repeatedly made the point that continuing military operations need to be connected to a clear strategic end game,” Sullivan said at the White House, noting that more civilians had died in Gaza than any previous conflict in the enclave and that “anarchy reigns” in parts of the strip.In a statement afterward, Netanyahu said he told Biden that Israel was committed to achieving its goals in Gaza while also providing the necessary humanitarian aid to the enclave.“We talked about the latest developments in the war, including Israel’s commitment to achieving all the goals of the war: the elimination of Hamas, the release of all our hostages, and the promise that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel – while providing the necessary humanitarian aid that helps achieve these goals,” Netanyahu said, according to the Prime Minister’s Office readout.Monday’s phone call came days after one of Biden’s top allies in Washington, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, called for new Israeli elections that would result in Netanyahu’s ouster.Biden called the speech “good” and said it reflected the concerns of many Americans, though did not explicitly endorse nor condemn the call for new elections in Israel.Netanyahu on Sunday forcefully pushed back on Schumer’s speech during an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash.“It’s inappropriate to go to a sister democracy and try to replace the elected leadership there. That’s something that Israel, the Israeli public does on its own, and we’re not a banana republic,” Netanyahu said on “State of the Union.”The Biden-Netanyahu relationship has devolved over the past several months as frustration inside the White House mounts over what American officials regard as Netanyahu’s rejection of US advice on the war in Gaza.After speaking on a daily or weekly basis at the onset of the conflict, Biden and Netanyahu now speak far less frequently. Their last phone call before Monday was on February 15 – the longest gap in calls since the October 7 terror attacks that launched the current conflict.Tensions have emerged over allowing more humanitarian aid to enter the strip, steps to protect civilian casualties and the future of an eventual Palestinian state.Netanyahu raised concerns over “a variety of things that have come out in the American press” during the call, Sullivan said. Speaking Monday, Sullivan declined to detail whether Netanyahu raised concerns about Schumer’s speech. But he said Biden was not focused on the politics of the conflict.“From President Biden’s perspective, this is not a question of politics. It’s not a question of public statements. It’s a question of policy and strategy. That’s what he’s focused on. That’s what he was focused on in the call,” he said.Still, Sullivan noted a certain irony in Netanyahu appearing on American television to complain about political interference.“You have the prime minister speaking on American television about his concerns about Americans interfering in Israeli politics,” Sullivan said. “And then your question is, should Americans be speaking into Israeli politics, which, in fact, we don’t do nearly as much as they speak into ours.”The White House has said an operation in Rafah should not move ahead without a credible plan to protect the civilians sheltering there. As of Monday, officials said they had not seen such a plan. Biden said in an interview last weekend that an invasion of Rafah would amount to a “red line,” though did not delineate how he would respond and said he would never cut off support for Israel entirely.Speaking with Netanyahu, Biden “explained why he is so deeply concerned about the prospect of Israel conducting major military operations in Rafah,” Sullivan said.He said those concerns fell within three areas: that civilians sheltering in Rafah have nowhere safe to go; that Rafah is an entry point for critical humanitarian assistance; and that neighboring Egypt has voiced serious concerns about a potential military operation there.“Our position is that Hamas should not be allowed at safe-haven in Rafah or anywhere else. But a major ground operation there would be a mistake, it would lead to more innocent civilian deaths,” Sullivan said.Sullivan described the call as “businesslike” and it “did not end abruptly.”“It ended in a totally normal way when they had each gotten through all of their points,” Sullivan said, adding the leaders “recognize that we are at a critical moment in this conflict.”He said Biden and Netanyahu “share a common objective that is for Israel to prevail over Hamas” but that they “have a different perspective on this operation and Rafah – and they went into some detail on that and had the opportunity to elaborate each of their respective views in a full-throated way, in the way they always do when President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu talk.”“So in that sense, I would say this call was much like a previous calls that the two of them have had, they each agreed to have the teams get together and then they agreed that the two of them would stay in touch as we go forward,” he said.Biden and Netanyahu also discussed negotiations for an immediate ceasefire for “several weeks” in return for releasing hostages held by Hamas and other militants in Gaza.“We would look to build on that ceasefire into something more enduring and use the space created by a cessation of hostilities to surge humanitarian assistance,” Sullivan said. “So far, the deal has been more elusive than we would have hoped, but we will keep pressing because we regard this as an urgent priority.”He stressed that Hamas could “end the crisis tomorrow” and called for more pressure on the group to end the conflict.Sullivan said the two leaders had agreed to “stay in close touch” in the days and weeks ahead and that the US and Israel were in “daily contact on every element” of the crisis.This story has been updated with additional developments on Monday."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Americans may feel like they’re reliving 2020, with a general election rematch set for 2024. But while the politicians’ faces are the same, life is much different.On March 13, 2020, then-President Donald Trump declared a national emergency for the Covid-19 pandemic.No one knew at the time exactly how much life was about to change. Reading CNN’s coverage from that era, however, is like transporting oneself back to the time that so many people have either forgotten or want to block out. We had no idea what was coming.But it’s equally remarkable, precisely four years later, how Covid-19 has both changed American life and also faded to the background.Lockdowns, face masks and the question of whether kids should be in the classroom were daily, top-of-mind issues that had very real impacts on how people voted in 2020. The special measures states took to ensure that more people could vote during the pandemic formed the basis of the conspiracy theories by which Trump today refuses to believe he lost back then.Nearly 1.2 million people in the US have died from Covid-19 during the past four years, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While mass outbreaks and hospitalizations appear to be over, there were still at least 500 people who died of Covid-19 per week as of the week ending March 2. In January of this year, more than 2,000 Americans died of Covid-19 each week.The US government acknowledges spending about $4.4 trillion to address Covid-19, a shocking figure in hindsight that spiked the national debt.That doesn’t count the trillions in extraordinary measures undertaken by the Federal Reserve, which added more than $4 trillion to its balance sheet during the pandemic.People can debate what role the federal spending had on inflation, but it also helped stabilize the country at a time of unprecedented uncertainty when the US economy essentially shut down. It’s remarkable to consider that in exit polls for the 2020 presidential election, 44% of voters said the pandemic caused them no financial hardship at all.Inflation that spiked after people emerged from lockdown has begun to ease, but Americans still have trouble making ends meet despite better wages.Higher interest rates make homebuying seem out of reach to many. Empty office buildings and the uncertain state of commercial real estate means the aftereffects of the pandemic are not yet entirely known.Other countries have a lot more adapting left to do. Read about how many Covid-19 precautions are just being lifted in China, which maintained a draconian zero-Covid policy that locked out the world for years.President Joe Biden felt the need to jog people’s memories during his State of the Union address that the pandemic first struck when Trump was president.“Remember the fear. Record job losses. Remember the spike in crime. And the murder rate,” Biden said last week, trying to flip the script on complaints about public safety in recent years. He added, “The pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccines that saved us from Covid are now being used to help beat cancer. Turning setback into comeback.”Trump, offering live commentary on the speech on his social media platform, wanted credit for Covid-19 vaccines.“YOU’RE WELCOME, JOE,” he wrote, adding that vaccines were developed quickly while he was in office – although presumably any president would have done everything possible to aid the development of vaccines.The more interesting development from that post was the instant backlash Trump got from some of his normal allies who are vaccine skeptics. One constant in Trump’s 2024 stump speeches is his pledge to strip public money from any school district that imposes a vaccine requirement on students. His campaign argues he only means the Covid-19 vaccine, but vaccine skepticism is growing in the US, as are outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles.One new voice gaining attention in presidential politics is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the vaccine skeptic who rivals Trump in his embrace of conspiracy theories and is trading on his famous name to run as an independent candidate. Kennedy draws 15% of the vote in some polls. Kennedy and the super PAC that supports him are targeting swing states as they gather signatures to appear on the presidential ballot.A recent Pew Research Center survey shows a decline in concern among Americans. According to CDC data, less than 23% of US adults reported getting the most recent, recommended dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.Only a little more than a quarter of adults (28%) said they were up to date on the latest Covid-19 vaccine.There is an expected partisan divide in those figures: 42% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are up to date compared with 15% of Republicans and GOP leaners.On the other hand, the partisan gap in concern about the coronavirus has shrunk. Most people in both parties do not see Covid-19 as a major public health threat. The official US public health emergency ended in the US in May 2023.The physical threat of the disease has diminished, which led the CDC to recently drop recommendations that people who contract it isolate for multiple days. Now the government suggestions are in line with those of other respiratory infections. People who get Covid-19 should stay home only until they have been fever-free without medication for at least 24 hours and had improving symptoms for 24 hours.In changing the guidelines, CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said most of the US population has some immunity against Covid and that large waves of infections have given way to smaller and more predictable bumps in the summer and winter. Read more from CNN’s Brenda Goodman.Covid is still a challenging disease for many. In addition to the predictable seasonal bumps, studies suggest large numbers of Americans are dealing with long Covid.More than 9% of women who contracted Covid during pregnancy reported having symptoms six months or more after they were infected, according to one study. Pregnant women might actually get long Covid at lower rates than the general population.Another study looked at the effect on children, up to 6 million of whom have developed long Covid. Children may not get over the physical symptoms of long Covid for more than a year, but there may be compounding effects if they miss out on a year or more of experience while they recuperate. A survey from late last year found that nearly 1 million US children and nearly 18 million US adults reported symptoms of long Covid. Read more from CNN’s Jen Christensen.Every child who was alive during the Covid era will have been affected by that formative experience.A New York Times review of testing data earlier this year suggested there was a rebound in 2023 from Covid learning loss, the well-documented drop in test scores after so many students spent so long away from the physical classroom.But the rebound is far from complete, and it is more pronounced in richer school districts – evidence for the obvious takeaway that the pandemic will have driven financial inequality particularly for children.One controversial move Democrats made when they doubled down on Covid relief without Republicans in the early days of the Biden administration was to create a temporary, new benefit that put money in the pockets of low-income parents by expanding the child tax credit and making it “refundable.” The payments temporarily raised millions of American kids out of poverty.But inflation spiked and public sentiment turned on public safety net expansions, and the tax credit expansion expired. Democrats could not marshal the votes to extend it. Biden made the pitch to bring the expanded tax credit back (paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy) in his State of the Union address. The House recently passed a bill to expand the credit – along with sweeteners for businesses – but it’s not clear if the Senate will act.We still do not know exactly how the coronavirus developed. There is a remarkable amount of circumstantial evidence that points to some kind of lab leak in Wuhan, China.But serious questions remain about when and how researchers in China first discovered the existence of the coronavirus. The lack of transparency by the Chinese government has fed the so-called lab leak theory.The scientific mystery remains. And the national security mystery remains too. In June, CNN reported the US Intelligence committee is still split over whether the virus developed in a lab or in the wild, and no one trusts China to share all of the information.That kind of mistrust is a problem, according to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization. He told CNN’s Becky Anderson in February in Dubai that the world is not ready for “Disease X,” the unknown pathogen that could bring the next pandemic.“We’re not prepared because still many of the problems we have seen during the pandemic are still there,” he said, calling on countries to do more to share information and technology."

        "text": "Former Republican presidential candidate Asa Hutchinson said Monday he will not endorse Donald Trump, his party’s presumptive nominee for president, nor would he vote for President Joe Biden in November.“I have not endorsed Donald Trump for president, and I will not do so,” the former Arkansas governor wrote in a USA Today op-ed.Hutchinson, who was critical of Trump on the presidential campaign trail, argued in his op-ed that the former president had “disqualified” himself on January 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters attacked the US Capitol, and that Trump “continues to undermine our democracy by defending the actions of that dark day.”“Regretfully, Donald Trump has redefined the GOP in his image and has put personal ego above the common good,” Hutchinson wrote.He also accused Trump of embracing Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukrainian people, leaning into isolationism by “abandoning” NATO and US leadership on the world stage, and endorsing “economic protectionism” with his plan to impose tariffs on US allies and adversaries.“These ideas are not Republican principles but anathema to the success story conservative leaders have built over the last 50 years,” the former governor wrote.But Hutchinson also said he will not vote for Biden, arguing that the Democratic incumbent’s “weak” border policies, “poor” economic record and “slow growth” energy policy don’t “justify reelection.”Hutchinson launched his campaign for president in April 2023, highlighting his extensive government service and his two terms as the conservative governor of Arkansas. He was one of the few Republican presidential hopefuls who spoke out against Trump, but he failed to attract significant support over the other Trump alternatives.He ended his campaign in January and later endorsed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for president. Haley, who became Trump’s last-standing major challenger, exited the GOP primary after Trump’s dominating performance in the Super Tuesday contests earlier this month.Hutchinson is not the only former GOP presidential candidate who has said he cannot endorse Trump.Last week, Trump’s former vice president, Mike Pence, offered a stunning repudiation of his onetime ticket mate, telling Fox News: “Donald Trump is pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years. That’s why I cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump in this campaign.”"

Trump was charged with falsifying business records for allegedly covering up the reimbursement of those payments to influence the election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies the affair.Trump’s attorneys have argued the release of the documentary should be grounds to dismiss the indictment or delay the trial since its release comes one week before jury selection was scheduled to begin on Monday. They said some of Daniels’ statements, including concerning threats of violence, would be prejudicial to Trump.They blame prosecutors for not alerting them about the documentary.“Clifford asserts on the video trailer that ‘sh*t got real’ when President Trump got the Republican nomination, claims that she was ‘terrified,’ reads highly prejudicial threats not connected to President Trump, such as a random person stating, ‘you just signed your death warrant,’” Trump’s attorneys wrote, referring to Daniels by her real name, Stephanie Clifford.The release, they added, “reflects an egregious effort to prejudice the venue, which the People were undoubtedly aware of but failed to disclose, and requires a dismissal” or delay of the trial date.They’ve also asked the judge to preclude Daniels from testifying.Judge Juan Merchan agreed to push back the trial until at least April 15 over the late production of documents from prosecutors in the Cohen case – unrelated to the claims concerning Daniels. He has not ruled on the Daniels-related matters."

        "text": "Former President Donald Trump’s team is in discussions with Paul Manafort, his 2016 campaign chairman whom he later pardoned, to potentially help with the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, three sources familiar with the ongoing conversations told CNN.Manafort, who was one of several individuals who ran Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, was pardoned by Trump after being found guilty of several financial crimes in 2018.One source indicated that Manafort would be helping with fundraising around the July convention but noted that no final decisions had been made.Trump has told allies he wanted to bring Manafort back into the fold, but it was unclear in what capacity.The Washington Post first reported Manafort’s potential involvement with Trump’s 2024 election effort.Manafort spent close to two years of a 7.5-year sentence in prison for bank and tax fraud, illegal foreign lobbying and witness tampering conspiracies before being released in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic, spending the remainder of his sentence under home confinement prior to his pardon.The former Trump campaign staffer was found to have committed financial fraud in 2019. Those convictions were obtained by special counsel Robert Mueller as he investigated Manafort’s alleged collusion with the Russian government in 2016 – though Manafort’s crimes did not relate directly to his work as Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman.As part of his plea deal with Mueller’s team, he agreed to cooperate with the prosecutors on the then-special counsel’s team – before lying during those interview sessions.Manafort, a Reagan-era political operator, was largely credited with securing Trump the Republican nomination in 2016. His deep ties in the Republican establishment and tireless organizing to win the GOP delegate fight helped propel Trump over his primary rivals at the time.But he was pushed aside months before the general election in favor of other Trump loyalists and amid reports of his financial connections to pro-Russia Ukrainian politicians. Even after resigning as chairman of Trump’s campaign, he was still involved with the former president’s transition to the White House, CNN reported at the time."

        "title": "GOP nominee to run North Carolina public schools called for violence against Democrats, including executing Obama and Biden",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The Republican nominee for superintendent overseeing North Carolina’s public schools and its $11 billion budget has a history marked by extreme and controversial comments, including sharing baseless conspiracy theories and frequent calls for the execution of prominent Democrats.Michele Morrow, a conservative activist who last week upset the incumbent Superintendent of Public Instruction in North Carolina’s Republican primary, expressed support in 2020 for the televised execution of former President Barack Obama and suggested killing then-President-elect Joe Biden.In other comments on social media between 2019 and 2021 reviewed by CNN’s KFile, Morrow made disturbing suggestions about executing prominent Democrats for treason, including Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Hillary Clinton, Sen. Chuck Schumer and other prominent people such as Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates.“I prefer a Pay Per View of him in front of the firing squad,” she wrote in a tweet from May 2020, responding to a user sharing a conspiracy theory who suggested sending Obama to prison at Guantanamo Bay. “I do not want to waste another dime on supporting his life. We could make some money back from televising his death.”In another post in May 2020, she responded to a fake Time Magazine cover that featured art of Obama in an electric chair asking if he should be executed.“Death to ALL traitors!!” Morrow responded.In yet another comment, Morrow suggested in December 2020 killing Biden, who at that time was president-elect, and has said he would ask Americans to wear a mask for 100 days.“Never. We need to follow the Constitution’s advice and KILL all TRAITORS!!! #JusticeforAmerica,” she wrote.CNN reached out to Morrow and her campaign multiple times but did not receive a response. Following publication of this story, Morrow defended her previous tweets, claiming Obama committed treason.Last Tuesday, Morrow defeated Catherine Truitt, the incumbent North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction, in the Republican primary. Morrow, a registered nurse and grassroots activist who homeschooled her children, ran on a platform of supporting parental rights and opposing critical race theory.As superintendent, Morrow would oversee the state’s public school system and help set educational priorities, manage the school system’s budgets, and work with the state’s Board of Education to set and implement curriculum standards. Her website lists endorsements by “conservative school boards” but remains light on changes she’d make if elected.Morrow has in the past called public schools “socialism centers” and “indoctrination centers.”In a campaign speech in February, Morrow advocated for a constitutional amendment to abolish the state Board of Education, which sets policies and procedures for public schools in the state. Doing away with the board would put direct control over the state’s education agenda under the superintendent and the state legislature, which is currently controlled by Republicans.“I’d like to see a constitutional amendment to get rid of the state Board of Education,”she said. “If the superintendent is elected and works under the legislature - knowing that they’re accountable to the legislature to oversee the DPI and to oversee and have impact into the superintendents in the 115 districts, I think we would be so much better off because you don’t have all these extra people right in mix.”Morrow has espoused a wide range of extreme views on social media in recent years. Many of her past extreme comments were made on her now-dormant personal Twitter account — which is separate from her campaign account.Morrow also promoted QAnon slogans and tweeted that the actor Jim Carrey was “… likely searching for adrenochrome” – a reference to a conspiracy theory shared by QAnon believers that celebrities harvest and drink the blood of children to prolong their own lives. Media Matters, a left-leaning publication, was first to report the QAnon tweets.All together, Morrow tweeted “WWG1WGA” – the slogan that stands for “where we go one, we go all” and is commonly associated with the QAnon conspiracy – more than seven times in 2020.Central to QAnon lore is the notion of the “Storm,” a belief there will be a day when thousands will purportedly be arrested, subjected to military tribunals, and face mass executions for their alleged crimes, with Donald Trump leading efforts to dismantle them alongside other QAnon “patriots.”Morrow’s post about publicly executing Obama was just one of numerous she has made espousing carrying out violent fantasies against Democrats.On Twitter, the platform now known as X, and on the now-defunct conservative Twitter alternative, Parler, Morrow used the hashtag “#DeathtoTraitors” a combined 12 times – usually in relation to prominent Democrats.“Obama did it. Hillary did it. Schiff did it. Comey did it. Yates did it. Holder did it. Clapper did it. Gates did it. Fauci did it. Time for #WeThePeople to DO IT and #DrainTheSwamp!!!!! #NoJusticeNoCountry #DeathToTraitors #ProsecuteThemNow #TakeBackAmerica .@dbongino #KAG,” she wrote in one tweet from May 2020, referring to “sedition.”In another post from July 2019, Morrow targeted Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar and other Democrats, suggesting their impending death for unspecified “treason.”“@IlhanMN and her other law-hating Dems must be getting a little nervous. Are they just realizing the punishment for treason is death?!?” Morrow wrote.In a post on Parler, Morrow used the hashtag #deathtotraitors in discussing the Democratic governors of North Carolina and New York, Cooper and Cuomo. Morrow publicized her Parler handle in a tweet and CNN found the deleted Parler posts on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.“Our Communist sympathizer, Comrade Cooper, has the same plans for NC!Expose them NOW!Can we we see the CCP list, @SecPompeo??? #PrisonTimeforFederalCrimes #DeathToTraitors #FreeOurCitizens,” Morrow wrote in 2020, discussing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.In other posts on Parler, Morrow shared posts from other users and a QAnon account about locking up Democrats at Guantanamo Bay and prisons.Morrow’s ire also went beyond Democrats, including one post in December 2020 calling for putting Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia in prison after he certified Georgia’s results for Joe Biden in that year’s presidential election.In other comments, Morrow repeatedly shared the false claim that Obama was Muslim, called Islam evil, and expressed belief in a conspiracy theory that tens of thousands of Chinese troops were stationed in Canada to invade the United States to help Joe Biden become president.“Tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers are already in Canada and probably Mexico waiting for orders to invade,” she wrote on January 8, 2021.In another post from September 2019, Morrow said that Barack Obama (referred to as B.O.) was a puppet for the “Deep State” and the “Muslim movement” and suggested he pay the highest penalty for his alleged crimes.“B.O. was a puppet for the Deep State and the Muslim movement to destroy our Constitutional Republic. We cannot give up until ALL the guilty pay the highest penalty for their crimes. We will lose our country #SAVEOURNATION #JusticeForAll #TraitorsMustPay“The DEEP STATE globalists and Muslim extremists, intent on destroying America, placed Omar and MANY others into our govt. #WakeUpAmerica #IslamIsEvil #ToleranceIsDeadly,” she wrote in January 2020.In one post, Morrow said Muslims should be banned from elected office in the United States and said Rep. Omar, who came to the United States as a refugee, should, “head back to Somalia.”This story has been updated with a tweet from Michele Morrow referencing this story after publication."

        "title": "Biden has shelved the age issue – for now",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Not even presidents can reverse time, so there’s only so much Joe Biden can do to defuse one of his top general election liabilities – his advanced age.But Biden, 81, appears to be in far better shape on this question than he was a week ago – and not just because he charged past the magic number of convention delegates needed to clinch the 2024 Democratic nomination on Tuesday evening.The president’s vigorous State of the Union address has partly reset the political narrative and is still delivering dividends. The prime-time look at Biden in his element, dominating the stage, offered a robust counter-image to the one Americans have sometimes seen – of a bewildered statesman who cited phone chats with dead European leaders and confused Mexico and Egypt in a news conference meant to fix the age issue.That debacle was prompted by special counsel Robert Hur’s report, which lifted the threat of Biden facing criminal charges for retaining classified documents after his vice presidency but described him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” That characterization incited a furor and reignited debate over whether the president should step aside so a younger Democrat could carry the fight to presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump.At one point in that angry appearance, Biden raged, “How in the hell dare he raise that?” referring to Hur’s depiction of his struggle to remember exactly when his son Beau died.The reality of the interview now appears somewhat different than portrayed either by Hur or Biden or spun by Republican and Democratic operatives and reflected in media coverage.The 258-page transcript released Tuesday shows Biden occasionally flustered and searching for dates. But the totality of the encounter doesn’t support Republican claims of advanced cognitive decline. The transcript, however, also undercuts claims by Democrats that Hur, a Trump-appointed former US attorney in Maryland, was a raging partisan out to trip up the president.In the interview, Biden speaks at length and fluently, easily recalling in-depth details about his vice presidency, family life and lore. He digresses into discussing his power as a eulogist, waxes lyrical about his beloved Delaware and even seems to be trying to sell Hur on the merits of his administration’s foreign policy.While it may be a disappointment for Republicans looking for a smoking gun, the transcript will be a goldmine for future historians.As Hur probes for details about document storage, the president comes across as helpful and sometimes like the windy old politician who knows how to filibuster like only a long-time senator can. He’s fiercely proud of his family, his home, and is in love with his wife, first lady Jill Biden, and hopes Hur didn’t find “risqué” photos of her. He unleashes long perorations on his cabinets and officer furniture and says he’s something of an amateur architect. The exchanges about the death of Beau from brain cancer are hard to read. But there’s also pure comedy – like when Biden boasts about his prowess with a bow and arrow during a trip to Mongolia and said of the country’s prime minister: “The poor son of a b*tch couldn’t pull it back.”Maybe Hur wasn’t trying to be funny when he told Biden at the start that he wanted some background but that “we will not be asking you to take us back to Scranton.” Yet anyone familiar with Biden’s veneration of his life story as a scrappy kid in the blue collar Pennsylvania city would have struggled to stifle a chuckle.For all the diversions, there’s little evidence in the interview transcript that Biden isn’t fit or capable of serving in the Oval Office – a key charge at the center of Trump’s searing general election campaign.Hur defended his finding in a highly politicized House hearing on Tuesday, where he also declined to give credence to Republican claims that Biden’s mental faculties are diminished. Wisconsin Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, for instance, asked him: “Mr. Hur, based on your report, did you find that the president was senile?” Hur answered: “I did not. That conclusion does not appear in my report.”The fact that his GOP interrogators chose to focus more on Biden’s and Trump’s differing consequences for holding classified documents – Biden was not charged and Trump was – may suggest they understand that, for now, at least, taking pot shots at Biden’s age has lost some potency. (Trump has pleaded not guilty to federal charges, brought by a different special counsel, related to his hoarding of documents at Mar-a-Lago.)Similar GOP messaging confusion was evident after Thursday’s State of the Union address. Republicans went into the event slamming Biden as doddering and aged. They came out of complaining that he was too amped up and too loud.Had the annual televised address been a total disaster, with Biden providing more highlight reels of what Alabama Sen. Katie Britt called a “dithering and diminished” figure in her lampooned GOP response, this week could have been a rough one for Biden. He would, for instance, have added fuel to GOP attacks in Tuesday’s hearing and offered evidence for Hur’s assessment of his memory. Instead, his performance last week, which has been followed this week by several upbeat campaign events in swing states, has countered the narrative of decline that conservative media has spent months building with its Biden blooper tapes.One person not ready to let the age issue go is Trump, who himself is 77. He put out a video of Biden stumbling on the steps of Air Force One and falling off his bike, seeking to revive his long-term narrative about his rival. The former president’s focus on Biden’s age reflects the fact that one good week will not change a harsh reality of the coming eight months. Any sign of fragility on the campaign trail will revive doubts over Biden’s ability not just to serve but to beat Trump when he’s underwater in multiple swing states and on key electoral issues.Biden has implicitly acknowledged this will continue to be a vulnerability. In an ad released over the weekend, he said, “I’m not a young guy, that’s no secret. But here’s the deal, I understand how to get things done for the American people.” Biden’s supporters often complain that there is a double standard on age since Trump is not far behind Biden in years. But the ex-president’s bombast and bluster tends to undercut that criticism – something the Biden camp acknowledges by sometimes implicitly arguing that while the president is old, he’s not a wild threat to the rule of law and the Constitution like his predecessor.Outside Washington and the self-contained world of politics and campaigns, concerns about Biden’s age will be hard to shift. Multiple polls show that most Americans believe Biden is too old to run. A New York Times/Siena College survey before the State of the Union found that even a majority of those who voted for Biden in 2020 think he’s too old to be effective. The age issue was rumbling long before it became a major campaign issue. White House claims that the media has exaggerated the anxiety underplay the genuine feeling among many voters as they mull their choice in November.Still, Biden’s age is only one issue of an election that the president wants to turn from being a referendum on his performance to a public repudiation of Trump’s effort to claim a second term devoted to retribution and revenge. A slight uptick in inflation in new government data Tuesday, meanwhile, underscored the president’s vulnerability in the face of economic factors outside his control. And the more a restive world plays into Trump’s caricature of a planet careening toward World War III, the harder the campaign may become for Biden.However, after a successful State of the Union address and after escaping Hur’s inquiry in better shape than had seemed possible a few weeks ago, the Biden campaign registered a milestone on the night that the president officially claimed the nomination, albeit without serious challenge.“It’s a ‘turn the page’ moment,” a campaign official told CNN’s MJ Lee. “The transcript is out. The hearing is done. Trump is going to continue to be dogged by indictments on the documents, but for us – it’s effectively done.”But after showing he’s in command, Biden must keep it up for eight more months on a grueling campaign trial, against an unchained opponent who’s still a couple years short of 80."

        "title": "They voted for the bill that could ban TikTok. They also actively use the app.",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Democratic Rep. Jeff Jackson struck a breezy tone as he talked about the State of the Union while sitting in the kitchen where he films several of his TikTok videos.“It’s a little risky to talk about the State of the Union from your kitchen these days, but let’s give it a shot,” the North Carolina Democrat said before discussing how the lights in the room were three times brighter than normal that night, the bet he made about how many heckles there would be among members of Congress and looking up at his wife, Marisa, give a standing ovation when Biden mentioned IVF, as they had gone through the procedure twice.It’s that kind of casualness and relatability that has resonated with TikTok users and led to the congressman gaining a significant following of more than two million followers over the past nearly three years. Beyond alluding to the criticism Alabama Sen. Katie Britt received for her delivery of the GOP’s rebuttal to Biden’s address, Jackson often shares what he’s experienced through his first term in Congress.Whether it’s the “fake anger” he’s noticing among voices in Congress or being “toast” during the redrawing of North Carolina’s congressional map last year, Jackson often describes current affairs and incorporates videos, like of him boxing, to paint a picture of how he plans “to go after political corruption” if he becomes attorney general.Still, the congressman was among the 352 members who voted in favor of the legislation that could lead to a nationwide ban of the app, which he has amassed 36 million likes on. Since the passage of the bill in the House, TikTok users have flooded the comment section in his recent videos, criticizing Jackson for his recent vote and vowing to unfollow him. The number of followers Jackson has appears to have gone down in recent weeks.Jackson is not the only House representative who has both taken advantage of the popular app and voted for the bill that could ban it. Some of these representatives actively use the app to boost their campaigns, while others use it for office communications. Democratic Reps. Colin Allred of Texas, Adam Schiff of California and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan have all used TikTok as they each campaign for the Senate this year.Jackson took to the app hours later to explain his vote, saying, “I don’t think TikTok is going to be banned.” The video received several negative comments and has since been deleted on TikTok (it remains on X).“TikTok may be sold to another company, but it will continue to operate,” Jackson said in the video. “The bill that just passed the House was about telling TikTok they have to sell to another company.”He also said in a statement, “I’ve said repeatedly that ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, needs to sell their shares. The best-case scenario is that TikTok continues to operate but is no longer owned - and potentially controlled - by an adversarial government. That’s exactly what this legislation does.”In an apology video on Saturday, Jackson stated “I did not handle this situation well from top to bottom and that is why I have been completely roasted on this app over the last 48 hours.” He went on to give “more of an explanation” about the bill and his vote in favor of it.“When I was reading the bill, the part I agreed with was the part that tries to force a sale because I figured this would just be a better app if we didn’t have to worry about the stuff that comes with it being potentially controlled by an adversarial government,” he said.“The part I didn’t like was the part that threatens a ban. Half the country is on this app. It has become a force for good in the lives of millions of people. So I weighed those two things and the reason I voted for it was because I genuinely believe the chance of a ban is practically zero for a lot of reasons,” Jackson continued.The congressman’s vote in favor of the TikTok bill comes freshly after a win in the Democratic primary for attorney general of North Carolina last week; Jackson will next face off against a fellow congressman, Republican Dan Bishop, in November.Some members who voted in favor of the bill believe the US should be able to regulate the technology.Although state and federal lawmakers have already banned TikTok from government-owned devices, efforts continue to create new legislation that would regulate the app as US officials have warned for years that China’s intelligence laws could enable Beijing to snoop on the user information TikTok collects.“This is a very close issue and I do not take lightly any adverse action toward a service that is used by over half of all Americans,” Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, whose office uses the app to share information, said in a news release last week. “But the United States has a right to regulate a social media company controlled by the hostile Chinese authoritarian regime that exercises broad power over American discourse and popular culture.”While Schiff said he does not support a ban on TikTok while there are less restrictive means available, he said the legislation gives “the administration the leverage and authority to require divestiture.”“The Chinese Communist Party’s ability to exploit private user data and to manipulate public opinion through TikTok present serious national security concerns,” Schiff, who recently advanced to the November election in the California Senate race, said in a statement. “For that reason, I believe that divestiture presents the best option to preserve access to the platform, while ameliorating these risks.”The legislative action toward TikTok stems from national security concerns related to its Chinese parent company ByteDance. If enacted, the bill would give TikTok roughly five months to separate from ByteDance, or else app stores in the United States would be prohibited from hosting the app on their platforms.The bill would need to pass in both the House and the Senate before it would be sent to the president to be signed into law. Though it passed in the House with bipartisan support, the legislation’s fate is less than clear in the Senate, where there is no companion bill. President Joe Biden, whose campaign has its own TikTok account, said he would sign the bill if it makes it to his desk.A few of the representatives who voted in favor of the bill have emphasized that it is not meant to be a ban of TikTok.“The Chinese government remains the most active and persistent cyber threat to the United States,” Allred, who is challenging Sen. Ted Cruz, said in a news release on Wednesday. “This is not a ban, instead it creates a system to preserve TikTok and protect our freedoms and privacy by requiring ByteDance to fully divest in TikTok.”Other representatives have acknowledged their staff’s use of the app. Slotkin said in a statement on X, “It’s important to recognize that I benefit from TikTok’s ability to reach” Michiganders.“I’m a candidate, as you said, for Senate,” Slotkin, who is running to succeed Sen. Debbie Stabenow, told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell on Thursday. “Most of us want TikTok to be available, right? You don’t think I have nieces and nephews and staff who are on TikTok who love it? Of course. I don’t want to ban it. I just don’t want the Chinese government controlling that data.”But TikTok said they hope the Senate will realize the impact of the app and blasted House lawmakers’ fast-tracking of the bill.“This process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: it’s a ban. We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.Annie Wu Henry, a digital strategist who charged Sen. John Fetterman’s presence on the app during his 2022 campaign, said TikTok creates an accessible and equitable space for individuals, politicians, organizations and activists to get their voice heard and have a platform. She said the online space is increasingly more important and is an additional tool that can be used to organize people, raise money, communicate information and for brand and name awareness.“It’d be a loss of a place that people can organize, a place that people can use their voice, a place that people can also provide their public opinion,” Henry said.Along with the House members who have hopped on the app for campaigning purposes, several members use the app through their office to discuss the latest news and what they are working on in Congress.Of those members who use it to share what their offices are up to, Democratic Reps. Sean Casten of Illinois, Greg Landsman of Ohio, Wiley Nickel of North Carolina, Pascrell and Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico voted in favor of the bill that could potentially ban TikTok in the US.Landsman said he uses most social media platforms to “communicate to constituents about the services that they may be eligible for, how we can be helpful, legislation we’re working on. Just being as transparent and accountable as we possibly can.”The Democratic congressman said if TikTok is banned, he will continue to use the social media platforms that aren’t banned, but said, “I don’t think that’s what’s going to happen here.”“It’s really a sell TikTok, not ban TikTok bill. So this gives the administration and those involved, that are much closer to this, the leverage that they need to get this thing solved,” he said.Henry said what concerns her is down the line, “it kind of opens the flood gate for there to be banning of other apps because what if something else pops up? Is it going to be banned because people have concerns around it, or issues, or people maybe just don’t like it?”CNN has reached out to the offices of Casten, Nickel and Stansbury for comment."

        "title": "Supreme Court won’t review ruling that removed New Mexico official from office over January 6 insurrection",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The Supreme Court declined Monday to hear the appeal of a former New Mexico county commissioner who was removed from office because of his role in the January 6, 2021 insurrection – a case that was similar to the one the high court recently decided involving former President Donald Trump.Cowboys for Trump founder and convicted Capitol rioter Couy Griffin was removed from office in 2022, marking the first time an elected official was booted under the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” because of the US Capitol riot.The Supreme Court’s move means the ruling barring Griffin from office will stand.In a unanimous decision on March 4, the high court sided with Trump in a similar case. Six Colorado voters attempted to knock the former president off the ballot in that state because his remarks before the attack on the US Capitol in 2021. But the court ruled that states couldn’t do so on their own.Responsibility for enforcing the ban, the court wrote, “rests with Congress and not the states.”Griffin, unlike Trump, had already been found guilty of a January 6-related crime when he was disqualified from holding office. He was convicted of trespassing on Capitol grounds after a bench trial in March 2022. He was acquitted of a second misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct.A civil trial on the disqualification question was held later that year. A state judge ruled that January 6 was an insurrection and that Griffin violated the oath he took as a commissioner by engaging in that insurrection. Griffin was disqualified under Section 3 and was removed in September 2022.New Mexico’s top court dismissed Griffin’s appeal on procedural grounds.A prominent right-wing conspiracy theorist, Griffin was part of the Capitol insurrection mob, though he didn’t enter the building itself.He returned to national attention in June 2022 by refusing to certify the legitimate results of a primary elections in his county, citing baseless claims of election irregularities, which triggered a standoff with state election authorities.In a recent interview with CNN, Griffin slammed the process that led to his disqualification, and also criticized the similar cases against Trump.“This whole thing started on a small scale, with them coming after me, with the specific goal of bringing it up the to the big stage with Donald Trump,” Griffin said. “I was the test case.”This story has been updated with additional details."

        "title": "Pelosi praises Schumer’s speech on Israel, says ‘Israel’s reputation is at risk’",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s recent remarks calling for a new election in Israel “should be listened to because Israel’s reputation is at risk” as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens.Speaking to CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union,” Pelosi noted that Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in the US, was “concerned about the weakness of the Palestinian Authority and the very, very dangerous attitude of the right-wing Israeli government.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Bash earlier Sunday that Schumer’s comments were “totally inappropriate” and refused to commit to new elections.“The prime minister’s presentation proved the necessity of Chuck Schumer’s speech. Chuck Schumer’s speech was an act of courage, an act of love for Israel,” Pelosi said.Her latest comments underscore a shift in rhetoric among top American leaders in recent weeks. President Joe Biden said last week that Netanyahu was “hurting Israel more than helping Israel” and called a possible invasion of Rafah a red line, though he clarified that crossing it would not result in punitive measures against Israel.The White House and congressional Democrats are most critical of the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza as Palestinians increasingly face deadly violence in their search for aid.Pelosi said Netanyahu must “be unaware or ill-informed” of the humanitarian situation in Gaza after the prime minister claimed Israel was taking proper steps to increase aid corridors. The California Democrat called it a “very sad situation” as aid organizations warn of a famine looming in the region.A growing number of children in Gaza are dying of starvation and dehydration, according to the World Health Organization and Palestinian officials, while UNICEF says that thousands of newborns are at risk of dying of hunger in the next month. Aid agencies have accused Israel of imposing arbitrary and contradictory criteria that obstruct the entry of relief into the war-ravaged territory.“When we give assistance to a country, we insist they do not interfere with our giving humanitarian aid,” Pelosi said.Pelosi also criticized Netanyahu for attacking Schumer over his suggestion that Israel hold new elections, considering that Netanyahu has previously inserted himself into US politics.“It’s curious to me to see Netanyahu talk the way he does when he tried to interfere in American elections,” Pelosi said, referring to Netanyahu criticizing then-President Barack Obama and the Iran nuclear deal in front of the US Congress.In that 2015 address, Netanyahu framed Iran as a major terrorist threat to the US and Israel, comparing it to ISIS and North Korea. He argued that the deal then in the works to prevent the nation from gaining nuclear weapons would in fact “guarantee” that it secures them — “lots of them.”Former President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018.Trump attacked Schumer on Sunday for about calling for new elections in Israel and went on to criticize Israel’s loyalty to Democrats.“The Democrats are very bad for Israel. Israel sticks with them. I guess Israel’s loyal maybe to a fault because they stick with these guys,” he said in an interview on Fox News.Trump briefly mused that maybe Schumer had “forgotten” the lives lost in Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, before pushing aside that suggestion and saying the New York Democrat is simply making a political calculation.Trump briefly mused that maybe Schumer had “forgotten” the lives lost in the Hamas attacks on October 7, before pushing back on that suggestion and saying the New York Democrat is simply making a political calculation.“He doesn’t forget it. He looks at, ‘Where do I get more votes?’ And I guess he’s seeing, you know, the Palestinians and he’s seeing the marches, and they are big. And he says, ‘I want to go that way instead of Israel,’” Trump said.Trump said his message to Netanyahu would be, “You have to finish it up and do it quickly and get back to the world of peace.” He again vowed to bring peace to Ukraine and the Middle East if elected president.Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, meanwhile, toed a middle ground on Sunday’s “State of the Union” when discussing Schumer’s recent comments.“I agree with Leader Schumer’s comments regarding the necessity of reducing civilian casualties in Gaza,” Schiff said. “I wouldn’t go as far as the leader in setting out the timing of elections.”"

        "title": "Emails show how a right-wing group steers GOP leaders on major policy issues",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "When Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft jumped into the state’s gubernatorial race last year, the Republican vowed to tackle a slew of culture war issues, promising to fight the “woke politics” of “left-wing” banks and touting how he used his position to enact a regulation targeting those financial firms.Ashcroft also said candidates shouldn’t focus on issues that let the one percent “force their beliefs on 99 percent of the population.”While Ashcroft positioned himself as a champion for working class voters, emails obtained by CNN and the progressive watchdog group Documented show that he was steered toward adopting his “anti-woke” investment regulation by a little-known, right-wing think tank with deep ties to conservative billionaires. The communications show that officials with the Foundation for Government Accountability suggested regulatory language to Ashcroft and even wrote an op-ed article that Ashcroft published in a national conservative magazine under his own name.The emails not only reveal FGA’s influence over Ashcroft, they offer a snapshot of the group’s growing influence across the country, particularly in red states. And that influence can carry a high cost for workers and taxpayers.The “anti-woke” investment measures have cost states hundreds of millions of dollars in additional investment fees and can lead to smaller returns for public employee retirement plans. One study estimated a 2021 Texas law would cost taxpayers up to $500 million in higher interest rates just on bonds sold in the first eight months after the law passed. Another study calculated that the law cost local governments $270 million a year in added fees, resulting in an annual $668 million in lost economic activity and thousands of full-time jobs.Along with attacking “woke” investing, FGA has worked with legislators and elected officials to push for laws to deregulate child labor, stop Medicaid expansion and slash food stamps, among other initiatives. Since the 2020 presidential election, the group also has played a key role in the push to advance voting restrictions and other legislation pitched as promoting election integrity in Republican states – claiming more than 70 such policy wins across the country in 2022 alone.In Wyoming, a GOP state senator forwarded an FGA draft bill to Secretary of State Chuck Gray that would prohibit sending out unsolicited absentee ballot request forms. “This is great!” Gray enthusiastically replied. It sailed through the legislature before the state’s Republican governor scuttled the measure, angering Gray. “The Governor just vetoed the absentee ballot request form bill. Very troubling,” he wrote to an FGA contact in an email.The group’s communications with Ashcroft and Gray give a rare glimpse into how billionaire megadonors use think tanks like FGA to advance their causes out of public view. Federal tax laws allow such donors to channel millions of dollars anonymously, through nonprofit foundations, to activist organizations that lobby for and work behind the scenes to enact legislation that reflects partisan political goals.Ashcroft didn’t respond to queries from CNN. Gray emailed a statement that didn’t respond to specific questions but read, in part, “I routinely ask for feedback from individuals and organizations to explore common-sense solutions to problems facing our state.” He said that includes solutions aimed at “election integrity measures.”FGA enjoys tax-exempt status as a charitable organization. It received more than $44 million from six conservative foundations tied to billionaire donors from 2013 through 2022, the most recent year for which tax records are available. Those foundations also have financed much of the push to tighten voting laws and spread election disinformation across the country since the 2020 election.But even though FGA’s tax-exempt status requires it not to engage in “substantial” lobbying, the group has closely coordinated with a variety of state officials and legislators to advance their causes.Its push in Missouri shows how that approach works.Last spring, before Missouri legislators considered bills to curb “woke” investing, FGA officials were already in frequent contact on the issue with at least two of the state’s top officials – including Ashcroft.Emails show the group strategized with the secretary of state’s office for weeks leading up to Ashcroft proposing his own such rule last January. FGA later cited Missouri’s rule as a model in a draft memo titled, “What Secretaries of State Can Do to Challenge the Threat of ESG.”ESG refers to a financial strategy that considers the environmental, social and governance effects of an investment, rather than solely the potential profit. Dubbed “woke investing” by its critics on the right, it has become a wedge issue in modern culture wars. Conservative activist groups have gotten lawmakers and officials in 17 states to pass investment laws to protect fossil fuel companies and gun manufacturers who might be hurt by ESG considerations. FGA has characterized the fight to stop ESG in existential terms, calling it a “far-left” plot to advance a climate and social justice agenda outside the ballot box.Ashcroft’s rule in Missouri required financial advisers and institutions to obtain written consent from clients to purchase or sell investments based on social or non-financial objectives, such as combating or considering the impact of climate change. Ashcroft said the rule was intended to serve as a template for the state legislature, where Republicans held large majorities in both chambers.But at the legislature, business interests like the Missouri Chamber of Commerce pushed back hard, and lawmakers failed to pass any anti-ESG bills. Meanwhile, Ashcroft’s collaboration with FGA carried on. The group even drafted and sent an op-ed to his staff. It criticized President Joe Biden’s veto of a GOP bill in Congress that would have prevented pension fund managers from considering factors like climate change in investment decisions, emails to Ashcroft’s office show. That op-ed was submitted nearly verbatim to the National Review, a leading conservative magazine.“Here’s the full edited version National Review sent to me, if Jay wants to give this a 30-second glance over,” an FGA official wrote to an Ashcroft staffer. The piece was published under Ashcroft’s byline the next day. He then promoted the article as part of his efforts to fight what he called “woke politics.”A week later, he announced his candidacy for governor and has made fighting “woke politics” a major theme of his campaign.Ashcroft said his rule is intended to protect investors, and that ESG policies can threaten people’s retirement money. However, nonpartisan studies have concluded that anti-ESG policies adopted in Texas drove up the cost to taxpayers of bond issuances by up to $500 million in less than a year. In Kansas, Indiana and elsewhere, anti-ESG bills were gutted after studies suggested they could cost state pension plans billions of dollars by restricting investment options.Paying more for bonds can force governments to seek revenue elsewhere – such as raising taxes or cutting public services, said Daniel Garrett, a University of Pennsylvania finance professor who co-authored a Brookings Institution study that looked at Texas. Similarly, lower returns for state pension funds can pose risks for workers and retirees.“If the returns fall, that money comes from somewhere,” said Garrett. “It’s not just magic.”In late 2022, Missouri’s then-treasurer, Scott Fitzpatrick, pulled $500 million in state pension funds from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. He accused BlackRock of forcing Exxon to cut oil and gas production by helping elect “climate radicals” onto its board. Florida pulled $2 billion from BlackRock two months after Missouri.“Kneecapping domestic energy production is a disaster waiting to happen,” Fitzpatrick, who is now the state auditor, told CNN in an interview. “Any policy that essentially seeks to drive up the cost of energy is going to affect the people of Missouri and it’s going to hit the poor people hardest.”But there’s little, if any, evidence of such kneecapping. The three “radicals” BlackRock voted to put on Exxon’s board consisted of two former oil company executives and a former US assistant Secretary of Energy. And while Exxon did cut production in 2021, it did so for the same reason as other oil companies worldwide – because of huge drops in consumer demand during the Covid-19 pandemic.Fitzpatrick told CNN that he, too, met with FGA officials to discuss the issue – and engaged with FGA allies such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and the Heritage Foundation. Both groups have produced model anti-ESG bills and held events to persuade lawmakers to take up the “anti-woke” corporate fight. Fitzpatrick said he heard from Heritage fellow Andy Puzder, the former Carls Jr. CEO, “who speaks very well about the issue and whose message I agree with.”Puzder has promoted fighting these investment policies in various venues, including at a December 2022 legislative exchange council meeting in Washington. He told lawmakers that “ESG investing is socialism in sheep’s clothing,” according to a recording first reported by the Boston public-radio station WBUR. “The challenge of your generation is ESG investing, and it’s more insidious than communism or the Nazis.”Wisconsin state Rep. Kristina Shelton, a Democrat, remembers that meeting well, because none of the lawmakers seemed to know what ESG was or what Puzder was talking about.“You could see all the attendees pull out their phones to Google what it was,” she said. “You could see in real time them being spoon-fed issues.”An ALEC spokesperson confirmed that a model bill aimed at preventing state pension funds from considering “environmental, social, political or other “non-pecuniary” considerations “is official ALEC model policy.” A Heritage Foundation spokesperson, in an email, said “we are extremely proud of our anti-ESG work and we are grateful to Mr. Puzder and everyone in the conservative movement who is standing firm in this fight.”Missouri’s legislature considered more than a dozen anti-ESG bills last year, including drafts along the lines of models promoted by FGA, Heritage and ALEC.When none passed, Ashcroft was ready.His industry-wide written-consent rule took effect in June, placing Missouri squarely at the forefront of one of several burgeoning campaigns on the right where FGA has been instrumental.While FGA accomplished its policy goal in Missouri, the backlash was swift. A Wall Street trade group sued to block Ashcroft’s regulation and taxpayers are footing the bill for his defense at the tune of an estimated $1.2 million.FGA’s lobbying group, The Opportunity Solutions Project, spearheads its efforts at the state level. Together, they have at least 65 registered lobbyists who advocate and testify on behalf of FGA’s policies in 25 states, according to a 2023 tally compiled by Documented.One policy they’ve promoted with surprising success is in rolling back child labor laws. On its website, FGA dismisses protections put in place to protect teenage workers from night shifts, excessive hours or dangerous environments as undermining “parents’ rights.” FGA founder Tarren Bragdon has defended his organization’s work by saying, “we believe parents should decide what’s best for their children.”The group drafted a far-reaching bill in Arkansas, which eliminated work permits and age verification for workers younger than 16 years old, the bill’s sponsor, GOP state Rep. Rebecca Burkes, said in a Senate hearing. Burkes represents a district in northwestern Arkansas where Tyson Foods Inc. and George’s Inc., two of the country’s largest chicken processors, are headquartered. It’s also where US Department of Labor investigators, as part of a multi-state probe, found children as young as 13 working night shifts for a sanitation contractor at plants run by Tyson and George’s Inc., and other meat or poultry companies. George’s Inc. did not respond to queries from CNN. A Tyson representative declined comment.In Missouri, FGA drafted legislation to strip child workplace protections, according to an April 2023 Washington Post report, citing emails exchanged between an Opportunity Solutions Project lobbyist and a state senator’s chief of staff.FGA also worked to loosen child labor laws in Iowa, which passed a bill last spring allowing minors as young as 14 years old to work night shifts. The US Department of Labor has said Iowa’s new law violates federal law by allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to operate dangerous power-driven machines, engage in heavy manufacturing, and work in demolition.In a podcast interview last summer, Bragdon was open about who his organization targets.“Our primary audience is those policymakers rather than activists or students or members of the general public,” said Bragdon, who started the Florida-based organization in 2011.He made those comments on The Daily Signal, a conservative news site run by The Heritage Foundation. FGA, as Bragdon described, was not fighting culture wars at the grassroots level – its work was more discreet. That low public profile has served the group well.FGA hosts Republican lawmakers at social events and at conferences, where it organizes panels around its priority issues. For instance, the opening day itinerary from FGA’s September 2022 Western Alliance conference in Park City, Utah, featured panels on election security, ESG and combating unemployment insurance fraud.It’s the type of influence peddling that has become part of a well-worn playbook for dark money organizations with deep pockets, said Sarah Bryner, research director at the nonpartisan campaign finance group OpenSecrets.“Strategically, it’s a lot easier … to engage your policy plan this way because you don’t need to try and get real people to sign on,” said Bryner. “You just need a few well-funded people. And is that problematic for democracy? Absolutely.”In an email, an FGA spokesperson did not address questions submitted by CNN but provided links to the organization’s website highlighting its policy platform on ESG, election integrity and child labor.FGA’s growing stature within Republican politics was evident on-stage recently at an event with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis barely a week after he dropped his 2024 presidential bid.Bragdon, the group’s founder, joined DeSantis and Florida House Speaker Paul Renner to call for four constitutional amendments, including requiring a federal balanced budget and term limits for members of Congress.“Our nation’s heartbeat is not in the halls of federal power, but it’s in the spirit of our people and the legacy of our states,” said Bragdon, standing behind a podium with a “Hold Washington Accountable” placard.FGA is part of a constellation of conservative groups that have laid out a roadmap for a more aggressive Trump White House, should he return to power next year. Project 2025, published by The Heritage Foundation, is a massive 900-page policy book that calls for removing tens of thousands of civil servants; gutting the FBI; weaponizing the Justice Department; breaking up the Department of Education; and vastly expanding detention camps for undocumented immigrants, amid myriad other moves.FGA also continues its push at the state level across the country to enact its policy priorities.Take the ongoing efforts to stop ESG. Legislatures in 24 states will consider at least 118 Republican anti-ESG bills this year, according to an analysis by Pleaides Strategy; many of those bills are based on models from FGA or its allies.Such measures, said Wisconsin’s Rep. Shelton, are disconnected from the average voter’s concerns.“They are funded by very wealthy donors who are interested in perpetuating the culture war for their own benefit,” Shelton told CNN. “They are creating the crises they want to address through legislation, not the crises that everyday people want them to address.”"

        "title": "Pro-Trump attorney arrested after court hearing about leaked Dominion emails",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "A pro-Trump lawyer who tried to overturn the 2020 election was arrested Monday after a court hearing about her recent leak of internal emails belonging to Dominion Voting Systems.There was an existing arrest warrant for the attorney, Stefanie Lambert, stemming from her failure to appear at recent court hearings in her separate criminal case in Michigan, where she was charged with conspiring to seize voting machines after the 2020 election.Lambert and a cadre of election deniers have disrupted one of Dominion’s many ongoing defamation lawsuits by publicly leaking thousands of the company’s internal emails in recent days, using the disclosures to resurrect false claims about voter fraud.The controversy erupted when Lambert provided the confidential Dominion documents to Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf, who has embraced conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and has used his office to hunt for supposed voter fraud against Donald Trump. In the last 24 hours, Leaf has posted more than 2,000 internal Dominion documents on his social media account.Lambert had access to the Dominion files because she represents former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who is being sued for defamation by the voting company over his 2020 election lies. As part of the case, they have access to “discovery” from Dominion, whose lawyers said they have already turned over more than a million documents.Lambert attended a hearing Monday in Byrne’s defamation case in Washington, DC, but was never seen leaving the courtroom, and questions swirled among the other attorneys about whether she had been taken into custody.The judge told Lambert to stay behind as the hearing wrapped up. The other attorneys left the courtroom, and two federal marshals then went inside and locked the doors. Lambert was never seen exiting the courtroom. The marshals declined to say whether they arrested her, and she didn’t answer messages seeking comment after the hearing.The US Marshals Service confirmed in a statement late Monday that Lambert was arrested.“The U.S. Marshals Service can confirm the arrest of Stefanie Lambert earlier this afternoon. Lambert is currently being held on local charges,” the statement said, referring to her Michigan-based criminal case.The Dominion leaks have, at least for now, diverted attention away from the alleged 2020 election-related defamation. More hearings will be needed to deal with the matter and for the judge to consider potential consequences for Lambert.Dominion’s lawyers also said in filings that company employees are already receiving new death threats in the wake of the disclosures. The messages posted online by Leaf contain names, email addresses, cell phone numbers and office addresses of Dominion employees.During the at-times testy hearing Monday, Magistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya peppered Lambert with sharp questions about the disputed Dominion materials. The judge ordered that Lambert be restricted from accessing the database containing the Dominion documents.“I will deal with the why later – but for now, I need to preserve the status quo,” Upadhyaya said, adding that “we need to prevent any future dissemination.”The judge said there would be a future hearing to determine whether Lambert violated a court order by leaking the Dominion files – and that Byrne would need to appear and answer questions. Dominion wants Lambert removed from the case and suggested in court Monday that she might have committed a crime by disseminating the files to Leaf.Lambert, Leaf and Byrne have claimed in court filings and public statements that the documents they disclosed contain evidence that Serbian nationals meddled in the 2020 election at Dominion’s request.“As has been public for years, Dominion has a small staff presence in Serbia, but any allegation that Dominion employees anywhere tried to interfere with any election is flatly false,” a Dominion spokesperson told CNN after the hearing.During the hearing, Lambert admitted that she gave the materials to Leaf, though she said she was allowed to because she was reporting a crime to “law enforcement.” She also called on Congress to investigate her claim that “foreign nationals” interfered with the 2020 election, which the US Intelligence Community has said was the most secure ever.“I did turn the documents over to law enforcement,” Lambert told the judge.Dominion blasted Lambert and Byrne in court filings before the hearing, saying their claims of Serbian meddling in the US election were “xenophobic” and noting that Lambert was nearly sanctioned for her role in a frivolous, conspiracy-laden election lawsuit.“It has been nearly four years – when does it stop?” Dominion lawyer Davida Brook said Monday in court, where she accused Lambert and Byrne of “using these lawsuits to spread yet more lies.”Dominion is suing several other pro-Trump figures who peddled similar lies about the 2020 election, including former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell and right-wing cable networks Newsmax and One America News. Dominion settled a defamation suit against Fox News last year for $787 million in the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history.This story and headline have been updated with additional developments."

        "title": "Russia undermining relationship of critical West African ally with the US, officials say",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "A critical US partner in northwest Africa is turning toward Russia amid warnings from the top US commander in the continent that the Russians are trying to “take over” the entire Sahel region of Africa.Niger, which has served as a crucial foothold for US counterterrorism operations in the region for nearly a decade, announced Saturday that it was ending the accord that has allowed US military personnel and civilian staff to operate in the country since 2014.The announcement came days after a tense meeting between Niger’s military junta, which seized power in a July 2023 coup, and US diplomatic and military officials including Gen. Michael Langley, commander of US Africa Command, and Celeste Wallander, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, defense officials told CNN. In that meeting, the US delegation expressed concern about the escalating Russian military presence in Niger, officials said, and particularly about the future of Air Base 101 in Niger’s capital and whether it will be ceded to the Russians, officials said.The discussion angered the junta leaders, who felt like they were being lectured to, despite the US cutting off much of its military and foreign assistance to Niger late last year following the coup.“When it comes to choosing diplomatic, strategic and military partners, the government of Niger regrets the willingness of the American delegation to deny the sovereign people of Niger the right to choose its partners and the types of partnerships likely to help it to truly fight terrorism, even though the United States of America has unilaterally decided to suspend all cooperation between our two countries,” Col. Maj. Amadou Abdramane, a Nigerien military spokesman, said in a statement Saturday, adding that the US delegation had a “condescending attitude” toward the Nigeriens.Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed on Monday that the US delegation “expressed concern over Niger’s potential relationships with Russia” as well as with Iran.“We raised our concerns in a direct and frank manner,” she said.The intensifying military cooperation between Russia and Niger is central to the dispute between the US and the Nigerien junta, officials said. Russia and Niger agreed to strengthen their military ties in January, Russia’s Defense Ministry said at the time.Still, while US counterterrorism operations and training with the Nigerien military largely paused after the coup, the junta did not ask the US to leave, even after kicking out French troops and cutting remaining ties with the EU in late 2023.Several of the junta leaders have worked with and been trained by the US as part of the US’ security cooperation with the country over the years. And the Pentagon has been eager to keep a force presence in the country, with many administration officials believing it is vital to efforts to tackle terrorism in the region and arguing that it’s feasible even amid the political turmoil there.Now, however, there is concern among US military officials that with Russia’s increasing presence in Niger, the Kremlin has established another foothold in the Sahel region and the West is losing its influence, a military source with knowledge of the situation said.Langley, the AFRICOM commander, told lawmakers this month that the US has been “drowned out” by Russian disinformation across Africa in previous years, leading to Russia’s success in stoking “a lot of the instability across the Sahel.”He added that both Russia and China “want that ground. They want power projection capabilities. … But I think at [an] accelerated pace, the Russian Federation is really trying to take over Central Africa as well as the Sahel.”State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Saturday that the US remains in touch with the junta, which calls itself the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland, or CNSP.“We are aware of the statement from the CNSP in Niger, which follows frank discussions at senior levels in Niamey this week about our concerns with the CNSP’s trajectory,” Miller said in a statement. “We are in touch with the CNSP and will provide further updates as warranted.”It is not yet clear whether the military junta in Niger will actually force the US military to leave the country, where US forces have conducted anti-terror operations and trained the Nigerien military since 2014.If the US were forced to withdraw, counterterrorism efforts across the region could take a hit, officials said. US drone flights out of an air base in Agadez, Niger, have given the US the ability to monitor threats in the Sahel region from a relatively close and stable position, especially as violent terror organizations have carried out a growing number of attacks in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso.Officials are also concerned that withdrawing the approximately 650 US troops stationed in Niger could leave a vacuum that Islamist militants and Russian mercenaries, including what’s left of the Wagner Group, would try to exploit.Russia has kept its sights on Niger as the US-Nigerien relationship has deteriorated. In December, the Kremlin reopened its embassy in neighboring Burkina Faso, positioning itself closer to the capital of Niger, and it has increased its effort to court Niger’s military junta, a senior intelligence official told CNN.Part of the appeal for Niger is that Russia can offer to sell its own weapons and equipment without the same conditions to respect human rights and abide by international law that the US calls for, the official said. And, for a country looking for an immediate supply of military hardware, Russia is able to sell its weapons much faster than the United States. In return, Russia is profiting off the region’s natural resources, another official said, including the gold mines in Niger.Abdramane, the Nigerien military spokesman, said Saturday that Russia “is a partner with which Niger deals on a state-to-state basis, in accordance with military cooperation agreements signed with the previous government, to acquire military equipment necessary to its fight against the terrorists who have claimed thousands of innocent Nigerian victims under the indifferent eye of much of the international community.”The US-Nigerien relationship has gone downhill quickly. Late last year, the US believed the junta government was in a “better place,” according to the senior intelligence official, and was refocusing on countering the rise of violent extremist organizations in Western Africa. The groups include ISIS-Sahel and Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam Wal-Musliminim, more commonly known as JNIM, a radical Islamist organization operating in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.A reduction in US surveillance missions in the region following the coup in Niger gave ISIS-Sahel and JNIM an opportunity to expand, the official said. But even with cooperation between the US and Niger reduced, the US military’s goal remained the same: to provide support to counter the spread of extremist organizations. Several European countries shared this goal, offering a measure of support to the junta, the official noted.But with Russia exerting more pressure and the US limited in what it can provide to Niger by law because of the coup designation, the Nigerien government has been cracking down even harder on the remaining Western military presence in the country, the sources said. US operations in the country require stricter Nigerien oversight and approval, even as the Russian presence in the country has grown increasingly visible.“Northwest Africa is getting carved up in real time by half a dozen or more countries,” one of the officials said, “and the United States is losing its foothold.”"

        "title": "Philadelphia man incarcerated as a teen is freed after more than a dozen years in prison",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "C.J. Rice is a free man, and as of Monday morning the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania officially considers him legally innocent of the crime he was convicted of in 2013.This morning, Judge James Eisenhower, in room 805 in the Criminal Justice Center in Philadelphia, granted the motion offered by District Attorney Larry Krasner to drop all charges against Rice for a 2011 shooting that sent him to prison for more than a dozen years for a crime he insists he did not and could not have physically committed.Rice’s defense counsel — Karl Schwartz and Amelia Maxfield, who successfully filed the habeas petition to get Rice out of prison and have his conviction overturned — can now pursue having his criminal record expunged of attempted murder charges.“For me personally, I’m glad to see this wrong righted,” Rice told CNN. “Can’t call it a mistake. Because the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s judicial system had at least five separate times to correct this specific situation, and chose not to act in the interest of justice. Either the Court did not review the case as the public trust endowed the court the ability to do so, or the Pennsylvania Courts did review the case and chose to allow a clear injustice to stand for as long as no one else knew what was going on. For that, the Pennsylvania Court system is blameworthy and not worthy of any confidence. Nonetheless, my comment to any DA, state, prosecutor, commonwealth who has an innocent person behind bars, let them free!”Rice’s release was more than a dozen years in the making. We told you about his case on CNN and in a cover story in The Atlantic in October 2022, which noted the many ways Rice did not have effective counsel when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sentenced him to prison for 30 to 60 years for the 2011 shooting.I was first alerted to the Rice case by my father, Dr. Theodore S. Tapper, who was Rice’s pediatrician in 2011 and who testified that he did not believe the then-17-year-old Rice was physically capable of carrying out the 2011 shooting, given that he was recovering from a separate shooting at the time and could barely walk, much less run, as the shooters were described as having done.In 2016, Rice asked my father to help him obtain medical records from his shooting that were never introduced at trial, records that showed he had a shattered pelvis at the time he was supposedly running while committing the crime. A correspondence between Rice and Dr. Tapper began, one that resulted in my father hiring attorneys to help Rice and getting me interested in covering the story.“The ruling this morning was the correct one – except C.J. never should have been charged with any crime in the first place,” Dr. Tapper told me. “He’s been locked up by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania for 12 years for a crime he had nothing to do with. The legal system churns on its own merry way and justice is seldom found. C.J. now has a chance to start building a life, 12 years of which were taken away from him without any compensation. As the title of a story about his case in The Atlantic says: This is not justice.”After we covered Rice’s story, Rice’s new attorney, Schwartz, filed a habeas petition in December 2022, which specifically argued that Rice’s attorney incompetently stipulated to evidence that provided a motive for the charged shootings. Habeas corpus is a legal principle that allows people who believe they are being held unlawfully in prison or detention to challenge it.One year later, Judge Nitza I. Quiñones Alejandro, United States district judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, granted Rice’s petition for writ of habeas corpus, finding that Rice’s “trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance,” overturning his conviction and ordering that Pennsylvania decide whether to retry him or free him within 180 days.Leading up to dropping his charges today, Krasner’s office in September acknowledged that Rice did not have adequate counsel. Krasner’s sentencing review committee, after reviewing and investigating the details of the case, recommended that Pennsylvania drop the case against Rice, believing that they could not convince a jury to believe he committed the September 25, 2011, shooting beyond a reasonable doubt, a source with the office told CNN.The DA’s office has acknowledged in recent months that the case handled by prior prosecutors was weak from the start and that there wasn’t much actual evidence tying Rice to the crime. “The thing that likely resulted in his conviction was that his defense council was so ineffective,” the DA source told CNN.It is extremely rare for a court to grant a habeas petition based on arguments dealing with a defendant’s right to adequate counsel. Previous higher courts have denied many such efforts in other cases, effectively green-lighting defense attorneys who were asleep during part of a client’s cross-examination, arrested for drunken driving on the way to court, mentally unstable, or even disbarred midway through the trial. In 2022, the US Supreme Court took steps to make it even more difficult for a defendant to claim inadequate counsel. Rice’s case getting overturned is an anomaly.“More than anything we are incredibly glad that this innocent fellow citizen has finally been granted his long-overdue exoneration and freedom,” Schwartz said in a statement. “His indomitable spirit and resolute belief that he would be exonerated throughout his unjust incarceration was awe-inspiring.”The basics of the story are as follows: Rice had been shot in September 2011, and after he was released, he saw his pediatrician, Dr. Tapper. Rice could barely walk. Days later, a separate family was shot at on a street in South Philadelphia, causing injury but thankfully no deaths or serious injury. Witnesses described one or two men who fired and then ran away.That night, no suspects were identified, even though the victims had known Rice for years. The next day, however, after police claimed they had received an anonymous tip, the police re-interviewed the victims and suddenly one picked out Rice as one of the shooters in a photo lineup. There is no recording or even detailed notes of the conversation in which she picked out Rice. The Philadelphia police have since changed procedures regarding police lineups.The court appointed Sandjai Weaver to represent Rice. Weaver, our investigation discovered, was an overworked, underpaid defense attorney who behaved incompetently and made mistake after mistake in her inadequate defense of Rice, who was convicted in 2013 and sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison for a crime in which no one was even seriously injured. Rice’s co-defendant, who had a different attorney, was acquitted in the same trial. Weaver died in 2019.Weaver “allowed things to come into evidence before the jury that shouldn’t have,” the DA source said, “namely the idea that Rice was participating in retaliation because he had been shot a couple weeks prior.”Neither the DA at the time nor the Philadelphia police had evidence connecting those two crimes, the source noted. Nor is there any evidence that Rice was a member of a local Philadelphia gang, as had also been admitted into evidence, though “any competent defense attorney would have fought vigorously against allowing that information to be put before the jury,” the DA source said. “Even the judge wondered about admitting it.”But Weaver did not object.“It was definitely prejudicial,” the source said. “We think it resulted in his conviction as opposed to his co-defendant, who was acquitted.”The only evidence against Rice was eyewitness testimony from one of the shooting victims, who since the 2013 trial has proved to be uncooperative with the DA’s office, also making any new prosecution of Rice unlikely to succeed.Though the witness knew Rice, she didn’t identify him the night of the shooting in three separate conversations with police. Weaver did not point that out in trial.Even there, however, the witness’ testimony would likely not stand up to any decent defense attorney, the DA’s office believes. The witness claimed Rice’s long braids were visibly popping out in front of his face from under a hoodie when he attacked them. But when Rice turned himself in to police at the end of September 2011, his hair was in tight, but fraying, cornrows. The DA’s office consulted with individuals who had had such hairstyles and certified hairstylists, and concluded that from photographs, his hair had been in cornrows for roughly 3 to 4 weeks when he turned himself in, the DA source said. Therefore, the witness’ memory of his long braids did not match what he looked like. (He did have long braids in the photo from the police lineup, from a months-earlier booking photo for a drug charge, it might be noted.)“If we retried him, all that evidence would come in and the jury would likely have doubts,” the DA source said.Another part of the DA’s investigation helped them arrive at this decision. Rice says that when he turned himself into police, he also turned in his cell phone, and assumed police would investigate phone records and see that he was in West Philadelphia at the time of the crime, not South Philadelphia where the shooting took place. There are no records that the police ever subpoenaed the phone records.Rice said he repeatedly asked his attorney, Weaver, to pursue such records. But she never did. But the district attorney’s office, listening to old, recorded courthouse phone call conversations, heard Rice on tape beseeching his mother to get Weaver to pursue the phone records so as to prove his alibi for the crime he did not commit.Krasner’s office also noted that Rice’s mother, Crystal Cooper, worked at the DA’s office at the time and was essentially shown the door and given another job once her son was arrested.Had this happened today, the source said the office would have offered indirect support, by making sure Rice had access to decent defense counsel, and would have reviewed the case for conflict, possibly sending it to the Pennsylvania attorney general.“That’s not how we would treat an employee today,” the source said. “Rice would of course have the presumption of innocence and we would not terminate her.”There were any number of mistakes Weaver made, but Schwartz’s petition focused on Weaver agreeing to stipulate “to an otherwise inadmissible fact that established a motive for Rice to commit the crime.”“The prosecution’s theory was that the shooting was retaliation against one of the victims for shooting Rice three weeks earlier. However, neither the police nor the prosecutor could offer any concrete evidence supporting the victim’s culpability for the earlier shooting, and the trial court was prepared to exclude the motive evidence for being more prejudicial than probative,” Schwartz wrote.“Instead, on the morning of trial, Rice’s counsel stipulated that the evidence could come in. Trial counsel’s decision to agree to that stipulation was objectively unreasonable, as the evidence was otherwise inadmissible and only could have hurt her client.”In addition to Schwartz, Maxfield and Nilam Sanghvi of the Pennsylvania Innocence Project, former Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, and attorney Ginger Anders of Munger, Tolles & Olson, LLP all joined the effort to free Rice.In response to the petition, Assistant District Attorney Peter Andrews acknowledged last fall that Rice was not provided the rights afforded under the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution, which guarantees a defendant’s right to counsel. He said that the inadequate counsel meant Rice was “due habeas relief” – a fundamental right elsewhere in the Constitution that protects against unlawful and indefinite imprisonment.Because of this, Andrews wrote, “the Commonwealth respectfully requests that the Court grant a conditional writ of habeas corpus and order that Rice be retried within 180 days or released from custody.”Those 180 days are now up, and Rice is no longer in prison after more than a dozen years.“The problems that led to C.J.’s wrongful conviction – unreliable eyewitnesses, ineffective assistance of counsel, and a poor police investigation – infect so many cases in Philadelphia and across the country,” said Maxfield, now an attorney at the Exoneration Project. “We are so happy that C.J. is home and free, and we look forward to continuing to fight for those who are not.”"

        "title": "Fact checking President Joe Biden’s State of the Union",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "President Joe Biden delivered his annual State of the Union address on Thursday. His statements were mostly accurate, a CNN fact check found, but he also made a smattering of claims that were false, misleading or lacking key context.Biden repeated his familiar misleading boast about how he had supposedly reduced the federal budget deficit, failing to explain that the decline overwhelmingly occurred because emergency pandemic spending from President Donald Trump’s tenure expired as schedule. He falsely claimed that “not anymore” would big companies be able to pay no federal income tax, overstating the impact of the 15% corporate minimum tax he signed into law.He misleadingly cited an alternative calculation from economists in his administration as if it was an actual federal tax rate paid by billionaires. And he left out context in discussing Covid-19 deaths, suggesting that far more deaths occurred during the Trump era than actually did.Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama made few specific assertions of fact during her official Republican response to Biden’s address. But Britt did falsely say, in present tense, that inflation is at a 40-year low; it no longer is.Here is a fact check of these claims and others.Biden criticized the fiscal management of former President Donald Trump during his State of the Union address, claiming, “They added more to the national debt than any presidential term in American history. Check the numbers.”Facts First: Biden’s numbers are correct; the national debt rose from about $19.9 trillion to about $27.8 trillion during Trump’s tenure, an increase of about 39% and more than in any other four-year presidential term, in part because of Trump’s major tax cuts. But it is an oversimplification to blame presidents alone for debt incurred during their tenures. Some of the Trump-era increase in the debt was due to the trillions of dollars in emergency Covid-19 pandemic relief spending that passed with bipartisan support and because of spending required by safety-net programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, that were created by previous presidents.The national debt has continued to increase under Biden. As of the day before Biden’s address, it was about $34.4 trillion, federal figures show – an increase of about 24% during his tenure.From CNN’s Katie Lobosco and Daniel DaleBiden claimed that the economy has added “800,000 new manufacturing jobs” during his administration.Facts first: Biden’s figure is correct. The US economy added 791,000 manufacturing jobs from Biden’s first full month in office, February 2021, through January 2024, the last month for which Bureau of Labor Statistics data is available – though it’s worth noting that the growth largely occurred in 2021 and 2022 (with 746,000 manufacturing jobs added starting in February 2021) before a relatively flat 2023.From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Alicia WallaceJust as he’s done on the campaign trail, Biden touted his administration’s efforts to reduce the burden of prescription drug costs. In his address, he also pointed out the savings for taxpayers.“That’s not just saving seniors money, it’s saving taxpayers money,” Biden said, referring to the Inflation Reduction Act, which contained several measures to reduce drug prices. “We cut the federal deficit by $160 billion.”Facts First: It’s true that two of the main drug price provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats pushed through Congress in 2022, are expected to reduce the deficit by $160 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In total, the law’s drug measures are expected to reduce the deficit by $237 billion, though delaying the implementation of a Trump administration drug rebate rule accounts for the difference.The Inflation Reduction Act authorized Medicare to negotiate the prices of certain costly prescription drugs for the first time. This measure is expected to save $98.5 billion over a decade, according to the CBO. Negotiations for the initial 10 drugs are underway. The final prices will be made public by September and take effect in 2026.The law also requires drugmakers to pay a rebate to the federal government if they raise the prices of certain medications faster than the rate of inflation. This is expected to save $63.2 billion over a decade, according to the CBO.From CNN’s Tami LuhbyBiden said: “I have been delivering real results in fiscally responsible ways.”“We’ve already cut the federal deficit – we’ve already cut the federal deficit of over $1 trillion,” he said.Facts First: Biden’s claim leaves out such critical context that it is misleading. While the annual federal budget deficit was more than $1 trillion lower in the 2023 fiscal year than it was in both the 2020 fiscal year (under President Donald Trump) and the 2021 fiscal year (partially under Trump and partially under Biden), analysts have repeatedly noted that Biden’s own actions, including laws he has signed and executive orders he has issued, have had the overall effect of worsening annual deficits, not reducing them. As in past remarks, Biden didn’t explain that the primary reason the deficit fell by a record amount during his tenure was that it had skyrocketed to a record high at the end of Trump’s term because of bipartisan emergency pandemic relief spending, then fell as expected when that spending expired as planned.“The deficit is a trillion dollars lower, roughly, than when President Biden took office. That’s true. But that’s driven not because he ‘reduced’ the deficit by a trillion dollars, but because when he took office it was the middle of Covid and we had been temporarily injecting huge sums of money into the economy,” Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group that promotes deficit reduction and tracks the issue, said in a February interview.The deficit hit a record of about $3.1 trillion under Trump amid the hefty pandemic-related spending in fiscal 2020. The deficit then fell under Trump and Biden in fiscal 2021 (to about $2.8 trillion) and again under Biden in fiscal 2022 (to about $1.4 trillion). But it then rose in fiscal 2023 (to about $1.7 trillion). And the jump from 2022 to 2023 would have been much bigger, from about $1 trillion in 2022 to about $2 trillion in 2023, if not for a Treasury Department accounting decision related to the Biden student debt cancellation program the Supreme Court blocked before it came into effect.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that the deficit will decline slightly in fiscal 2024, to about $1.5 trillion. Regardless, all of the Biden-era deficits are among the biggest in US history.Factors out of a president’s control, like interest rates hikes, have played a role in keeping deficits high under Biden. And Biden has signed some deficit-fighting bills; his signature Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is expected to bring down deficits by a total of more than $230 billion over a decade, while the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 is expected to cut a cumulative $1.5 trillion from federal deficits over a decade.Still, Biden’s actions have clearly added to deficits. These actions include a pandemic relief law, a bipartisan infrastructure law, a bipartisan law to spur semiconductor manufacturing, a boost to food stamp benefits and an extension of the Trump-era pandemic pause on federal student loan repayments.Biden can fairly say that his policies have contributed to a strong economic recovery that has boosted tax revenues and thus eaten into deficits. On the whole, though, Goldwein said deficits under Biden have been “higher than they otherwise would have been because of legislation President Biden has signed into law and executive actions he’s taken.”From CNN’s Daniel DaleBiden claimed the economy created a record 15 million jobs in the first three years of his term.Facts First: Biden’s claim is correct: the US economy added about 14.8 million jobs between Biden’s first full month in office, February 2021, and January 2024, more jobs than were added in any previous four-year presidential term. However, it’s important to note that Biden took office in an unusual pandemic context that makes meaningful comparison to other periods very difficult.Biden became president less than a year after the US economy had shed nearly 22 million jobs over two months, March 2020 and April 2020, because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The jobs recovery then began immediately after that, under then-President Donald Trump, but there was still an unprecedented hole to fill when Biden took office.Nonetheless, Biden is free to argue that his stimulus legislation and other policies have helped the country gain jobs faster than it otherwise would have. The US has had an extraordinarily strong labor market under Biden, and its overall economic recovery from the pandemic has outpaced those of many other major countries.From CNN’s Daniel DaleBiden cited a 2021 report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy think tank that found that 55 of the country’s largest corporations had made $40 billion in profit in their previous fiscal year but not paid any federal corporate income taxes. He said, “Remember in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion and paid zero in federal income taxes. Zero. Not anymore. Thanks to the law I wrote and we signed, big companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.”Facts First: Biden’s “not anymore” claim is false, an exaggeration. While his 15% corporate minimum tax will reduce the number of big companies that don’t pay any federal taxes, it’s not true that “not anymore” will any big company – such as the ones on the list of 55 companies Biden mentioned – ever do so. That’s because the minimum tax, on the “book income” companies report to investors, only applies to companies with at least $1 billion in average annual income. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, only 14 of the companies on its list of 55 non-payers reported having US pre-tax income of at least $1 billion.In other words, there will clearly still be some large and profitable corporations paying no federal income tax despite the existence of the tax. The exact number is not known.Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told CNN in 2022 that the new tax is “an important step forward from the status quo” and that it would raise substantial revenue, but he also said: “I wouldn’t want to assert that the minimum tax will end the phenomenon of zero-tax profitable corporations. A more accurate phrasing would be to say that the minimum tax will *help* ensure that *the most profitable* corporations pay at least some federal income tax.”There are lots of nuances to the tax; you can read more specifics here. Asked for comment in early 2023, when Biden made a similar claim, a White House official told CNN: “The Inflation Reduction Act ensures the wealthiest corporations pay a 15% minimum tax, precisely the corporations the President focused on during the campaign and in office.”From CNN’s Daniel DaleBiden claimed during his State of the Union address Thursday night that violent crime has fallen to one of its lowest levels in “more than 50 years.”Facts First: This is true, at least based on preliminary 2023 data that should be treated with caution. The preliminary 2023 data published by the FBI, running through the third quarter of the year, showed that violent crime was down 8.2% compared to the same period in 2022 – a decline that would be “historically large” for a year, crime data expert Jeff Asher wrote in a December article. Asher wrote: “The quarterly data shows violent crime down in big cities, small cities, suburban counties, and rural counties, pretty much across the board.”Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, told CNN in late February that, if the decline in reported violent crime for the full year of 2023 ended up being greater than 1.6%, 2023 would have the lowest violent crime rate since 1970. The 2022 rate was the second-lowest since 1970, worse than only 2019.As always, whether crime is rising or falling, it’s important to note that it is notoriously difficult to pinpoint the reasons that crime has increased or decreased at any given time, since there is a long list of economic, social and political factors at play; the impact of the president is unclear.From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth BlackburnBiden, as he was discussing the state of the country four years earlier, said more than 1 million American lives were lost to Covid-19, implying it was under the Trump administrationFacts First: Biden’s figure needs context. Many lives were lost to Covid-19 during the Trump administration, but the US didn’t reach its millionth death until May 2022 when Biden was in office.While there were a significant number of lives lost to Covid during the Trump administration, on President Donald Trump’s last full day in office the US death count reached at least 400,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. At that point during the pandemic there had been a winter surge in cases and someone was dying from the virus in the US every 26 seconds, according to KFF, a health policy and research organization. The death rate from Covid-19 in the US at the time was lower than in many other countries, but with the country’s large population, the death numbers exceeded all other countries at that time.Officially the US surpassed a million deaths from Covid in May 2022 during the Biden administration. As of this February, more than 1.18 million people in the US have died from Covid-19 according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.From CNN’s Jen ChristensenTouting the economy during his presidency, Biden said, “Unemployment at 50-year lows.”Facts First: This needs context.The unemployment rate did hit a five-decade low during two months of early 2023, 3.4%, and it has since remained close to that level – but the latest available unemployment rate, 3.7% for January, is higher than the rate was during nine months under President Donald Trump in 2019 and pre-pandemic 2020. (The rate then skyrocketed on account of the pandemic, and it was 6.4% the month Biden took office in January 2021.)From CNN’s Daniel DaleBiden said, “A record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses, and each one is a little act of hope.”Facts First: Biden’s claim is accurate based on federal data, though there is an important nuance to note. More than 16.3 million business applications had been filed during the Biden presidency as of February 17, official federal data show, the most over any period of the same length since the data series began in the mid-2000s. It’s worth noting that not all business applications turn into actual businesses. However, so-called “high propensity” business applications, those thought to have a high likelihood of turning into a business with employees, have also set records under Biden.The spike in overall business applications began in the second half of 2020 under President Donald Trump and accelerated under Biden in 2021; the number of applications then remained high in 2022 and then narrowly set a new record in 2023. There are various reasons for the pandemic-era boom in entrepreneurship, which began after millions of Americans lost their jobs in early 2020. Among them: some newly unemployed workers seized the moment of disruption to start their own enterprises; Americans had extra money from stimulus bills signed by Trump and Biden; interest rates were particularly low until the series of rate hikes that began in the spring of 2022.From CNN’s Daniel DaleBiden once again touted the impact that the temporary enhancement to the child tax credit – a key provision in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act – had on reducing the poverty rate among children. He called on Congress to bring back the now-expired beefed up credit.“In fact, the child tax credit I passed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions of working families and cut child poverty in half,” he said.Facts First: Biden’s assertions are true, though the benefit only lasted for the one year the temporary enhancement was in effect. Child poverty increased in 2022 to a rate higher than in 2020.The American Rescue Plan Act, which Democrats pushed through Congress in March 2021, increased the size of the credit for certain families, enabled many more parents to claim it and distributed half of it on a monthly basis.That sent child poverty – as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure – to a record low 5.2% in 2021, a drop of 46% from 2020, when the rate was 9.7% according to the US Census Bureau. The Supplemental Poverty Measure, which began in 2009, takes into account certain non-cash government assistance, tax credits and needed expenses.But in 2022, child poverty soared to 12.4%, roughly comparable to where it was prior to the pandemic in 2019. It was the largest jump in child poverty since the Supplemental Poverty Measure began.The House recently passed a tax bill that would again expand the child tax credit temporarily, though the boost would not be as generous as it was in 2021. However, the legislation is now stuck in the Senate, and it’s unclear whether it has the votes to pass.From CNN’s Tami LuhbyIn his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden said that the gap between the amount of goods the US imports from China and the amount it exports to China was the narrowest in more than 10 years.“Our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade,” Biden said. “We’re standing up against China’s unfair economic practices.”Facts First: What Biden said is true but needs context. The US trade deficit with China in 2023 was $279 billion, the US Commerce Department reported earlier this year. That was the lowest it has been since 2010.But the reason for the narrowing trade gap isn’t because of any Biden administration policy. Inflation has driven American consumers away from discretionary purchases, such as electronics – stuff that is primarily made in China. Instead, they’re buying more non-discretionary items, such as groceries.On top of that, the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese goods, which Biden’s administration left in place, have made Chinese goods less popular for Americans, because of the added cost.That’s why, for the first time in two decades, the US imported more goods from a country other than China: Mexico exported more goods to the US than any other country last year.The US trade gap didn’t just narrow with China: It shrank dramatically with most countries. The total US trade deficit was $773.4 billion last year, a nearly 19% decline from 2022. That’s the largest annual decline in the trade deficit since 2009. Also contributing to the narrowing trade gap: a weaker dollar that made US goods cost less overseas.From CNN’s Dave GoldmanPresidnet Joe Biden claimed during his State of the Union address that the average federal tax rate for billionaires is 8.2%.Facts First: Biden used the 8.2% figure in a way that was misleading. As in previous speeches, Biden didn’t explain that the figure is based on an alternative calculation from economists in his own administration that factors in unrealized capital gains that are not treated as taxable income under federal law. In other words, while Biden made it sound like he was talking about a federal tax rate, he was actually citing a figure that is not based on the way the US tax system actually works at present.There’s nothing inherently wrong with the alternative calculation itself; the administration economists who came up with it explained it in detail on the White House website in 2021. Biden, however, has tended to cite it without any context about what it is and isn’t, leaving open the impression that he was talking about what these billionaire families pay under current law.So what do the wealthiest billionaire families pay under current law? It’s not publicly known, but experts say it’s clearly more than 8%.“Biden’s numbers are way too low,” Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, told CNN in 2023. Gleckman said that in 2019, University of California, Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman “estimated the top 400 households paid an average effective tax rate of about 23 percent in 2018. They got a lot of attention at the time because that rate was lower than the average rate of 24 percent for the bottom half of the income distribution. But it still was way more than 2 or 3,” numbers Biden has used in some previous speeches, “or even 8 percent.”In February 2024, Gleckman provided additional calculations from the Tax Policy Center. The center found that the top 0.1% of households paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 30.3% in 2020, including an average income tax rate of 24.3%.From CNN’s Daniel DaleDelivering the official Republican response to Biden’s State of the Union address, Britt said, “We have the worst inflation in 40 years.”Facts First: This claim is false. Britt could have accurately said, in past tense, that inflation was at a 40-year high when it hit its Biden-era peak of 9.1% in June 2022. But inflation has declined sharply since that June 2022 peak, and the most recent available rate, for January 2024, was 3.1%. The Biden presidency aside, that rate was exceeded as recently as 2011 – far less than 40 years ago.Like Britt, former President Donald Trump and other Republicans have repeatedly ignored the decline in inflation since June 2022 to criticize Biden in the present tense.From CNN’s Daniel DaleBritt said that just after taking office in 2021, Biden “suspended all deportations.”“President Biden inherited the most secure border of all time. But minutes after taking office, he suspended all deportations.”Facts First: This needs context. Hours after taking office, Biden did call for a 100-day pause on deportations, but not “all deportations.”The moratorium excluded individuals suspected of terrorism or espionage, among other groups. But, more importantly, the suspension never actually took effect. A federal judge in Texas immediately blocked the action and it was never revived.From CNN’s Danya Gainor"

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday indefinitely blocked Texas from enforcing an immigration law that would allow state officials to arrest and detain people they suspect of entering the country illegally.The so-called administrative stay will remain in place while the court considers emergency appeals from the Biden administration and others, who want the justices to block enforcement of the law while their legal challenges to it play out. Monday’s order does not include an expiration date for the stay.The order came from Justice Samuel Alito because he oversees matters arising from the appeals court that is currently weighing the case.Senate Bill 4, signed into law by Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in December, immediately raised concerns among immigration advocates of increased racial profiling as well as detentions and attempted deportations by state authorities in Texas, where Latinos represent 40% of the population.“The Supreme Court has temporarily halted enforcement of SB 4, but it didn’t halt Texas’ pre-existing authority to arrest for criminal trespass and other violations of the law,” Abbott said in a statement Monday, adding that “Texas will continue utilizing every tool and strategy to respond to this Biden-made border crisis.”The Justice Department has argued that the law would “profoundly” alter the status quo “that has existed between the United States and the States in the context of immigration for almost 150 years.”“People can disagree about immigration. They always have. And Texas may be deeply concerned about recent immigration,” attorneys for a pair of immigration groups and El Paso County wrote in court papers. “But the same was true of California in the 1870s, Pennsylvania and Michigan in the 1930s, and Arizona in 2012. Nevertheless, for 150 years this Court has made clear that states are not allowed to regulate the core immigration field of entry and removal.”A federal judge in Austin, Texas, had blocked the state government from implementing the law. But the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay of the lower court’s decision and said the law would take effect on March 10 if the Supreme Court didn’t act. The pair of appeals soon followed, and Alito issued the administrative stay on March 4.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, and other officials told the Supreme Court that the “Constitution recognizes that Texas has the sovereign right to defend itself from violent transnational cartels that flood the State with fentanyl, weapons, and all manner of brutality.”The state officials described Texas in court papers as being “the nation’s first-line defense against transnational violence” and said the state has been “forced to deal with the deadly consequences of the federal government’s inability or unwillingness to protect the border.”Oral arguments at the 5th Circuit are scheduled for next month.This story has been updated with additional details."

        "title": "Trump says any Jewish person who votes for Democrats ‘hates their religion’ and ‘everything about Israel’",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Former President Donald Trump said in an interview aired Monday that any Jewish person who votes for Democrats “hates their religion” and hates “everything about Israel,” again playing into an antisemitic trope that Jewish Americans have dual loyalties to the US and to Israel.Trump was asked on a podcast hosted by his former White House aide Sebastian Gorka about criticism from the Biden administration and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.“I actually think they hate Israel,” Trump said. “I don’t think they hate him, I think they hate Israel. And the Democrat Party hates Israel.”“Any Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion,” Trump said. “They hate everything about Israel, and they should be ashamed of themselves because Israel will be destroyed.”Trump directly slammed Schumer, who recently criticized Netanyahu’s government and called for new elections in a speech on the Senate floor about Israel’s war on Hamas and the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Schumer is the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in America.“Don’t forget, when you see those Palestinian marches, even I, I’m amazed at how many people are in those marches. And guys like Schumer see that, and to him it’s votes, I think it’s votes more than anything else, because he was always pro-Israel. He’s very anti-Israel now,” Trump said.Schumer, responding to Trump’s comments Monday, said in a post on X, “To make Israel a partisan issue only hurts Israel and the US-Israeli relationship. Trump is making highly partisan and hateful rants.”“I am working in a bipartisan way to ensure the US-Israeli relationship sustains for generations to come, buoyed by peace in the Middle East,” the New York Democrat added.President Joe Biden’s administration and presidential campaign both responded quickly to Trump’s comments Monday.“As Antisemitic crimes and acts of hate have increased across the world – among them the deadliest attack committed against the Jewish people since the Holocaust – leaders have an obligation to call hate what it is and bring Americans together against it,” Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for the White House, said in a statement. “There is no justification for spreading toxic, false stereotypes that threaten fellow citizens. None.”Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer also issued a response, saying in a statement that the “only person who should be ashamed here is Donald Trump. Donald Trump openly demeans Jewish Americans and reportedly thinks Adolf Hitler ‘did some good things’” — referring to comments the former president has reportedly made in private.And Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said in an X post, “Accusing Jews of hating their religion because they might vote for a particular party is defamatory & patently false. Serious leaders who care about the historic US-Israel alliance should focus on strengthening, rather than unraveling, bipartisan support for the State of Israel.”Trump has long played into antisemitic tropes, lashing out at Jewish Americans he says don’t support him enough. During his first campaign for president, Trump delivered a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition that was rife with antisemitic stereotypes, and shortly after he left office in 2021, he told reporters that Jewish Americans have turned their back on Israel.A year later, he said American Jews weren’t praising his administration’s policies toward Israel enough: “Evangelicals are far more appreciative of this than the people of the Jewish faith, especially those living in the U.S.” And last year, during celebrations of the Jewish New Year, Trump shared a social media post that said liberal Jews who did not support him “voted to destroy America & Israel.”At least 63% of American Jews said their place in American society is less secure than a year ago, according to a report released last month by the American Jewish Committee. The Anti-Defamation League tracked a total of 3,283 antisemitic incidents in the three months following Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel, CNN previously reported, a 361% increase compared to the same period the prior year.Jewish Americans have for decades been a largely Democratic and politically liberal constituency, identifying with Democrats over Republicans by a wide margin, according to the Pew Research Center’s 2020 survey. While Orthodox Jews lean heavily Republican, American Jews of other denominations, including the Reform and Conservative branches, have identified with or leaned toward the Democratic party.This story has been updated with additional details."

        "title": "Netanyahu’s response to Schumer widens rift in US-Israeli relations",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is refusing to bow to calls by the top US senator for a new election and is pushing back against White House warnings about a potential new offensive in Gaza, widening a rift with top Democrats in Washington.An extraordinary turn in US-Israel relations in recent days is coinciding with intense diplomacy aimed at securing a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas and the release of hostages as the conflict deepens bitter divides in US politics. But the gulf in trust and goals between Israel and Hamas has thwarted hopes for a breakthrough for weeks.Netanyahu’s defiance shone through an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday, three days after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer – the highest-ranking Jewish American in the US government – said that a new Israeli government was needed to reset war strategy and that Netanyahu was an obstacle to peace.“It’s inappropriate to go to a sister democracy and try to replace the elected leadership there. That’s something that Israel, the Israeli public does on its own, and we’re not a banana republic,” Netanyahu said on “State of the Union.”“The majority of Israelis support the policies of my government. It’s not a fringe government. It represents the policies supported by the majority of the people. If Sen. Schumer opposes these policies, he’s not opposing me. He’s opposing the people of Israel,” Netanyahu said.Despite the Israeli prime minister’s stand, there is increasing criticism of his approach in the US and overseas, at a time when his position among some Israeli voters is fragile, five months after terror attacks that besmirched his brand as the country’s ultimate security guarantor. Thousands of protesters filled the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem Saturday night, in two separate groups, one calling for the government to resign and others demanding the release of the hostages in Gaza.Despite a fearsome onslaught in Gaza, Hamas is far from defeated. Scores of Israeli hostages remain missing or unaccounted for. The huge death toll among Palestinians has hardened much of the outside world against Israel’s actions and squandered early sympathy after the October 7 terror attacks. And there is no clear plan for how to rebuild or administer Gaza – site of a humanitarian nightmare – after any eventual Hamas defeat.The heated rhetoric flying between Washington and Jerusalem raises fundamental questions about the future of the US-Israeli relationship. It also underscores the hyper-politicization of Israeli policy in Washington as Republicans line up to castigate Schumer and accuse Democratic leaders of snubbing an ally in wartime. The tensions are even more acute since some senior Democrats wonder whether Netanyahu is keen to keep the war going to postpone an election that could oust him. President Joe Biden’s support for Israel’s right to defend itself, meanwhile, threatens his own coalition ahead of his reelection bid in November, with progressive and younger voters upset over his handling of the war. Biden and Netanyahu therefore are being driven further apart by their own competing political imperatives.Latest developments also raise the question of whether Schumer’s stinging criticism augurs a shift to more pressure on Netanyahu from Biden. The president embraced Israel after the Hamas terror attacks that killed 1,200 people but has become more critical of Israeli policy in a war in which more than 31,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza health ministry. Amid shockwaves from Schumer’s remarks Thursday, Biden complimented the New York Democrat’s speech and said many Americans agreed with it. But he is yet to strike a similar tone.For all his evident frustration, the president has not taken tangible steps to apply US leverage against Netanyahu, who has repeatedly appeared to ignore US advice or calls for a ratcheting down of the war to spare civilians. Biden has moved to open new aid routes into Gaza with air drops and a temporary port link. But he has not conditioned the use of US-made and provided weapons to Israel. And the president, despite forging his own popularity in Israel with his initial reaction to the attacks and trip to the Jewish state in wartime, has not sought to appeal to Israelis over the head of Netanyahu. The Israeli leader has sometimes done as much in his own frequent interventions into US domestic politics.White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that Biden and Netanyahu don’t agree on everything in the war, before adding: “But that’s the government that is in place, and that’s the government, the war cabinet, that we’re going to continue to work with.”One of the glaring areas of disagreement is the proposed Israeli offensive in Rafah in southern Gaza, which Biden previously warned would cross a US “red line” – though his remarks were somewhat ambiguous. There is no doubt, however, that the White House is skeptical of the plan because of the potential toll on civilians in Gaza, where humanitarian conditions are worsening. Speaking on CNN, Netanyahu doubled down on his intention to invade Rafah, vowing to “destroy the remaining Hamas terrorist battalions.”But on ABC, Kirby said, “We would not support such an operation unless or until they’ve got a credible executable plan to take care of the 1.5 million refugees that have been pushed into Rafah.”As the reverberations continue from Schumer’s remarks on Thursday, there is renewed focus on diplomacy aimed at a temporary ceasefire in Gaza to allow the surging of humanitarian supplies to the devastated enclave and for the release of some of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas.Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told Al-Arabiya on Sunday that the group, which rules Gaza, had presented a “logical” proposal that could bring a breakthrough in the negotiations but accused Israel of wanting to prolong the war. Netanyahu told CNN on Sunday that Israel is seeking a deal that would see the release of 100 hostages in exchange for a six-week pause in fighting. But his criticism of Hamas underscored the fragility of hopes for a breakthrough. “Hamas’ outlandish demands … makes that deal a lot more difficult, but we’re going to keep on trying because we want those hostages back,” the Israeli leader told CNN.The increasing distrust between the Israeli government and top Democrats in Washington can be seen in their different opinions of how the war should be waged. But it also reflects long-term political shifts in both countries.Through his years in power, Netanyahu has moved sharply to the right, and his current coalition is the most conservative in Israeli history, relying on several small ultra-orthodox parties. In the United States, meanwhile, the Republican Party has undergone a similar transformation, and there is now considerable ideological synergy between the GOP and Netanyahu’s Likud.Netanyahu has also noticeably courted Republican leaders and irked Democratic ones. For instance, he lectured President Barack Obama in the Oval Office about the situation in the Middle East in front of journalists in 2011 in a way that infuriated White House staff. He traveled to Washington at the invitation of Republicans in 2015 to try to shatter an Iran nuclear deal during an address to Congress. He also aligned himself with ex-President Donald Trump – and got multiple policy wins as a result – including the relocation of the US Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.Given this background, and the feverish political climate in an election year in the United States, it’s not surprising Republicans are trying to seize on the rift between Democrats and Israel to their own electoral advantage – and Democrats see politics at play.Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said on “State of the Union” that the message from Netanyahu was: “‘Let us run our own country. We appreciate you as our close allies, but we’re going to make up our own minds, and we will do it according to our laws and our customs.’” House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul said on Fox, “There’s a way to talk about your differences – not to topple a democratic country.” The Texas Republican said there was a “split in the Democratic Party” between what he called a “pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel faction” and those who support Israel.Events of recent days are so remarkable since Biden and Schumer are among the most pro-Israel politicians in modern American history. But the deeply felt ties of both men toward Israel may, to some extent, reflect nostalgia for a more moderate political time in the Jewish state that is a far cry from Netanyahu’s radicalism. Even a year ago it would be impossible to believe that the Senate majority leader would call for a new election in Israel. His remarks last week speak to the extreme political pressure Democratic leaders have been under from other senior members of the party, not to mention their voters. Schumer’s remarks are beginning to look like a milestone in US-Israeli relations since it suggests that senior Democrats no longer believe that lock-step support for Israel involves acquiescing to every policy of a hard-right governing coalition.Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi – another longtime friend of Israel – offered staunch support to Schumer on Sunday and sought to explain the speech. “He loves Israel, as we do. We support Israel. And the fact that he made this statement should be listened to, because Israel’s reputation is at risk because of what is happening in Gaza,” the California Democrat said on “State of the Union,” alluding to looming famine in Gaza over which the World Health Organization expressed grave concern on Sunday.“Chuck Schumer’s speech was an act of courage, an act of love for Israel. And I wish the prime minister would read the whole speech, because he speaks with great vehemence about the need to defeat Hamas,” Pelosi said. “He is concerned about the weakness of the Palestinian Authority and the very, very dangerous attitude of the right-wing Israeli government.”"

        "title": "US welcomes new governments to fight against spyware as it finds more American personnel have been targeted",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The Biden administration is welcoming six new countries to a US-led pact to crack down on phone-hacking spyware as US officials tell CNN that the administration continues to find new cases of American government personnel being targeted by a technology that is deemed a national security and counterintelligence threat.“We are aggressively and intensively trying to identity and confirm more” cases of US government personnel whose phones have been targeted with commercially available spyware, a US National Security Council official told CNN.A year ago, the Biden administration put the tally of US government personnel either suspected of or confirmed to have been targeted by spyware at 50. It has since grown, the NSC official said, declining to quantify the growth in cases while saying that the counterintelligence and national security risks from the technology remain high.Spyware is malicious software that is used to break into mobile phones, turning them into a listening device and scooping up their contacts. The market for commercial spyware has exploded over the last decade as companies from Israel to North Macedonia have hawked their services and many governments have been willing buyers.A key prong of the US strategy to combat spyware has been trying to convince its allies not to do business with spyware companies whose tools might be used against US diplomats or to surveil dissidents and journalists on US soil.Poland and Ireland — two countries that have allegedly had a role in spyware abuse in the past — are among the new signatories of the anti-spyware pact, a move that US officials are touting as a sign of growing global momentum to curb what has been rampant abuse of the surveillance technology. Poland’s prime minister has claimed the previous government used spyware on a long list of victims. The US Treasury Department this month sanctioned an Ireland-based company for allegedly being involved in the spyware business.The other countries joining the pledge to combat spyware are Finland, Germany, Japan, and South Korea, according to the White House. The announcement will come this week in Seoul at the Summit for Democracy, an annual gathering of democratic governments around the world.Eleven countries, including the US and its “Five Eyes” allies, signed onto the pledge last year, which vows that “any commercial spyware use by our governments is consistent with respect for universal human rights, the rule of law, and civil rights and civil liberties.”Alarm bells went off among senior counterintelligence and national security officials more than two years ago when they began to discover that dozens of US government personnel were targeted by invasive commercial spyware. That included a dozen State Department employees serving in Africa, whose iPhones were hacked with spyware developed by Israeli firm NSO Group, CNN has reported.Governments using the spyware on US personnel may be trying to collect intelligence on the targeted phones or surveil people from their own countries that are meeting with US diplomats, the NSC official said. The official declined to name any governments involved.The risk is acute: Some spyware vendors either have “very close relationships” with a foreign government or are “under the clear control” of a foreign government, the NSC official said, declining to elaborate.At least 74 countries have contracted with private firms to obtain commercial spyware, the US intelligence agencies said this month in their annual threat assessment.A US government-wide study of the risk of spyware to US interests was launched, including a probe of whether US intelligence and law enforcement agencies were contracting with the very spyware firms whose tools other governments were using to surveil US diplomats.The Biden administration’s review “did not identify widespread use” in the federal government of commercial spyware, the official said in a rare interview on the subject. But US officials were alarmed by a “very aggressive effort” by spyware vendors to market their hacking tools to various US agencies, the official told CNN.The FBI, for example, confirmed in 2022 that the bureau bought a testing license for NSO Group’s Pegasus software. The FBI has not used Pegasus in investigations, according to the bureau.Alarmed by a lack of visibility into whether US government agencies were using commercial spyware, the White House last year issued an executive order barring agencies from using spyware that is deemed a national security threat or that is implicated in human rights abuses.“If you think that your use of some of these tools is going to stay quiet in your own system, think twice,” the NSC official said, paraphrasing US advice to its allies. “And we are an example of that,” the official added, referring to the fact that the FBI has bought a test license for Pegasus, and that the tool has reportedly been used by other governments on US diplomats.The Biden administration has sanctioned and restricted visas for spyware vendors and barred US companies from doing business with others. But it can only do so much on its own to dent a lucrative spyware market.Spyware companies often hide behind opaque corporate structures and companies to stay in business, according to US officials and researchers who track those companies. White House officials this month met with US venture capital firms to warn them about the risks of their investments inadvertently fueling the growth of spyware.“We are concerned about capital flowing in — and capital that folks may not realize is actually being used to fuel risks to Americans,” the NSC official said."

        "title": "Negotiators finalizing spending deal but still facing hurdles before Friday night shutdown deadline",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Negotiators are closing in on a spending deal to keep the rest of the government funded through the fiscal year, two sources familiar told CNN, but lawmakers still face hurdles to pass legislation and avert a shutdown for major agencies this weekend.Congressional negotiators reached an agreement Monday on funding for the Department of Homeland Security, according to a GOP leadership aide. At a time when security at the southern border has become a central issue in the 2024 campaign, funding for the agency had become a major obstacle.Aides caution that while there is a broad agreement on many of the elements of the bills as of Monday night, there is still work left to write the legislation. That process can be time consuming.The hope is for text to be released in the next few days.That means that lawmakers are still facing an enormous time crunch to pass the legislation ahead of the Friday night deadline. House Republicans are operating under a three day rule, which means lawmakers need several days to review the text before they can vote. There is also expected to be considerable blowback from Mike Johnson’s right flank that the speaker will have to navigate.Forty-three members of the House Freedom Caucus have already called on House Republicans to reject any deal without key border provisions.After months of averting shutdowns at the eleventh hour with stopgap bills, Congress finally passed a package of six bills in early March to fund a slate of government agencies for the rest of the fiscal year – but the work isn’t over yet.A number of key government operations still need to be funded by the end of the day on Friday, March 22, including the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State, and the legislative branch.The current fiscal year began more than five months ago on October 1, 2023. Since then, lawmakers have faced a series of fiscal cliffs as a result of funding deadlines created by short-term extensions.There are a number of challenges ahead.Under House GOP rules, leadership needs 72 hours for their members to review bill text. That means lawmakers could be working through the weekend to pass the bills after the Friday deadline has already lapsed. Then, it would need consent of all 100 senators to quickly schedule a vote – something that can be extremely difficult, especially over funding legislation.While government operations would halt if funding is not approved by the deadline, the damage would be minimal if a shutdown is only relegated to the weekend.Two sources familiar with talks say that negotiators were prepared to move ahead over the weekend with a one-year stopgap measure to fund DHS, but the White House got involved late to try and push for a full-year spending bill. That has slowed down the talks, the sources said.This DHS funding bill is always one of the most complicated to get across the finish line. Aides say work to fund other agencies including State, Education and Labor, HHS, Treasury and Defense are largely closed out.In the House, Johnson must navigate an extremely narrow majority and pushback from his right flank. Hardline conservatives have expressed anger over Johnson’s handling of the government spending fight – and the speaker needed to rely on both Republican and Democratic votes to pass the six-bill funding package earlier this month.That package, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden, included funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.Johnson was elected speaker last year after conservatives forced former Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his leadership post, raising questions over whether Johnson could face a similar threat to his speakership amid backlash from the far-right wing of his conference.McCarthy’s historic and unprecedented ouster plunged House Republicans into a weeks-long period of intense turmoil as they struggled to elect a successor, and many Republicans do not want to see that scenario play out a second time.This story and headline have been updated with additional developments."

        "title": "Will Biden and Trump debate? The brief history and uncertain future of presidential debates",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "To debate or not to debate is a complicated question for President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump as they barrel into an eight-month general election.Trump’s position: On social media, Trump promised he would debate Biden “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE.” He reiterated that commitment Sunday, telling Fox News that he would do it “anytime, anyplace” and would “even debate minutia.” It is a bold claim that is not backed up by Trump’s record.He failed to participate in any of the Republican National Committee-sponsored primary debates in this election cycle. He’s also the only modern, major-party nominee to back out of a general election debate, during the pandemic four years ago.The RNC voted in 2022 to end its relationship with the nonpartisan system that has sponsored general election debates since the 1988 presidential campaign. Trump has since cleaned house at the RNC. More on that later.Biden’s position: Biden only faced token primary opposition this year, and the Democratic National Committee didn’t sponsor any primary debates. But he has remained coy about whether he will debate Trump in the general election.“I don’t know if he’s serious,” Biden told CNN after the Gridiron Dinner on Saturday when asked whether he expects to debate the former president ahead of the 2024 election. “I don’t know if he’s serious.”Whether either man will show up to the debate stage is an open question, but there is a detailed plan for three presidential debates and a vice presidential one already in place from the Commission on Presidential Debates. It’s a nonpartisan organization that has leaders from both sides of the political aisle and gets funding from the communities that host debates and also “to a lesser extent, from corporate, foundation and private donors,” per its website.For more on the context and history of presidential debates, I talked on the phone with two experts:Here’s what to know about the US presidential debate system:SCHROEDER: The history in a nutshell is basically that there were four debates in 1960 between (John F.) Kennedy and (Richard) Nixon. Those were sponsored by the TV networks. And then there were no more until 1976.In ’76, the president was Gerald Ford. He had come into office because of Nixon’s resignation. So he was in kind of a weak position. He’s the one that actually challenged Jimmy Carter to debates, and that set in place this tradition that has existed ever since then of presidential debates.There was one year, 1980, where there was only one debate between (Ronald) Reagan and Carter, but normally there are two or three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate per cycle.The other thing that has changed is the sponsorship. Since 1988, the Commission on Presidential Debates has been the sponsor of the debates.(Note: Before the commission was formed, debates were organized either by TV networks or between campaigns.)While we don’t yet know the exact format or topics for the debates or who will moderate them, the commission announced the schedule last November:There are legitimate questions about whether debates should happen earlier, particularly when so many voters now tend to cast early ballots – something the commission addressed by scheduling the final debate of this cycle for nearly a month before Election Day.The commission selects these debate locations after accepting bids from locations, which are almost always college campuses.The commission sets criteria for candidates to meet, and Republicans and Democrats are usually the only candidates to qualify.In the commission era, the only non-major-party candidate to take part in debates was Ross Perot in 1992. Perot was not included when he ran again in 1996.For a candidate like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or a Libertarian, Green Party or No Labels candidate to meet the threshold, he or she would have to be constitutionally eligible to serve as president; appear on the ballot in enough states to mathematically win the election; and get at least 15% support in national polling from five different polling organizations selected by the commission.SCHROEDER: The beauty of debates is it’s the only time during these lengthy, two-year-long campaigns where you see the candidates next to each other and confronting each other.I think that’s a really important piece of any election, because it’s so different from everything else. It’s the one moment when the campaigns aren’t in complete control … which is why candidates don’t particularly like debates.SCHROEDER: Rather than change the outcome of the elections, debates tend to, as you said, confirm the existing perceptions that people have of candidates – especially in this day and age when, frankly, there aren’t that many undecided voters left.SCHROEDER: I think they motivate voters. Maybe you’ve already decided you prefer one candidate over the other. But does that mean you actually go out and vote?If you watch the debate and you’re fired up by a strong performance or scared by what the other candidate is saying, then the debate could conceivably lead you to vote.We have to remember that the ratings for debates are enormous. Typically, in years when debates occur, they’re the second-highest rated programs after the Super Bowl.Smart politicians can use the debate as a platform in front of tens and tens of millions of people to overcome negative perceptions that exist about them, or conversely, to reinforce the negative perceptions about their opponents.(Note: Around 73 million people watched the first debate between Trump and Biden in 2020, when it was broadcast on 16 channels. Many more probably watched online or encountered snippets. A record 84 million watched the first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016.)KALL: Going back to the first one, Nixon, he was in a car accident and he didn’t perform very well. People thought Kennedy looked better. Kennedy won.(Note: Nixon was hospitalized for weeks before the debate due to an infection that developed after he hit his knee against a car door.)Gerald Ford made a mistake about the Russian presence in Europe. (Ford lost to Carter in 1976.)Ronald Reagan won a landslide reelection. He had a really good zinger answering concerns about his age. (Reagan defeated Walter Mondale in 1984.)George H.W. Bush, looking at his watch, seeming out of touch, got dinged in 1992.Bill Clinton was great at connecting with the audience and with the questioners in the town hall format. (Ross Perot was also on the stage. Clinton won the three-person election.)People didn’t like Al Gore sighing and that hurt him. (Gore got more votes, but lost the election in 2000.)Barack Obama did terribly in his first debate against Mitt Romney. He was even down in some polls, and then had to really come back for debates two and three to try to win that election. (Obama won reelection in 2012, but it’s also worth recalling Biden’s strong vice presidential debate against Sarah Palin in 2008.)SCHROEDER: We watched him at the State of the Union address last week and not only did he get through it, and it was a long speech, but then he hung out for another hour afterwards. Just glad-handing with people in the chambers.But you’re right. It’s a very physically exacting thing to have to do, to be on your game for 90 minutes uninterrupted. General election debates don’t typically have commercials on like the primary debates, so you don’t even have a bathroom break.Debates are always risky. They’re risky even for people at the top of their game or people who are really good at debates, simply because unscripted politicians at that level are not used to operating in an ad-libbed environment.KALL: I think they both face risk, although at this time, I think Trump probably faces a little more risk, partly because of the expectations that he’s created.He’s been so eager about wanting to debate. If he doesn’t totally crush Biden on the debate stage, then it could look like a loss, and President Biden’s kind of benefited from low expectations his entire political career.SCHROEDER: In 2020, there were only two debates. There were three scheduled, but the second one, the middle one, got canceled because it was during Covid. And the commission decided to do it as a virtual debate instead of an in-person debate. And so Trump basically said I don’t want to do that.So there were only two that year. But of course Trump did do debates against Biden, as well as against Hillary Clinton in 2016.(Note: Trump was still recuperating from Covid-19 when the second debate was canceled in 2020. Four days before the second debate was canceled and 10 days before it was to have taken place, he returned to the White House from being treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The commission wanted to do the town-hall style debate virtually, in part because it was not clear if Trump was still contagious. Biden’s campaign refused to move that debate even closer to Election Day.)KALL: The big barrier, I thought, to having debates this cycle was Trump’s aversion to the Commission on Presidential Debates and the RNC’s aversion to them. But he seems to have kind of backtracked on that, or he just thinks that he wants to beat Biden so much that he’s willing to put that aside, because he thinks he benefits so much from debates and Biden would make a disqualifying gaffe.Trump has long argued the commission is biased, even though multiple Republicans are involved with it.The RNC withdrew from cooperating with the commission in 2022, although Trump has since cleaned house at the RNC, streamlining the organization with his campaign and installing a new chair and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as co-chair.It remains to be seen if Trump will indeed make use of the commission debates or propose some other platform, or if Biden will agree to debate Trump.Trump has a history of complaining about debate moderators who he frequently argues are biased. At one point in 2016, Trump suggested debates proceed without moderators. But a candidate would have to be completely confident of victory to forego general election debates altogether.SCHROEDER: It would be really hard for either candidate to walk away from an audience of 70 to 80 million people, which would be the largest opportunity that either of them would have to make their case before the public, so I remain optimistic.I really would hate to see us not have a cycle with debates, because then I think that it becomes harder to restart things in the future.This story has been updated with new reporting."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump already effectively sealed their party’s nominations on Super Tuesday. They’re both likely to reach the magic number of delegates in contests on March 12. But Americans across the country will continue to take part in the primary process until the final contests in June.Winning individual primaries and caucuses is just one step in the long path to winning a party’s presidential nomination. That process will continue to play out even though the outcome is assured. This story looks specifically at the Republican process, where there was more competition early in the race.Both parties hold conventions in the summer where delegates technically select the nominee. The process and rules are different for each party, but the primaries are about winning enough delegates to secure the nomination.There are different kinds of nominating contests and different kinds of delegates in a calendar that stretches from January to June, so keeping track of the delegate math can get complicated if there is a close race. That is not the case this year. Trump has won every state but Vermont so far and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his top rival, has suspended her campaign. Biden has won every state primary, but he did lose the Democratic caucus in American Samoa. His only remaining Democratic challenger, the author Marianne Williamson, took the unusual step of unsuspending her campaign earlier this year. She has not yet won any delegates.Performing well in primaries and caucuses equals delegates, and the larger goal is amassing the magic number of delegates to secure a nomination before delegate voting at the party convention.Winning the GOP nomination requires at least 1,215 out of 2,429 delegates awarded as part of the primary process.In years without an incumbent, like Republicans are experiencing in 2024, the winner frequently does not hit the magic number until May or even June. In 2016, in his first of three White House runs, Trump hit the magic number on May 26. Trump’s ability to hit the magic number in March is historic and evidence of his dominance of the Republican race this year.During most of the early primaries and caucuses, states award delegates proportionally. That means that each candidate gets a number of delegates roughly equivalent to the percentage of the vote he or she has won. Delegates can be awarded based on results either statewide or in individual congressional districts.For example, in 2016, Sen. Ted Cruz won the Iowa caucuses, but with less than 30% of the vote, he only got eight delegates. Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio both got seven delegates in Iowa that year.Sometimes, there’s a certain amount of support a candidate must register to qualify for delegates, and many of these states have special rules that allow a candidate who wins the lion’s share of the vote (often 50%) to take all of the state’s delegates.Things change after March 15. That’s when states have the option to award all of their delegates to whoever gets the most votes in the state’s contest.The introduction of winner-take-all rules makes it harder for any remaining candidates to accumulate delegates against the race leader.While you’re bound to hear a lot about Iowa and New Hampshire, contests that can be critical for giving candidates early momentum, those two states represent a small number of delegates.It’s not until Super Tuesday on March 5, seven weeks after the first Americans pick a candidate in Iowa, that a consequentially large number of Republican delegates is at stake. It was on Super Tuesday that Trump effectively won the nomination, forcing Haley from the race, although the process must continue to play out.Below, explore how many delegates are at stake in every contest.In addition to delegates who are bound to a candidate based on the results of the nominating contests, there is also a relatively small number of unbound delegates (142 total) from Pennsylvania, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and Guam. These delegates are not technically required to support the candidate who won their state at the outset of the convention and are free to support the candidate of their choice.The delegate math gets even more complicated if no candidate reaches the magic number during the nominating contests, although this hasn’t happened for decades. If there is no clear winner during the primaries, delegates could engage in rounds of voting at the convention to select the party’s presidential candidate.Short answer: it depends. Different states have different rules. In some states, if a candidate drops out and releases their delegates, they become free to support the candidate of their choice. In the case of the delegates Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy won in Iowa, under state party rules, those delegates will remain bound to their candidates until the convention, but if just one name is placed into nomination during the formal roll-call vote, the entire Iowa delegation votes for that candidate.While President Joe Biden has not faced much opposition in the Democratic primary, he still needs to win at least 1,968 of 3,934 pledged delegates awarded as part of the primary process. If he had been unable to get a majority, he’d need help from about 740 automatic delegates, made up of party leaders, elected officials and other Democratic bigwigs.To see live election results, visit our 2024 election guide."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The family of the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wants her name pulled off an award after the foundation in charge of doling it out named SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch among this year’s recipients.In a statement obtained by CNN, Ginsburg’s family said that, with the selection of this year’s honorees, the Opperman Foundation had “strayed far from the original mission of the award and from what Justice Ginsburg stood for.”Ginsburg’s family said they were not affiliated with the award and called the choices of honorees this year an “affront” to the justice’s memory.They added that the family supports a letter by Trevor Morrison, a former Ginsburg clerk. “(N)ot everyone on this year’s slate reflects the values to which the Justice dedicated her career, and for which the Justice is rightly revered around the world,” the letter states.Ginsburg, a longtime liberal member of the high court who died at age 87 in 2020, consistently delivered progressive votes on major social issues, including abortion rights, same-sex marriage and immigration.In addition to Musk and Murdoch, lifestyle icon Martha Stewart, actor Sylvester Stallone and financier Michael Milken are also recipients of the award.The Ginsburg award “celebrates leaders who have demonstrated extraordinary accomplishments in their chosen fields,” according to an announcement by the foundation on Wednesday.The award has “has previously recognized women of distinction,” the announcement read, but was expanded this year to include trailblazing men and women. The 2023 honoree was Barbra Streisand.“Justice Ginsburg fought not only for women but for everyone,” said Julie Opperman, chair of the foundation, in a statement accompanying the announcement this week. “Going forward, to embrace the fullness of Justice Ginsburg’s legacy, we honor both women and men who have changed the world by doing what they do best.”The Opperman Foundation did not respond to an inquiry Friday from CNN.The foundation described the honorees as ranging from “path-breaking innovators to seasoned veterans across a broad range of professions and industries.”In the announcement, the foundation said that Stewart was on Ginsburg’s “original wish list of potential honorees.” Regarding Musk, the group credited his “stratospheric accomplishments.”The group described Murdoch as “the most iconic living legend in media.”“This recognition not only reflects my journey in the media and publishing industry but also represents the relentless defense of civil liberties and a commitment to civil discourse that Justice Ginsburg embodied,” Murdoch said in a statement included in the foundation’s announcement.Neither the Ginsburg’s family’s statement nor Morrison’s letter singled out specific recipients that they objected to, but said the justice’s name should not be attached.“Each of this year’s awardees has achieved notable success in their careers, and each may well deserve accolades of one form or another,” wrote Morrison, who also served for a time as the dean of the New York University School of Law.“But the decision to bestow upon them the particular honor of the RBG Award is a striking betrayal of the Justice’s legacy,” he added."

        "text": "The way Americans buy and sell homes is about to get turned on its head.An earth-shattering, multibillion-dollar antitrust ruling against the National Association of Realtors late last year led to a settlement on Friday that will loosen the powerful trade group’s stranglehold on America’s housing market. The $418 million settlement with a group of homebuyers is expected to take effect sometime around July, pending a judge’s approval. It would transform a number of rules and guidelines set by the NAR that critics say have kept housing prices artificially inflated.The TL;DR: 6% commissions, split between the buyer’s and seller’s brokers, will no longer be the norm. Agent commissions are expected to fall — in some cases, dramatically — because they will be competitive and negotiable, and sellers will be able to shop around for better rates. And other broker tactics that critics say are anticompetitive, such as a rule that made sellers’ agents set compensation for buyers’ agents, will be prohibited.It’s not all good news: Buyers may have to pay their broker directly in the future, which could be tough for buyers accustomed to financing that commission as part of their mortgage. And some buyers could choose to forgo using a broker altogether. Also, a bunch of brokers are probably about to quit.But the biggest takeaway for homebuyers is undoubtedly welcome: The overall cost to buy a home should fall by thousands of dollars on average.For decades, Americans have paid a standard commission of around 6% when selling a home, split between the seller’s broker and the buyer’s broker. The National Association of Realtors and its 1.5 million agents say those fees are negotiable. But certain NAR rules have kept commissions significantly higher than in other countries, where they can average around 1% or 2%.After the settlement, those commissions will be fully competitive, meaning brokers can advertise their rates to prospective sellers, and people can shop around for bargains.Real estate commissions are expected to fall between 25% and 50% because of the new rules, according to TD Cowen Insights.Without the guidelines that buyers’ and sellers’ brokers split commissions evenly, homebuyers may have to change they way they pay their own agents.Typically, the 6% commission (typically 3% for the seller’s broker and 3% for their own agent) was passed on to the buyer in the overall cost of the home, which buyers can pay off over decades in their mortgages.But after the settlement is finalized, buyers may end up paying their agents in new ways; including, perhaps, a flat fee. A separate new rule will require buyers’ brokers to enter into written agreements with their buyers.Although that will add transparency to the homebuying process, it could become burdensome — particularly for first-time buyers, many of whom already have difficulty coming up with all the money they need for a down payment, closing costs, a lawyer and all the other fees associated with buying a home.One rule that particularly irritated NAR critics is going away: The requirement that sellers’ brokers advertise the commission they will pay brokers’ agents. The NAR now prohibits brokers from advertising that compensation.That rule had led to two bad outcomes for buyers, affordable housing advocates claim: The first is that it kept commissions artificially high. Second, it led buyers’ brokers to push more expensive homes on buyers, so their payout would be higher.The ultimate question: Will buying a home get cheaper? Industry experts almost universally expect the answer to be yes. As brokers grow competitive on rates, commissions could fall significantly.For the median-priced American home for sale — $387,000 — sellers are paying more than $23,000 in brokerage fees. Those costs are passed on to the buyer, boosting the price of homes in America. That fee could fall by around $6,000 to $12,000, according to analysis from TD Cowen Insights.In aggregate, that will save people a ton of money: Americans pay around $100 billion in commission fees each year, and homebuyers could stand to save between a quarter to half of that once the settlement is finalized, according to Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America, an umbrella group of nonprofit consumer organizations.The new reality could be tough on brokers, particularly people who don’t sell a lot of homes.US home purchases dropped to nearly a 30-year low in 2023 as supply has dried up, mortgage rates have surged and home prices continue to rise in most areas of the country. Although falling commissions could persuade some buyers and sellers to get back into the market, Norm Miller, professor emeritus of real estate at the University of San Diego, said the settlement could lead to a mass exodus of brokers from the industry.Potentially half of the 2 million or so agents in America could quit, Miller predicts, as the new rules become unworkable for many brokers.In a sign of how nervous this ruling has already made the industry, stocks of real estate companies like Zillow (Z), Compass (COMP) and Redfin (RDFN) were down 13%, 14% and 5%, respectively, Friday, and Zillow and Redfin fell further Monday.CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Elon Musk is showing the world how radicalized he has become.The billionaire, one of the most consequential figures to walk the Earth, spent another weekend swimming in the right-wing fever swamps of X — a bad habit that was apparent when his interview with Don Lemon was released Monday morning.In the contentious interview, Musk equated moderating dangerous and appalling hate speech to “censorship,” bashed the press for legitimate reporting, assailed DEI programs without supporting evidence, skewered advertisers who fled the X platform last year and yet again gave credence to the racist Great Replacement theory, among other things.To those not fluent in the intricacies of right-wing media, some of what Musk said may have sounded bizarre or even foreign. But in the right-wing fever swamps, where Musk is now deeply entrenched, these are the issues that animate the masses.Musk’s comments on the premiere episode of Lemon’s new online show added to an unhinged 72-hour posting spree on X, in which the erratic businessman raged against the “woke mind virus” and said its “goal” is “the destruction of America,” agreed with a user who wrote “Fake News is the Enemy of the People,” said the press is “basically the [Joe] Biden cheering squad,” accused the news media of “lying” about Donald Trump’s “blood bath” comments, called NPR a “nice version of Pravda,” alleged Google “manipulate[s] their search results with left wing bias,” said the January 6 insurrection was “not a ‘bloodbath’ by any definition,” and argued that if there is not a “red wave” in November, “America is doomed.”At this juncture, calling Musk a right-wing shitposter is no longer provocative. It’s simply accurate. And his ugly behavior is even more troubling because of the fact that Musk is enormously influential, casting a large shadow across multiple industries and doing billions of dollars’ worth of national security business with the US government.In his ownership of X alone, Musk controls one of the world’s most important communications platforms, spitting corrosive venom into the public discourse at a faster speed than his SpaceX rockets hurtle into orbit.In fact, as users of the platform once called Twitter know all too well, Musk’s posts often find themselves to the very top of the home feed. That is because, according to reporting from Zoë Schiffer and Casey Newton, engineers were forced to build “a system designed to ensure” his posts do well on the platform he owns.To make matters worse, Musk appears to be growing more intolerant of other viewpoints. While elevating right-wing extremists, he simultaneously seeks to destroy trust in credible news sources.Once upon a time, Musk welcomed having a media personality like Lemon on the X platform. Not so much anymore.On Monday, after his interview with Lemon was posted online, Musk trashed the former CNN anchor, calling him in various posts a “stupid asshole” and saying he is “just a bad guy, plain and simple.”“He’s not used to having to answer to anyone,” Lemon said in a Q&A with People’s Jason Sheeler, “especially someone like me who doesn’t share his worldview, who doesn’t look like him.”In effect, Musk has become self-radicalized on the very website that he was forced to purchase for $44 billion, sliding deeper into the darkest and most unsavory corners of the platform that has served to only reinforce his own worldview with an echo chamber of conspiracy theorists and ego-stoking sycophants that regularly fawn at his every move no matter how outrageous or preposterously false.All of it dished up by an algorithm designed to regurgitate it right back to him. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, Musk is hell bent on taking everyone else down there with him."

        "title": "Japan ends negative interest rate policy in historic pivot",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Japan has ended its negative interest rate policy, marking a historic shift away from an aggressive monetary easing program that was implemented years ago to fight chronic deflation.As part of the decision, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) raised its short-term interest rates to a tight range from “around zero to 0.1%,” up from minus 0.1%, according to a statement posted on its website on Tuesday.“Japan’s economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part,” it said in the statement.Recent data and anecdotal information have shown that the virtuous cycle between wages and prices has become “more solid,” it added.The BOJ has battled deflation since the late 1990s. Over the years, it has sought to encourage prices to rise by using a combination of conventional and unconventional monetary policies, including zero or negative interest rates and large-scale asset purchases.But as inflation rose and interest rates elsewhere went up, pressure has grown on the BOJ to wind down its negative interest rate policy (NIRP).Last week, major unions and companies, including Toyota (TM), announced better-than-expected wage hikes. Central bankers had been saying they wanted to see robust growth in wages before they can start to normalize interest rates.Though small, the landmark interest rate hike was the first in 17 years. Until Tuesday, the BOJ had been the last central bank in the world to employ negative interest rates.“The Bank of Japan has today ended an era of exceptional monetary policy accommodation,” Morgan Stanley analysts said Tuesday in a research note. “This can be characterized as a virtuous cycle of rising nominal GDP growth, wages, prices and corporate profits.”As part of its exit from NIRP, the BOJ also announced that it would abandon its yield curve control (YCC) policy, which was introduced in 2016 to keep the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds around 0% to maintain accommodative financial conditions.Meanwhile, it would end purchases of exchange-traded funds and Japanese real estate investment trusts (J-REITs).Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index has been seesawing between gains and losses. It reversed morning losses to trade higher after the news of the rate, and then slipped into negative territory again. By 2.50 p.m. Tokyo time, the index was up 0.3%.The broader Topix index was 0.7% higher.The Japanese economy will continue growing at a pace “above its potential growth rate,” as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies, the BOJ said in the statement.The inflation rate in the country is also likely to be above 2% through fiscal 2024, it said.However, it pledged to keep buying long-term government bonds at “broadly the same amount” as before, and indicated that financial conditions will remain accommodative “for the time being.”Accommodative is a term used to describe monetary policy that adjusts to adverse market conditions and usually involves keeping interest rates low to spur growth and employment.That suggests the BOJ will not embark on an aggressive tightening cycle of the sort that other major central banks, such as the United States, have engaged in in recent years to control inflation.“There are extremely high uncertainties surrounding Japan’s economic activity and prices,” the BOJ said, adding that the risks include developments in overseas economies, commodity prices and domestic firm’s wage-setting behavior.“Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan’s economic activity and prices,” it added.The Japanese yen weakened after the BOJ’s move. It slid 0.5% to 149.96 per US dollar by Tuesday afternoon.Analysts said the BOJ’s move might have been priced in by equities and currency markets.“Policy normalization was expected by [our] economists and consensus,” the Morgan Stanley analysts said.In future, analysts from Capital Economics say they don’t believe the BOJ will raise its policy rate any further.“We suspect that wage growth among smaller firms won’t be quite as strong as among those firms participating in the Shunto [wage negotiations],” they said in a research report on Tuesday.“With wage growth peaking this year, we still expect inflation to fall below the BOJs target by the end of the year so the bank won’t feel the need to lift its policy rate any further.”This story has been updated with additional information."

        "title": "The Chevrolet Corvette is officially going electric",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.Reuss didn’t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. “We will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,” he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only.While Reuss’s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it’s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model.“Electrified” is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as “electrified.” It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car.Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla’s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production.Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn’t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though.To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels.Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari’s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.In 2010, Ireland was in the middle of a Great Recession-induced meltdown that required an emergency rescue by the European Union and International Monetary Fund to the tune of about $70 billion, or 40% of Ireland’s total economy.Since then, the country’s low corporate tax rate has lured large multinational tech and pharmaceutical firms to its shores, and their payments to the government have bolstered revenue substantially.Ireland is forecast to have a $70 billion budget surplus by 2027. How’s that for a comeback?Now the Irish government wants to expand the country’s own businesses abroad, especially in the United States.Just last week Ireland’s ClonBio group, an agribusiness company, said that it plans to invest half a billion dollars to reopen a mothballed factory in Jefferson, Wisconsin, supporting 1,000 local jobs.Ireland is the ninth largest source of foreign direct investment in the US, with $295 billion spent in 2022. About 700 Irish firms employ more than 100,000 people in America.Much of that investment was aided by Enterprise Ireland, an Irish government agency that is also the most active national venture capital fund in Europe.Before the Bell spoke with Leo Clancy, the CEO of Enterprise Ireland, who was in New York to meet with business leaders and politicians last week before he left for Washington to meet with President Joe Biden on Saint Patrick’s Day.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Before the Bell: Why has Ireland been so successful at creating and exporting business enterprises?Leo Clancy: I think it’s because there’s a global awareness of business in Ireland. We’re a small island but we’ve been the beneficiary of huge amounts of foreign direct investment over the last number of decades. Most of that (was) from United States multinationals. And that’s actually given us confidence and a business culture that was global from the outset. Irish companies have to think about being in an Irish domestic market which is frankly, really small, or just going global straightaway.What do you think about growth going forward?Growth has been good for us. We’ve seen exports grow the last couple of years, and we see pretty positive tailwinds in most jurisdictions. The US is particularly strong for Irish companies; the US economy has held up well. You can see that in the job statistics. So notwithstanding inflation and the interest rate headwinds over the last two years, companies are still doing business.We see the euro zone and the US as our top growth destinations. The opportunity there is the green revolution in the US, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the chance to be part of that green story. I think Irish companies are very adept at pivoting into what other other countries need and being part of the story.It seems like Irish companies are increasingly becoming job creators in the US.I think it’s really important for the US audience to remember that. A lot of that has been through mergers and acquisition over the years and through organic growth as well. Glanbia Foods, an Irish company that manufactures American-style cheese, now produces one in four slices of cheese consumed in the US. That’s not imported from Ireland, it’s made from US dairy products processed in factories that they own in the US, and two thirds of their workforce is in the US as well.I buy Kerrygold butter, that’s an Irish brand.About 80% of the butter imported into the US is now Irish.That’s a surprising statistic – why do you think the connection is so strong in the US in particular?As we think about our US connections around Saint Patrick’s Day, we reflect on the diaspora that we’ve had and the number of people who have had to leave Ireland to find good work. When I started college in the early 1990s, I fully expected to emigrate. I got a job in what was an increasingly positive economy. And I think the same is true for lots of people. Entrepreneurship has grown over the last 30 years and people have learned from US business culture, in particular, because we have such a strong connection with the US.We have lots of people who emigrated to the US, picked up the US entrepreneurial spirit and brought it back. People that worked at multinationals and are used to scaling businesses. I think there is a stronger connection to US business culture in Ireland than almost anywhere else in the world.How do you prepare for geopolitical headwinds?We have offices around the world so we’re embedded in most jurisdictions, and we get early warnings of things that are changing. We’re always concerned about things that affect our clients, and sometimes we get deeply involved straightaway. So with Brexit in 2016, within six months we had trained most of our companies about what to expect with customs regulations, for instance. So Ireland had a very smooth transition through Brexit because the Irish companies were ready.As a small country we’re always hitting trade barriers. Understanding them early and using our diplomats as well as our own staff to anticipate what the consequences will be and then helping companies work with them is the important piece for us. It would be ridiculous for small countries like Ireland to think we can substantially change the trade regulations and the winds of change. But what we can control is what we do ourselves, how we react and respond. The most important thing we can do is promote the value of our business abroad. For Ireland to be a trusted trading partner, it can’t just send stuff to the US. It’s got to be invested in communities and add value to the US economy. It’s got to be aligned with US objectives. That’s true in the US and it’s true everywhere.The Federal Reserve meets in the US this week. How are you thinking about inflation and inflation on a global level?It’s been a very challenging 18 months. We’ve seen funding for companies get incredibly difficult, whether that’s venture capital or private equity. Companies are still raising funds, but it’s not easy. Going forward the consensus seems to be that rates will come down. Those reductions will be a good thing because our companies are taking on both debt and equity to grow their businesses. For instance, in tax software, one of our companies announced 150 new jobs into the US based on $70 million that they’re raising just to complete US expansion. We want to see more of that, and my worry is that if interest rates don’t come down some of those ambitions will be stymied.Elon Musk’s Tesla once represented the future of automaking. Now the company’s own future is in question.The once red-hot electric vehicle maker — heralded as part of the so-called Magnificent Seven behemoth tech stocks — is currently the worst performer in the S&P 500 this year, down more than 34% since January.The story of Tesla’s (TSLA) decline has been well documented. The company has been plagued by safety issues and recalls, slowing growth and has even been forced to slash prices. But a new report by Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan last Wednesday offers a darker picture than previously imagined.Tesla, he wrote, is a “growth company with no growth.”Langan predicts that Tesla’s growth will remain flat this year and then decline in 2025 as competition increases, deliveries disappoint and the beleaguered auto and tech company is forced to cut prices again.UBS also downgraded its forecast for Tesla last week. Analysts said concerns are mounting as demand for electric vehicles slows and as Chinese rivals take an ever greater share of the global market.The entire US housing market is about to get remodeled, reports my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald. The end product could come with a big perk: cheaper home prices.That’s due to a $418 million settlement the National Association of Realtors announced Friday with groups of homesellers.The settlement, which is still subject to a judge’s approval, will eliminate the long-standing standard 6% commission paid by the seller. Those fees, however, are often baked into the listed price of the home. Lower commissions could therefore lower home prices, experts say.And at a time when elevated housing costs are driving inflation across the country, reining in home prices could help bring price increases back to levels Americans experienced before the pandemic."

        "title": "It’s not you, it’s them: Engaged couples are cutting back on lavish weddings",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Multi-tiered cakes, elaborate floral displays and choreographed first dances: The traditional white wedding has been long considered a hallmark of American life.The obsession with lavish weddings grew to a fever pitch in the years following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, inflation soared — and the average cost of a wedding broke $30,000 for the first time in 2023, according to The Wedding Report, a research company that tracks wedding data.Now, after two years of elevated inflation eating into consumers’ wealth, for some engaged couples, splurging on a dessert table or extra sprays of flowers, which are the definition of “nice to haves,” has become a much less justifiable decision. That’s bad news for wedding vendors who provide services like videography, photo booths and catering.Meanwhile, those vendors are facing a more worrisome existential threat: a looming drop in the overall number of weddings.The number of US weddings soared to a 25-year high in 2022. Now, just two years after those highs, nearly 17% fewer weddings are expected, said Shane McMurray, CEO and founder of The Wedding Report. The halcyon days of insatiable wedding demand are unlikely to return anytime soon, he added.Forced postponements and cancellations in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid-19 were part of the reason for the recent surge in weddings. Demand was pent up: Instagram was stuffed with “wedding influencers,” and the TikTok hashtag #WeddingTok racked up billions of views.“I think it was the peak,” said McMurray.Gabrielle Stone, who has been a wedding planner in Boston for 18 years, enjoyed the recent boom.“2022 and 2023 were the most lucrative years of my business. I was turning people away,” Stone told CNN. But she said that so far in 2024, weddings are “cooling a bit.”Her theory: Single people who stayed inside in 2020 may not have gotten an opportunity to go on dates that year. In another life, some of those would-be couples who never met in 2020 could have gotten engaged this year.Signet Jewelers, which owns Kay Jewelers, Zales and Jared, had similar comments.“The jewelry category is experiencing its second Covid as engagements are down 25% due to the disruption of dating three and a half years ago,” Signet CEO Gina Drosos said on the company’s December earnings call. “I’m confident we’ll grow from this trough next year.”Generational trends may spell bad news for Signet and the rest of the wedding economy, however.The largest cohort of Millennials is aging, and the newer, smaller generations (Gen Z and Gen Alpha) place less importance on having a big wedding, said McMurray.“There’s no real growth in the wedding industry,” he said. “More people are cohabitating instead of getting married, so it’s a pretty flat market.”McMurray pointed to a recent joint study from the University of Virginia and Brigham Young University that found contemporary teens are less likely than previous generations to believe marriage leads to fuller, happier lives.“The trend has been going down for a long time,” McMurray said.Toni Burrowes, a 30-year-old teacher in Central Florida, decided to skip having a big wedding last month. Instead, she opted for a courthouse celebration with 18 close family members and friends.Burrowes said she had once dreamed of a destination wedding, but, after watching her older sister plan a large wedding, she didn’t think the stress ­— or cost — was worth the effort.“We make money to get by right now and we have a daughter,” she said. “All of those were factors in my mind with the wedding: ‘Do I want to spend all this money on one day, rather than continuing to save up for buying our house?’”She joins many people with sticker shock, according to McMurray, who said he sees more couples cutting wedding services they deem nonessential.“I’ve seen demand go down for things like invitations and decorations and those ancillary things that people would typically buy,” he said. “The more that those prices get raised, the more people are going to question, ‘Eh, do we really need that?’”Just as couples are adjusting to new economic realities, so too, are the small businesses that cater to weddings.Alyssa Young, owner of San Antonio-based bakery Cake Llama, started her business in 2019. She planned to focus on weddings, but she has been forced to diversify over the last year.“Wedding season was fizzling out. Out here, it’s become an oversaturated market,” Young said. “I’m seeing places close overnight. It’s just shocking.”She saved her business, she said, by experimenting: wholesaling baked goods to coffee shops and providing catering for touring bands in the area.She also got creative: She began baking egg-free, vegan recipes after the price of eggs exploded last year. In January 2023, the price of eggs was up by 70% year over year.Overall, consumer prices have somewhat steadied since then. But egg prices still rose 5.8% in February alone, according to the latest Consumer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.“Our vegan products are insanely delicious and super popular,” Young said. She created a new product category, “all because egg prices were so high.”Young has no plans to return to fully focusing on weddings. She faces growing competition from businesses offering lower-cost alternatives, including her local grocery store and even some people who turned their baking hobbies into full-time gigs during the pandemic.Overall, even as some couples have cut costs, they haven’t yet abandoned wedding traditions or vendors altogether.For example, though Burrowes cut many wedding extras from her courthouse celebration, she still decided to hire a makeup artist and photographer.“I tried,” she said, “to make it as special as I could.”This story has been updated to remove a photo."

        "title": "Retail sales rebounded in February amid higher gas prices",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Spending at US retailers rebounded last month as Americans shelled out more for gasoline.Retail sales at stores, online and in restaurants rose 0.6% in February from the prior month, up from January’s revised 1.1% decline, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. That was slightly below economists’ expectations. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation.January’s sharp decline was mostly attributed to the cold weather keeping consumers hunkered down at home. The broader US economy remains on strong footing, with employers continuing to hire and Americans still raking in strong wage gains. Retail spending has increased in seven of the past 10 months through February.Sales were up across most categories last month, rising the most at home improvement stores, by a solid 2.2%. In February, car sales climbed 1.8%, purchases of electronics and appliances increased 1.5% and sales at restaurants rose 0.4%.Gas station sales increased 0.9% in February from January.Meanwhile, furniture sales dropped last month, falling 1.1% from January. Sales at grocery stores, clothing retailers and online were also down in February.Spending is heavily influenced by the state of the labor market, which remains solid. American shoppers will likely continue to open their wallets as long as unemployment remains low and job growth continues to hum along.Still, economists are expecting higher interest rates and dwindling pandemic savings to take some steam out of spending. That didn’t happen last year, because higher interest rates tend to affect the real economy with a lag. Recession fears could also prompt US consumers to pull back, but attitudes toward the economy improved greatly in the final months of 2023 and a growing number of analysts don’t think there’s an economic downturn around the corner.“Consumers have the money, as inflation-adjusted incomes have been rising, so the question is, have consumers grown cautious?” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in a note Thursday. “It’s too soon to say, but with inflation stuck for now above 3% and the job market growing tighter, that’s a possibility.”“Still, the American consumer has been underestimated in the past and retail spending remains above the pre-pandemic trend, so no need to sound alarm bells yet,” he said.By now, most retailers have reported their latest earnings results and provided analysts with their outlook for the year.Target said last week that its sales fell last year for the first time since 2016, predicting a slow 2024 as consumers become fatigued by higher prices.Indeed, American shoppers are still being squeezed by inflation, which remains above the Federal Reserve’s ideal target of 2%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that low-income consumers and those living on a fixed income are typically hit the hardest whenever price increases start to pick up.Shares of Dollar Tree, which owns discount-store chain Family Dollar, tumbled on Wednesday after the company said it plans to close nearly 1,000 stores and that it expects earnings in 2024 to be below what analysts were forecasting. Company executives also noted signs of US consumers being under stress.“Persistent inflation and reduced government benefits continue to pressure the lower-income consumers that comprise a sizable portion of Family Dollar’s” customer base, Dollar Tree CEO Rick Dreiling said Wednesday on a call with analysts.McDonald’s said this week that cash-strapped, lower-income Americans are rejecting the fast food chain and opting to cook at home instead.“It’s a challenging consumer environment,” Ian Borden, McDonald’s chief financial officer, said at an investor conference on Wednesday, noting that many consumers are trying to manage inflation, higher interest rates and dwindling savings.Wall Street’s biggest concern at the moment is the possibility that inflation’s slowdown might have stalled. It’s too soon to say, according to analysts, but that would mean that the Fed keeps interest rates at a 23-year high for longer than expected.The Fed jacks up rates to slow demand and bring down inflation. Price increases are down substantially from the 40-year highs reached in the summer of 2022, but inflation’s descent has been rocky so far this year. That has dashed investors’ hopes that the central bank could begin to cut as soon as this month.If inflation doesn’t continue to slow, that means Americans’ borrowing costs will likely remain elevated for longer. A few economists think it’s possible that the Fed may not cut interest rates at all this year, but Powell recently said rate cuts do remain on the table.Fed officials convene next week to set monetary policy and they’re widely expected to hold rates steady for the fifth consecutive meeting."

        "text": "Starting Monday, YouTube creators will be required to label when realistic-looking videos were made using artificial intelligence, part of a broader effort by the company to be transparent about content that could otherwise confuse or mislead users.When a user uploads a video to the site, they will see a checklist asking if their content makes a real person say or do something they didn’t do, alters footage of a real place or event, or depicts a realistic-looking scene that didn’t actually occur.The disclosure is meant to help prevent users from being confused by synthetic content amid a proliferation of new, consumer-facing generative AI tools that make it quick and easy to create compelling text, images, video and audio that can often be hard to distinguish from the real thing. Online safety experts have raised alarms that the proliferation of AI-generated content could confuse and mislead users across the internet, especially ahead of elections in the United States and elsewhere in 2024.YouTube creators will be required to identify when their videos contain AI-generated or otherwise manipulated content that appears realistic — so that YouTube can attach a label for viewers — and could face consequences if they repeatedly fail to add the disclosure.The platform announced that the update would be coming in the fall, as part of a larger rollout of new AI policies.When a YouTube creator reports that their video contains AI-generated content, YouTube will add a label in the description noting that it contains “altered or synthetic content” and that the “sound or visuals were significantly edited or digitally generated.” For videos on “sensitive” topics such as politics, the label will be added more prominently on the video screen.Content created with YouTube’s own generative AI tools, which rolled out in September, will also be labeled clearly, the company said last year.YouTube will only require creators to label realistic AI-generated content that could confuse viewers into thinking it’s real.Creators won’t be required to disclose when the synthetic or AI-generated content is clearly unrealistic or “inconsequential,” such as AI-generated animations or lighting or color adjustments. The platform says it also won’t require creators “to disclose if generative AI was used for productivity, like generating scripts, content ideas, or automatic captions.”Creators who consistently fail to use the new label on synthetic content that should be disclosed may face penalties such as content removal or suspension from YouTube’s Partner Program, under which creators can monetize their content."

        "title": "Don Lemon says Elon Musk canceled his deal with X after ‘tense’ interview",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Don Lemon said Wednesday that his partnership with Elon Musk went down in flames, hours after the former CNN anchor conducted an interview last week with the erratic billionaire for the debut episode of his new independent web-based show.“Elon publicly encouraged me to join X with a new show, saying I would have his ‘full support,’” Lemon said in a statement, adding that he took Musk at his word that he was “interested in working directly with diverse voices.”In an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett on Wednesday night, Lemon spoke about his exchange with Musk and shared video excerpts from the 90 minute sit-down, in which Lemon asked Musk questions on an array of topics.Lemon said he pressed Musk about the rise in hate speech on X since the billionaire took over the social media platform last year, asking him if he believed that he and the company had a responsibility to moderate hateful content.“I don’t have to answer questions from reporters, Don,” Musk replied. “The only reason I’m doing this interview is because you’re on the X platform and you asked for it. Otherwise, I would not do this interview.”Lemon also asked Musk about a recent meeting he held with former President Donald Trump. CNN previously confirmed the meeting with Musk, one of several Trump held with donors in Palm Beach in recent weeks as he seeks to raise more money for his financially strained campaign.“I was at a breakfast at a friend’s place and Donald Trump came by. That’s it,” Musk said, adding that Trump did “most of the talking.”Musk said Trump, who is facing more than a half a billion dollars in civil judgments and multiple criminal cases playing out in the courts, did not ask him for money. Musk said he was “not paying his legal bills in any way shape or form.”Lemon also brought up Musk’s open use of the drug ketamine, asking the SpaceX founder if he believed it posed a problem for his government security clearance. Musk, Lemon said, answered no because he has a prescription for the drug.In his statement on social media, Lemon said the sit-down he conducted with Musk for the first episode of “The Don Lemon Show,” which will be released Monday on social media platforms including X and YouTube, was “respectful and wide ranging” and that “there were no restrictions on the interview that he willingly agreed to.”“His commitment to a global town square where all questions can be asked and all ideas can be shared seems not to include questions of him from people like me,” Lemon added.In a video posted on his social media Wednesday, Lemon took further aim at Musk’s claim to be a “free speech absolutist.”“Throughout our conversation I kept reiterating to him, although it was tense at times, I thought it was good for people to see our exchange,” Lemon said. “But apparently free speech absolutism doesn’t apply when it comes to questions about him from people like me.”While the interview is not yet public, a person familiar with the matter said Musk was miffed when Lemon questioned him on his use of the drug ketamine, his government security clearance, and the issue of antisemitism.In a statement, X defended Musk’s decision to pull the plug on its agreement with Lemon.“The Don Lemon Show is welcome to publish its content on X, without censorship, as we believe in providing a platform for creators to scale their work and connect with new communities,” the company said in a statement. “However, like any enterprise, we reserve the right to make decisions about our business partnerships, and after careful consideration, X decided not to enter into a commercial partnership with the show.”Asked by a user on X what led to the decision, Musk attacked Lemon and CNN, which is not involved in Lemon’s new venture.“His approach was basically just ‘CNN, but on social media’, which doesn’t work, as evidenced by the fact that CNN is dying,” Musk wrote. “And, instead of it being the real Don Lemon, it was really just [former CNN chief] Jeff Zucker talking through Don, so lacked authenticity.”But a spokesperson for Lemon told CNN that the media personality expects Musk to honor the financial terms of the agreement.“Don has a deal with X and expects to be paid for it,” the spokesperson said. “If we have to go to court we will.”Lemon technically had not inked a contract with X, people familiar with the matter told CNN. But contracts do not necessarily have to be signed to be legally binding, particularly if it is clear each side had arrived at a mutual understanding. And according to the people close to the matter, Lemon’s camp is confident that a deal had effectively been struck, as evidenced by the fact that X had touted the deal in public announcements earlier this year. Moreover, Musk himself appeared to acknowledge that there had been a deal, texting Jay Sures, the UTA power agent who represents Lemon, “contract is canceled,” according to people familiar with the matter.The deal’s implosion comes after Musk urged Lemon to launch a show on his platform, writing last year on X: “It’d be great to have [MSNBC host] Rachel Maddow, Don Lemon & others on the left put their shows on this platform. No exclusivity or legal docs required! You will receive our full support. The digital town square is for all.”In another post, Musk directly appealed to Lemon: “Have you considered doing your show on this platform? Maybe worth a try. Audience is much bigger.”Musk has claimed to believe in free speech absolutism, but he has repeatedly taken steps to limit the speech of critics. The billionaire has at times suspended journalists from his platform and filed lawsuits against watchdogs for publishing reports critical of X.While Musk frequently launches ugly attacks on journalists and traditional news organizations, he has simultaneously elevated conspiracy theories and extremist rhetoric.Last year, Musk endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory, which resulted in droves of advertisers fleeing X. Only then, days afterward, did Musk publicly express remorse for his actions.Lemon was ousted from CNN last year, in a decision that the longtime anchor said left him “stunned.” No specific reason was given by CNN for Lemon’s dismissal, but it came after he was widely criticized for making sexist comments about then-GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley. Lemon apologized for the remarks at the time, saying, “When I make a mistake, I own it. And I own this one as well.”This story has been updated with statements posted on X and additional context."

        "title": "Yet another inflation gauge came in hot for February",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Rising energy prices helped to fuel yet another hot inflation reading for February.A closely watched gauge of US wholesale inflation rose at its fastest pace in months, according to new data released Thursday. While a seasonal energy price surge is at the root of the gain, and less-volatile categories are showing signs of a continued cooldown, the latest Producer Price Index is yet another reminder of the arduous process to rein in inflation.The PPI, which measures the average change in prices that producers and manufacturers pay to suppliers, rose 1.6% for the 12 months ended in February, leaping from a 1% increase in January, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday. Economists had projected an annual gain of 1.1% for February.On a monthly basis, PPI rose 0.6%. That’s double economists’ expectations for prices to rise 0.3% for the month. Energy prices soared 4.4% from January and registered the highest monthly increase since August 2023.PPI captures average price shifts before they reach consumers and serves as a potential signal for the prices consumers ultimately end up paying.“The February PPI report was a mixed bag,” Gus Faucher, chief economist for PNC Financial Services, wrote in a note issued Thursday. “Inflationary pressures remain in the pipeline, but with supply and demand continuing to normalize after the pandemic, inflation continues to gradually slow.”And of all the major inflation gauges, PPI has shown the quickest return to pre-pandemic norms. In fact, despite the upswing to 1.6% in February, the current annual rate is still below the 1.7% average gain seen between 2011 and 2019, a review of BLS data shows.The hot PPI report comes two days after a similar trend was seen in the February Consumer Price Index, a closely watched gauge of inflation at the retail level. The headline CPI ticked higher to a 3.2% annual increase from 3.1% and rose from January at 0.4%, its fastest pace in months.A big driver: Gas prices, which have climbed to four-month highs because of a seasonal rise in demand and a switch to pricier fuel blends.Gas and food prices are some of the most visible to consumers, whose wallets are greatly impacted by the trajectory of those prices. Still, these prices also can vary widely and can quickly be influenced by unexpected factors, such as a refinery shutdown, a bad storm or a sweeping animal illness.As such, the Fed more closely looks at the behavior of price changes within “core” gauges that strip out the more volatile food and energy to provide a lens into underlying inflation.Core PPI rose 0.3% for the month, a slowdown from the 0.5% jump in January. On an annual basis, core wholesale inflation measured 2%, in line with the yearly increase seen in January. Economists were looking for the annual core reading to moderate to 1.9%.“For now, these increases in energy prices and food prices are not translating into the core number,” Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James, told CNN. “For now, it’s not that bad; but if this continues, and we have more shocks in terms of prices of petroleum, then the Fed will have to be very conscious of how that is affecting core.”Because energy and gas prices haven’t risen as much this month so far, Aleman said he expects improved readings for both the CPI and PPI in March. He also believes a Fed rate cut is still on the table for June.But, as it stands now, this week’s PPI and CPI reports keep the Fed on alert, said Kyle Anderson, clinical assistant professor of business economics at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business.“This is certainly a sign that we’ve got more work to do if we’re going to get inflation closer to the Fed’s target rate [of 2%, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index],” he told CNN in an interview. “This is definitely a signal that, on all ends, both core and otherwise, that we’re still facing challenges.”Energy prices accounted for 70% of final demand goods increase for the months, BLS said. But when taking energy and food out of that equation, core final demand goods still was up 0.3% from January, matching the highest monthly gains seen within the past year.Final demand services rose 0.3% from January, a slowdown from the 0.5% uptick the month before.“The trend has been that inflation has been falling on the goods production side, and that what inflation we’ve had has been driven by the service side,” he said. “This may change a little bit of that narrative.”"

        "title": "Japan ends negative interest rate policy in historic pivot",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Japan has ended its negative interest rate policy, marking a historic shift away from an aggressive monetary easing program that was implemented years ago to fight chronic deflation.As part of the decision, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) raised its short-term interest rates to a tight range from “around zero to 0.1%,” up from minus 0.1%, according to a statement posted on its website on Tuesday.“Japan’s economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part,” it said in the statement.Recent data and anecdotal information have shown that the virtuous cycle between wages and prices has become “more solid,” it added.The BOJ has battled deflation since the late 1990s. Over the years, it has sought to encourage prices to rise by using a combination of conventional and unconventional monetary policies, including zero or negative interest rates and large-scale asset purchases.But as inflation rose and interest rates elsewhere went up, pressure has grown on the BOJ to wind down its negative interest rate policy (NIRP).Last week, major unions and companies, including Toyota (TM), announced better-than-expected wage hikes. Central bankers had been saying they wanted to see robust growth in wages before they can start to normalize interest rates.Though small, the landmark interest rate hike was the first in 17 years. Until Tuesday, the BOJ had been the last central bank in the world to employ negative interest rates.“The Bank of Japan has today ended an era of exceptional monetary policy accommodation,” Morgan Stanley analysts said Tuesday in a research note. “This can be characterized as a virtuous cycle of rising nominal GDP growth, wages, prices and corporate profits.”As part of its exit from NIRP, the BOJ also announced that it would abandon its yield curve control (YCC) policy, which was introduced in 2016 to keep the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds around 0% to maintain accommodative financial conditions.Meanwhile, it would end purchases of exchange-traded funds and Japanese real estate investment trusts (J-REITs).Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index has been seesawing between gains and losses. It reversed morning losses to trade higher after the news of the rate, and then slipped into negative territory again. By 2.50 p.m. Tokyo time, the index was up 0.3%.The broader Topix index was 0.7% higher.The Japanese economy will continue growing at a pace “above its potential growth rate,” as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies, the BOJ said in the statement.The inflation rate in the country is also likely to be above 2% through fiscal 2024, it said.However, it pledged to keep buying long-term government bonds at “broadly the same amount” as before, and indicated that financial conditions will remain accommodative “for the time being.”Accommodative is a term used to describe monetary policy that adjusts to adverse market conditions and usually involves keeping interest rates low to spur growth and employment.That suggests the BOJ will not embark on an aggressive tightening cycle of the sort that other major central banks, such as the United States, have engaged in in recent years to control inflation.“There are extremely high uncertainties surrounding Japan’s economic activity and prices,” the BOJ said, adding that the risks include developments in overseas economies, commodity prices and domestic firm’s wage-setting behavior.“Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan’s economic activity and prices,” it added.The Japanese yen weakened after the BOJ’s move. It slid 0.5% to 149.96 per US dollar by Tuesday afternoon.Analysts said the BOJ’s move might have been priced in by equities and currency markets.“Policy normalization was expected by [our] economists and consensus,” the Morgan Stanley analysts said.In future, analysts from Capital Economics say they don’t believe the BOJ will raise its policy rate any further.“We suspect that wage growth among smaller firms won’t be quite as strong as among those firms participating in the Shunto [wage negotiations],” they said in a research report on Tuesday.“With wage growth peaking this year, we still expect inflation to fall below the BOJs target by the end of the year so the bank won’t feel the need to lift its policy rate any further.”This story has been updated with additional information."

        "text": "Beijing — Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng has announced plans to launch a cheaper brand, entering a highly competitive segment amid intense price competition in the industry.Models of the brand, to be launched within the next month, will be priced between 100,000 yuan and 150,000 yuan ($14,000 to $21,000), Xpeng Chairman and CEO He Xiaopeng told an industry event in Beijing on Saturday, the company posted on its official WeChat account.That compares with a 200,000 to 300,000-yuan range where premium electric-vehicle (EV) makers generally price their cars.Competition in China’s EV market has intensified as companies race to cut prices, with market leader BYD spearheading a deeper round of price reductions.Xpeng said it will successively introduce models under the brand, which it did not name, each with different levels of intelligent driving capabilities. The new brand is dedicated to creating “the first AI-assisted driving car for young people,” it said.Sales of battery-powered EVs in China slowed to 18.2% in the first two months of the year from 20.8% for all of 2023, according to the China Passenger Car Association."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Sports Illustrated isn’t shutting down, after all.The iconic sports magazine is set to get new life under a publishing deal announced Monday by Authentic Brands Group, which owns the magazine’s intellectual property rights.The news, first reported by The New York Times, caps a tumultuous several months for Sports Illustrated that resulted in widespread layoffs, an artificial intelligence scandal and the departure of senior executives.In January, The Arena Group, which had published Sports Illustrated since 2019, stopped paying Authentic its licensing fee for publishing rights. In return, Authentic pulled Arena’s license to publish the magazine, prompting turmoil at the outlet. At the time, Arena informed staffers that it would lay off most of its employees, throwing the future of Sports Illustrated into jeopardy.But after searching for a new publisher, Authentic has found one in Minute Media, a sports-focused content company that is home to several other notable brands, such as The Players’ Tribune and FanSided.Minute Media said that while it will continue the print edition of the magazine, it hopes to also usher Sports Illustrated into a lucrative digital future. Asaf Peled, founder and chief executive of Minute Media, said in a statement the focus will be taking its legacy “into new, emerging channels enhancing visibility, commercial viability and sustainable impact, all while ensuring that the SI team is inspired to flourish in this new era of media.”“Sports Illustrated is the gold standard for sports journalism and has been for nearly 70 years across both print and digital media,” Peled said. “The weight and power of that distinction cannot be understated.”Minute Media will work to retain most of the Sports Illustrated staff, a person familiar with the matter said. Peled told the Times it also plans to rehire some of the staffers previously laid off by Arena and expand the magazine’s publishing operations worldwide.The union representing the publication’s editorial staff welcomed the agreement to resuscitate the outlet.“We have said from the start that our top priorities are to keep Sports Illustrated alive, uphold the legacy of the institution and protect our union jobs. We look forward to discussing a future with Minute Media that does that,” Emma Baccellieri, staff writer for SI and vice chair for the SI Union, said in a statement."

        "title": "What happened when the world’s most populous nation turned off TikTok",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "As TikTok fans in the United States worry about losing access to the wildly-popular social media app, there are lessons they can learn from a country on the other side of the world.On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban. While the Chinese-owned app is not disappearing from Americans’ phones anytime soon, many of its 170 million users in the country are deeply rattled.But here is what they need to know: It is possible to survive and thrive in a TikTok-less world. Just ask the planet’s most populous nation.In June 2020, after a violent clash on the India-China border that left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead, the government in New Delhi suddenly banned TikTok and several other well-known Chinese apps.“It’s important to remember that when India banned TikTok and multiple Chinese apps, the US was the first to praise the decision,” said Nikhil Pahwa, the Delhi-based founder of tech website MediaNama. “[Former] US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had welcomed the ban, saying it ‘will boost India’s sovereignty.’”While India’s abrupt decision shocked the country’s 200 million TikTok users, in the four years since, many have found other suitable alternatives.“The ban on Tiktok led to the creation of a multibillion dollar opportunity … A 200 million user base needed somewhere to go,” said Pahwa, adding that it was ultimately American tech companies that seized the moment with their new offerings.The ban was not without pain. Indian TikTokkers had to grapple with confusion and even anguish in the days and months that followed.By 2020, TikTok had become hugely popular among Indians looking for relief from the pressures of strict Covid-related lockdowns.“Everyone in India wants to be a Bollywood star, and TikTok made that dream possible by making people, including those in small towns, overnight stars,” said Saptarshi Ray, head of product at Viralo, a Bengaluru-based influencer marketing platform.But it didn’t take long before other avenues for their creativity and commercial ventures sprang up.A ferocious fight ensued between US tech giants and domestic startups to fill the gap. Within a week of the ban, Meta-owned Instagram cashed in by launching its TikTok copycat, Instagram Reels, in India. Google introduced its own short video offering, YouTube Shorts.Homegrown alternatives such as MX Taka Tak and Moj also began seeing a rise in popularity and an infux in funding.Those local startups soon fizzled out, however, unable to match the reach and financial firepower of the American firms, which are flourishing.Citing independent findings from consulting firm Oxford Economics, a Google spokesperson said that “the YouTube creative ecosystem” contributed roughly $2 billion to the Indian economy in 2022.According to Ray, Indian content creators swiftly moved all the old content they had shot for TikTok to Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. “Some Influencers were uploading seven Reels a day and gaining four to five million subscribers a year,” he said.But not everyone was able to build a significant following on these platforms.“Many users and creators slipped into a deep, dark space after the ban, and some have still not emerged from that space,” said Clyde Fernandes, executive director— artist management at Opraahfx, an influencer marketing and management firm.“The way one was gaining reach and followers on TikTok is [still] incomparable to any other platform out there at the moment,” he added.US officials and lawmakers have long voiced concerns that the Chinese government could compel TikTok’s parent ByteDance to hand over data collected from American users.Cybersecurity experts say that the national security concerns surrounding TikTok remain largely hypothetical. Indian experts, however, say its purge from national digital life hasn’t resulted in a safer space.“I am not so sure removal of TikTok makes a dent in the cybersecurity threat landscape. Unless there is a step change in user awareness about the software on their phones, or what they download from the open internet, this is unlikely to change,” said Vivan Sharan, partner at Delhi-based tech policy consulting firm Koan Advisory Group.US lawmakers also fear that the app could serve as a tool for Beijing to spread propaganda, misinformation or influence Americans. The removal of TikTok hasn’t insulated Indians from those threats.“In terms of content and disinformation environment, it is plain to see we still have to grapple with serious issues like deepfakes, etc, with or without TikTok,” Sharan said. “So overall, it is hard to see which part of the risk-landscape changes significantly, assuming TikTok was certifiably problematic.”"

        "title": "Opinion: The drama around Sam Altman is an urgent warning",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the ouster of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to resign. Altman has already moved on to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its third CEO in as many days.It’s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company’s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions – governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies – reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators?OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence “to benefit humanity as a whole.” But that sensibility hasn’t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it – but they also won’t tell reporters or the public exactly what it is.This dynamic – a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors – is partly to blame for Altman’s firing. The OpenAI board, according to CNN’s David Goldman, worried that “the company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.” At particular issue seemed to be Altman’s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried.But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company’s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he’ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy – without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives.AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to suggest the design to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers acutely understand just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper’s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and “gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force” in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans, according to reporting in the New Yorker.But don’t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, “no gas mask is helping anyone.” (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI’s risks – at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils – the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology is worth a read).AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of “it may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier” but in the sense of “it could break down human societies and kill us all.”Given the life-altering potential of AI – that even if it doesn’t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed – we all have a stake in how it’s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be largely men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve – and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit.Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs?One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential – except likely more difficult to regulate and control.“Regulation” does not begin to scratch the surface of what’s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step.So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity – our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety.The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Italy’s competition authority has fined TikTok €10 million ($11 million) for failing to control the spread of content that it said threatened the safety of minors and other vulnerable people.The antitrust agency, AGCM, said Thursday that TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, had failed to take into account the specific vulnerabilities of adolescents using its platform, such as a tendency toward copying group behaviors.The watchdog announced an investigation into TikTok’s content moderation practices last March.In a statement Thursday, it said the video-sharing platform “has not taken adequate measures to avoid the spread of (harmful) content,” adding that its algorithms meant such content could be “systematically re-proposed to users.”An example of harmful content mentioned by the AGCM is what is known as the “French scar” trend, which involved TikTok users pinching their own cheeks to leave a lasting bruise.A TikTok spokesperson told CNN that it disagreed with the AGCM’s decision. “The so-called ‘French scar’ content averaged just 100 daily searches in Italy prior to the AGCM’s announcement last year, and we long ago restricted visibility of this content to (under-18s).”TikTok has been in the crosshairs of European regulators for some time, and has already faced fines totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.The Irish Data Protection Commission, which oversees TikTok’s activities across the European Union, ordered the platform in September to pay a €345 million ($376 million) fine, arguing that it failed to protect children. The regulator found that newly created profiles of children were set to public by default, meaning anybody on the internet could view them.Last month, the EU launched a formal investigation into the platform to determine whether it is doing enough to protect minors, saying that TikTok’s age verification tools — aimed at preventing children from accessing inappropriate content — “may not be reasonable, proportionate and effective.”This week has also been difficult for TikTok. On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill that could ban the platform in the country.The legislation would shut out TikTok from US app stores unless the platform — used by roughly 170 million Americans — is spun off from ByteDance and sold to a US company.Lawmakers supportive of the bill have argued that TikTok poses a national security threat because the Chinese government could compel ByteDance to hand over data on TikTok users in the United States.Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, described the potential ban as an “act of bullying.”Another Chinese-owned platform is also under scrutiny in Europe. On Thursday, the EU’s executive arm said it had opened a formal probe into AliExpress.The European Commission will investigate whether the online marketplace, owned by Alibaba (BABA), has broken a string of its rules, including those related to the spread of illegal content, minors’ access to pornographic material and the sale of fake food and medications.Angelica Chiara Yazbeck contributed reporting."

        "text": "Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg.Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17.That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm’s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company.Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman’s firing, is also joining Microsoft.Altman’s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive.Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the “Magnificent Seven” that have powered the lion’s share of the market’s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street’s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, reiterated his $425 price target for Microsoft’s stock following Altman’s and Brockman’s hires.“We view Microsoft now even in a stronger position from an AI perspective with Altman and Brockman” at the company, Ives wrote in a note on Monday.Other members of the “Magnificent Seven” saw a boost on Monday. Nvidia shares gained 2.3% to end the trading session at $504.20 ahead of its earnings due on Tuesday, notching a record-high close for the chipmaker."

        "title": "CNBC invited Trump on its air. The network didn’t even try to stop his lies",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.Suffice to say, this was no perfect call.CNBC on Monday made the curious decision to welcome Donald Trump onto its airwaves for an extended live telephone chat, in which the business news network allowed the twice-impeached, four-time indicted, insurrection-inciting former president a safe harbor to make a number of outrageous and false comments without scrutiny.“I believe on the ‘Squawk’ news line, we are joined by former President Donald J. Trump, DJT 45. It is good to welcome you. It’s been a while, Mr. President,” Joe Kernen, co-host of “Squawk Box,” greeted Trump on the air.Almost immediately after commencing the interview, Trump launched into one of his trademark, fact-free rants. Kernen asked the Republican candidate to outline his “vision for the country” following President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address, to which Trump unleashed a stream of deceit-laced drivel. Most notably, he alleged Biden has weaponized the government and that the US legal system under the “very angry and confused man” is now comparable to that of “third-world countries.”Kernen let it all fly. Rather than fact-checking Trump, or at least providing context about the serious allegations he leveled to viewers, the CNBC host brushed the insidious comments aside and attempted to move the interview along. Kernen, trying to conduct a serious interview with a very unserious man, proceeded to asked Trump about his view toward entitlements.But Trump didn’t answer. Instead, he said he disagreed with the premise of the question (that “something has to be done” to rein in entitlement programs) and pivoted to other topics, infusing his rambling response with more lies. The former president, for example, claimed that when he was in office, the country was producing oil at a “much higher level oil” than now.“We were drill, baby, drill,” Trump boasted.But, as those paying attention to the issue know well, Trump’s claim was false. US gas and crude oil production has soared to a record under Biden, surpassing Trump’s term in office. In fact, coincidentally, the US Energy Information Administration put out a press release on Monday noting that in 2023, the US broke all previous records for oil production. Unfortunately, Kernen failed to challenge Trump on the matter.Instead, throughout the interview, the “Squawk” host effectively surrendered the channel’s air to Trump, allowing the dishonest GOP candidate to abuse the platform and mislead its audience of influential viewers — all by phone.To be fair to the “Squawk” crew, it was not only Kernen who had the opportunity to ask Trump questions during the Trump chat. Co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin attempted at times to press Trump on various issues, such as his reversal on whether the US should ban TikTok. While Kernen showed no interest in holding Trump accountable, Sorkin at least tried to compel Trump to include some substance in his responses, though it was largely to no avail.Watching the CNBC interview felt like being transported in time to 2015, back when news outlets allowed Trump to phone in to news shows and deliver a drive-by of lies to their audiences. Even after the interview aired, CNBC waited hours to do the bare minimum and publish digital stories fact-checking some of Trump’s claims. Instead, the outlet quickly spliced Trump’s comments into a handful of clips and posted them online, amplifying his comments further.It is hard to see how any responsible news executive would defend CNBC’s actions as beneficial, nevermind smart. Asked why the network allowed Trump to repeatedly lie on its air without scrutiny, a CNBC spokesperson told me: “We asked former President Trump questions that are important to our audience such as social security and entitlement spending, and challenged him throughout the discussion on business issues like tariffs and their impact on the nation’s relationship with China. Additionally, the CNBC digital team has followed up with reporting throughout the day pointing out areas of inaccuracies and including comments from others questioning his statements.”Regardless of how debatable that characterization is, it is remarkable that after nearly a decade of covering Trump as a politician, prominent news outlets, having witnessed the democracy-threatening effects of Trump’s lies, have reverted to lowering their guardrails, allowing him to once again poison the public discourse with false claims. It’s even more striking given the stakes.Trump has publicly confessed he would like to rule as a strongman and exact revenge on his political opponents, should he win in November. He has even explicitly threatened NBCU News Group parent Comcast over the media giant’s political coverage, calling its chairman Brian Roberts in November a “slime ball” and declaring “our so-called ‘government’ should come down hard on them.” (Trump was notably never asked about these overt threats during his Monday interview on CNBC.)Instead of recognizing the threat Trump poses and assuming a more cautious stance, NBC News Group appears to be moving in the opposite direction. MSNBC has recently started taking Trump’s public remarks live (to the vocal objection of star host Rachel Maddow) and CNBC is now welcoming Trump to its air for friendly chats.At the end of Monday’s “Squawk” interview, Trump claimed his legal problems “aren’t legal issues” but “Biden issues;” falsely claimed Biden installed Fani Willis as the Fulton County district attorney; alleged without evidence Biden has “weaponized government” to target him; raged against E. Jean Carroll and again called her accusation of sexual assault “false,” prompting her attorney to suggest maybe she will sue him again; and ominously warned about the “fragile” state of the country and how “people are rejecting” the government for supposedly targeting him.Kernen, a purported newsman, apparently didn’t find any of those issues worth confronting Trump on. Instead, he thanked Trump for appearing on the program and immediately moved to invite him on again for more interviews.“We appreciate all the time you’ve given us this morning, Mr. President,” Kernen said. “I look forward to another conversation in the not-too-distant future.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Elon Musk is showing the world how radicalized he has become.The billionaire, one of the most consequential figures to walk the Earth, spent another weekend swimming in the right-wing fever swamps of X — a bad habit that was apparent when his interview with Don Lemon was released Monday morning.In the contentious interview, Musk equated moderating dangerous and appalling hate speech to “censorship,” bashed the press for legitimate reporting, assailed DEI programs without supporting evidence, skewered advertisers who fled the X platform last year and yet again gave credence to the racist Great Replacement theory, among other things.To those not fluent in the intricacies of right-wing media, some of what Musk said may have sounded bizarre or even foreign. But in the right-wing fever swamps, where Musk is now deeply entrenched, these are the issues that animate the masses.Musk’s comments on the premiere episode of Lemon’s new online show added to an unhinged 72-hour posting spree on X, in which the erratic businessman raged against the “woke mind virus” and said its “goal” is “the destruction of America,” agreed with a user who wrote “Fake News is the Enemy of the People,” said the press is “basically the [Joe] Biden cheering squad,” accused the news media of “lying” about Donald Trump’s “blood bath” comments, called NPR a “nice version of Pravda,” alleged Google “manipulate[s] their search results with left wing bias,” said the January 6 insurrection was “not a ‘bloodbath’ by any definition,” and argued that if there is not a “red wave” in November, “America is doomed.”At this juncture, calling Musk a right-wing shitposter is no longer provocative. It’s simply accurate. And his ugly behavior is even more troubling because of the fact that Musk is enormously influential, casting a large shadow across multiple industries and doing billions of dollars’ worth of national security business with the US government.In his ownership of X alone, Musk controls one of the world’s most important communications platforms, spitting corrosive venom into the public discourse at a faster speed than his SpaceX rockets hurtle into orbit.In fact, as users of the platform once called Twitter know all too well, Musk’s posts often find themselves to the very top of the home feed. That is because, according to reporting from Zoë Schiffer and Casey Newton, engineers were forced to build “a system designed to ensure” his posts do well on the platform he owns.To make matters worse, Musk appears to be growing more intolerant of other viewpoints. While elevating right-wing extremists, he simultaneously seeks to destroy trust in credible news sources.Once upon a time, Musk welcomed having a media personality like Lemon on the X platform. Not so much anymore.On Monday, after his interview with Lemon was posted online, Musk trashed the former CNN anchor, calling him in various posts a “stupid asshole” and saying he is “just a bad guy, plain and simple.”“He’s not used to having to answer to anyone,” Lemon said in a Q&A with People’s Jason Sheeler, “especially someone like me who doesn’t share his worldview, who doesn’t look like him.”In effect, Musk has become self-radicalized on the very website that he was forced to purchase for $44 billion, sliding deeper into the darkest and most unsavory corners of the platform that has served to only reinforce his own worldview with an echo chamber of conspiracy theorists and ego-stoking sycophants that regularly fawn at his every move no matter how outrageous or preposterously false.All of it dished up by an algorithm designed to regurgitate it right back to him. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, Musk is hell bent on taking everyone else down there with him."

        "title": "Top news outlets acknowledge Hur’s characterization of Biden’s mental state didn’t match reality",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Oops?After spending weeks breathlessly questioning President Joe Biden’s mental faculties in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Hur’s explosive report, some of America’s top news organizations on Tuesday effectively stated that Hur’s characterization of the commander-in-chief was off base.The Wall Street Journal declared that the transcripts of Biden’s deposition with Hur released on Tuesday painted “a more nuanced picture” than the report indicated. The New York Times found that Biden appeared “clearheaded,” despite having fumbled some dates. And The Washington Post concluded Biden “doesn’t come across as being as absent-minded as Hur has made him out to be.”In other words, the Hur report offered a misleading view of the president’s mental state. That’s a significant problem for news organizations, given that much of their recent coverage about Biden’s age was derived from that very report where Hur offered a wince-inducing depiction of the president as a “sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.”The acknowledgement from some, but not all, news outlets on Tuesday about the true nature of Biden’s deposition marked another embarrassing moment for the national press, which has floundered at pivotal moments in the lead up to the crucial 2024 presidential election.The deposition transcripts not only indicated that Biden appeared fairly sharp during his testimony, joking with investigators and retelling stories with granular detail, but that Hur was misleading in how he presented some of the information included in his report.As The NYT’s Charlie Savage noted on X, in one instance, “Based on a garbled moment, Hur claimed Biden forgot that the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan was an ally who shared his opposition to the surge. Hur omitted that a few minutes later, Biden brought up the ambassador again in a way that made clear he knew that.”Particularly jarring, was that at another point during the depositions, Hur actually went out of his way to praise Biden’s memory. “You have — appear to have a photographic understanding and, and recall of the house,” Hur told Biden, referencing the president’s Wilmington home.Strangely, that characterization of Biden didn’t find its way into his report — and, thus, the crush of ensuing news stories. Instead, Hur chose to portray the president as a mentally diminished elderly man who struggled to recall basic information during his deposition, raising alarm bells about whether he had the fitness to serve in the nation’s highest office.Hur’s characterization of Biden played directly into a years-long campaign waged by Biden’s political opponents and the powerful right-wing media machine to depict the president as a senile, aloof man.The special counsel’s report was something of a gift to outlets like Fox News, which used the special counsel’s characterization to validate its years of ugly attacks on Biden. Such outlets then pointed to the fact that Biden’s mental fitness was being covered by prominent news organizations, contending that the issue had grown so serious the supposed “liberal media” could no longer ignore it.To be fair to news organizations, they were faced with a thorny, difficult decision after the Hur report dropped. If they chose to dial back coverage, it could have looked like they were covering for Biden. On the other hand, leaning hard into the report, producing scores of stories and television segments about Hur’s characterization of Biden’s age, proved ultimately to be unwise as well.What news organizations can do now, however, is forcefully acknowledge that the deposition transcript poured cold water on Hur’s over-the-top characterization of Biden’s mental fitness. Given the extensive coverage in the prior weeks, which seeped into the national consciousness, it is not sufficient to only tacitly acknowledge the reality of the situation.﻿But don’t hold your breath that the news media will shout its findings from the mountain tops at the same volume and with the same vigor as it did after Hur’s report was released. While The NYT, The WaPo, The WSJ, and a few others commendably acknowledged that the deposition transcripts rendered a more nuanced picture of Biden than Hur offered in his report, other outlets did not.As Bill Grueskin, a renowned professor of professional practice at the Columbia Journalism School noted to me, “It’s very hard for someone who was involved in the coverage to critique their own methods. Because these things don’t always lend themselves to straightforward corrections, like misspelling a name. It has to do more with how a news story is framed so readers understand the incompleteness of it.”"

        "text": "Investigators with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating a fatal crash involving a Ford Mustang Mach-E equipped with advanced driving assistance technology.The Mach-E drove into the back of a Honda CR-V that was stopped in the road.“A team of investigators from the NTSB’s Special Investigations Branch of the Office of Highway Safety traveled to San Antonio to examine the wreckage and collect information about the accident site and sequence of events leading to the collision,” the NTSB said in a statement emailed to CNN.NHTSA also confirmed that it is investigating the same incident. The NHTSA investigation was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Federal investigators are looking at dozens of crashes involving so-called advanced driver assistance, or ADAS, systems. Most of the crashes involve Teslas. Tesla’s Autopilot system has been on the market longest and has the largest number of users. But crashes involving vehicles made by General Motors’ Cadillac, Hyundai’s Genesis luxury brand and Volvo are also being investigated, among many others, according to a list provided by NHTSA.ADAS systems handle basic driving tasks such as keeping the vehicle in its lane while maintaining a safe distance behind vehicles ahead, usually in highway driving only. Some systems, like Ford’s BlueCruise, allow drivers to remove their hands from the steering wheel and their feet from the pedals for long periods of time on specific US highways. But drivers are monitored using an interior camera to ensure they are paying attention to the road.Fourteen of these systems, including two from Ford, were recently rated by the private Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Eleven of the systems were rated as “Poor,” including Ford’s BlueCruise hands-free system, and its “Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop & Go and Lane Centering Assist,” which is similar but requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel.It is not immediately clear which system was in the vehicle that crashed in Texas.Ford did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation.IIHS criticized many of the ADAS systems it tested for failing to adequately monitor the driver’s attention and for not doing enough to keep the driver engaged.NTSB said a preliminary report on the crash will be available in 30 days but a final report into the crash will take one to two years. NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy has criticized NHTSA in the past for being too slow to monitor and regulate these technologies."

        "title": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day this year",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one.Put another way, to make 12 months’ worth of a man’s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months.In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign.That’s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today.The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity.The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women.And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field.But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women’s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women.Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues.While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time — for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year’s — the very fact that ﻿such a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women’s contributions at work.“The gender wage gap is a national disgrace,” said Jamila Taylor, IWPR’s president and CEO, in a statement. “Even in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it’s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.”The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs.There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates’ for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions.But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times.For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, “bar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work … [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.”Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming."

        "title": "Mortgage rates tumble for the second week in a row",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Mortgage rates dropped for the second week in a row, falling nearly a quarter of a percentage point over the past two weeks in the face of stronger-than-expected employment and inflation data.The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.74% in the week ending March 14, down from 6.88% the previous week, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the average 30-year fixed-rate was 6.60%.But while rates are expected to move around in the next few months, homebuyers shouldn’t expect a major drop.“Despite the recent dip, mortgage rates remain high as the market contends with the pressure of sticky inflation,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, in a statement. “In this environment, there is a good possibility that rates will stay higher for a longer period of time.”Over the past four months, mortgage rates have come down from their highest levels of last year: 7.79%. This has brought improved affordability for homebuyers who’ve been struggling in one of the least affordable markets in decades.But with February’s robust inflation readings and surprisingly strong job numbers, the economy seems to be running hotter than analysts and economists would like.Buyers continue to be exceptionally rate-sensitive. After rates dropped slightly last week, more would-be buyers came to the market. Applications for mortgages were up 7% in the week ending March 8 from the week before, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.The Federal Reserve’s historic campaign of rate hikes to rein in inflation has brought the measure down considerably over the past two years. But Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank needs to see more consistent evidence that inflation is improving before initiating rate cuts.Fed rate cuts are not expected before the summer and may not come until the fall. For a housing market that came into the year thinking cuts could come as early as March, that delay is keeping mortgage rates elevated.While the Federal Reserve’s actions don’t directly set mortgage rates, they do influence them.Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasuries, which move based on a combination of anticipation about the Fed actions, what the Fed actually does and investors’ reactions.Reduction in the pace of inflation should eventually lead to lower mortgage rates, Jones said.“In the short-term, mortgage rates are probably not going to fall much further this month,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright Multiple Listing Service, in a note.Some homebuyers are just happy to see rates that are much lower now than they were last fall when they hovered near 8%.“Any downward trend in rates later this spring will bring more buyers — and sellers — into the market,” Sturtevant said.Rates are roughly a full percentage point lower than they were at their peak last year.In October, when the median home price was $391,800, according to the National Association of Realtors, and the average mortgage rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate loan was 7.79% with the homebuyer making a 20% down payment, the typical monthly payment was $2,254.This week a home at that price, on which a buyer made a 20% down payment with a mortgage rate of 6.74%, will see a monthly payment of $2,031 — about $220 less.Rising home prices may eat into some of that savings, however.Currently there is a bit more inventory coming on the market, as is usual during the peak spring homebuying season. But even as affordability improves slightly and mortgage applications rise, some buyers may decide to hold off, hoping that mortgage rates will move even lower, Jones said. But either choice — buying now or waiting — comes with tradeoffs.For one, falling mortgage rates aren’t a given and for another, prices are expected to rise.“Spring buyers may see higher mortgage rates, but summer buyers are likely to see higher home prices,” said Jones."

        "title": "UAW seeks breakthrough as it files union vote at Volkswagen’s Tennessee plant",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The United Auto Workers union’s effort to organize the American plants of foreign automakers just took a major step forward as it filed for a representation election for the more than 4,000 hourly workers at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.If the union were to win the vote, those workers would be the first current employees of a foreign automaker to be represented by a union. The union has announced a broad-based campaign to win representation at the American plants of 13 nonunion automakers.The UAW has faced declining membership over the decades partly because the traditional Big Three automakers lost more than half of the US market to foreign brands. While unionized Stellantis is based in Europe, its plants that the UAW represents – those that make Jeeps, Ram trucks, Dodge and Chrysler vehicles – were organized by the union when they were part of Chrysler Corp.While the union represented some foreign automakers’ plants in the past – including a Volkswagen plant in Pennsylvania and a Mitsubishi plant in Illinois, and a joint venture in California operated by Toyota and General Motors – those plants have long since closed. So winning the right to represent workers at the current foreign plants is a key to the UAW’s efforts to reverse its decline in memberhip.The current campaign includes 10 foreign automakers with American plants – BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, Volvo as well as Volkswagen – and three electric vehicle makers that have US plants that are not unionized – Tesla, Rivian and Lucid.The union said about 150,000 hourly employees work at 36 nonunion auto plants operated by the companies it is targeting in this campaign. That is slightly more than the union’s representation at the three unionized automakers, which have about 145,000 UAW members between them.The union recently won an immediate 11% pay increase for its members following strikes at the three unionized US automakers – General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which makes cars and trucks under the Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands. Pay increases are expected to reach more than 30% over the life of the contract that runs through April 2028. Those contract gains prompted a number of nonunion automakers to announce double-digit US pay raises of their own – including Volkswagen.The VW Chattanooga plant is the only factory operated by VW that does not have union representation. But the union lost two previous votes when it attempted to organize the plant – in 2014 and again in 2019. But the union gained ground, winning 48% of the vote in the 2019 election.“We respect our workers’ right to a democratic process and to determine who should represent their interests,” said a statement from VW. “Volkswagen is proud of our working environment in Chattanooga that provides some of the best paying jobs in the area.”Unsuccessful votes were held over the years at some other nonunion plants as well, but many of the organizing efforts have never reached the point in which the union has filed for a vote.The union said it will not disclose what percentage of workers have signed cards requesting the election, but it described the percentage as a “super majority.” The union had spoken about getting the support of 70% of the workers before filing for a vote.“We are voting yes for our union because we want Volkswagen to be successful,” said Victor Vaughn, a logistics team member at VW, in a comment included in the union’s statement. “Volkswagen has spent billions of dollars expanding in Chattanooga, but right now safety is a major issue in our plant.”Vaughn said recently he was almost hit by four 500-plus pound crates while driving to deliver parts. He said no one in management inquired about the incident.“VW has partnered with unionized workforces around the world to make their plants safe and successful,” he said. “That’s why we’re voting for a voice at Volkswagen here in Chattanooga.”Unions often wait for more than 50% of employees to voice support for a union before filing for a vote. Once the election process starts, management often holds mandatory meetings with staff to make the case against union representation, and that convinces some earlier supporters of the union to end their support."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "China’s key real estate sector hasn’t shown much improvement following a flurry of government measures taken to boost the industry, even as other parts of the economy seem to be stabilizing.New property sales reached a total of 1.06 trillion yuan ($147 billion) in the first two months of this year, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday. That’s equivalent to a fall of 29.3% compared to the same period in 2023.The drop also marks a much faster pace of decline from the year-ago period, when new property sales dipped just 0.1%.Property investment fell 9% in the January-to-February period, which was faster than the 5.7% decrease registered during the same period last year.“The correction in property construction is still in its early stages,” Capital Economics analysts said in a research note on Monday. “We expect it [property construction] to halve in the coming years, pulling down economic growth over the medium-term.”However, other parts of the economy — including consumption, industrial production and infrastructure investment — appear to show improvement thanks to a holiday spending boom, strong exports and state-led infrastructure push.Retail sales increased 5.5% in January-February from the same period a year earlier, which was slightly higher than an expected 5.2% increase from a Reuters poll of analysts.Catering services, telecoms, cigarettes and tobacco, and sports and entertainment services registered the highest growth in sales.But it is still uncertain if the improvement will continue. “Consumers were buoyed temporarily by festivities-related spending at this start of the year,” said Louise Loo, China economist at Oxford Economics.Industrial output jumped 7% during the first two months of this year from the same period in 2023, beating the 5% growth forecast in the Reuters poll.That’s in line with the strong Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index released by S&P Global earlier this month. The index, which focuses on export-oriented manufacturing firms in mainland China, rose to 50.9 in February, up from 50.8 in January, marking a fourth straight month of expansion.The growth in factory output might be driven by strong exports demand. Separate customs figures showed that China’s exports jumped 7.1% in the January-to-February period from a year ago, well above market expectations.Investment in fixed assets — such as factories, roads, and power grids — increased 4.2% in the first two months of this year, surpassing analyst estimates.This is mainly driven by state-led investment, the NBS data showed.Still, the property downturn and weak domestic demand call for more policy support to sustain growth.“In the absence of decisive consumption-related stimulus this year, we think it would be difficult to sustain a robust consumer spending pace,” Loo said.Some of the government’s new initiatives to spur consumer spending — including the replacement of old durable goods, such as cars and home appliances, with new ones— would be “hugely beneficial,” she added.“Economic outlook in [the second quarter] is still quite uncertain,” said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.“While exports helped to partially offset the weak domestic momentum [at the start of the year], a sustainable recovery requires more policy support, particularly from the fiscal side,” he said."

        "text": "Running to the tail of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner is an umbilical cord carrying a rapid play-by-play of virtually every flight feature.The data, which totals more than a thousand parameters, is swiftly saved electronically into the flight data recorder (FDR), one of the so-called black boxes that aviation safety investigators say offers critical facts when piecing together an incident, like the mid-air plunge on LATAM Airlines flight 800 earlier this week that injured 50 people.The FDR and cockpit voice recorder from the LATAM flight should provide evidence to prove or refute the pilot’s initial explanation, as relayed by a passenger who spoke to CNN: that cockpit displays briefly went blank and the pilot lost control of the plane. It could also show whether the yoke was pushed forward, sending the plane rapidly downward — a scenario The Wall Street Journal reported the investigators are probing, and which may have involved a flight attendant hitting a switch while serving pilots a meal.“There’s absolutely no way this will be a mystery,” said Peter Goelz, who led investigations as managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, and is now a CNN aviation analyst. “The recorder will indicate if something was starting and what happened.”Regardless of what the FDR shows, the contents of the orange steel box with reflective tape typically mounted in the rear of the plane, which is meant to reduce the risk of damage in a crash, have proven pivotal in past airplane investigations.In 2015, investigators used the FDR to conclude that a pilot of Germanwings flight 9525 deliberately slammed the airliner into a mountain and ruled out potential airplane malfunctions. The FDR recorded 600 parameters onto a modern memory card and investigators extracted the data despite its exposure to extreme temperatures in the crash.Sophisticated laboratories like those run by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and its counterparts in France, Australia and the United Kingdom, can reconstruct even broken memory cards and then line up the data with audio feeds into the cockpit voice recorder. The bright orange color of the container that houses the recorder, a well as locator beacons, help searchers locate the recorders. The devices found underwater are typically transported to the lab inside water before being carefully dried, Goelz said.The 787 Dreamliner — one of Boeing’s more recently developed aircraft — feeds data into the flight data recorder through a system called the Common Data Network, which some compare to the human body’s central nervous system. It first flew in 2009 and uses new-at-the-time data transfer technologies.US regulations specify about 90 parameters that must be fed into the black box. The list includes the thrust for each engine, temperature, flap settings, and the plane’s direction. International Civil Aviation Organization standards further specify how often and detailed the data must be. Altitude, for example, is recorded four times per second and accurate to the half-degree.The data now encompasses “every parameter you can imagine — like notes on a musical score,” said Kathleen Bangs, a spokeswoman for the aviation tracking site FlightAware, and a former pilot. “When they take all that data and lay it all together, and put this musical score together, that’s when you get really get the full picture.”But the black boxes are not the only tools investigators will have. Many components of modern planes, such as the engines, also contain computer chips that track detailed data.Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is equipment on aircraft that transmits real-time data including the airplane’s position. The Federal Aviation Administration used this data after ungrounding Boeing’s 737 Max in late 2020 to track every Max flight.Data is also sent to airlines using the Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), which transmits automated and manually entered messages between airlines and airplanes using radio waves and satellite links.Some aircraft also carry a Quick Access Recorder (QAR) that is not hardened like the FDR but tracks the same data. The QAR can be easily hooked up to a laptop and allow airline employees to download plane performance information for analysis.But it wasn’t always this way.When United Airlines flight 585 crashed shortly before landing in March 1991, the FDR held five data points: direction, speed, altitude, G-force, and whether the radio microphone was keyed to transmit. When US Air flight 427 crashed three years later near Pittsburgh, the FDR recorded 11 parameters.“If these airplanes had been equipped with FDRs with additional parameters, that information would have undoubtedly allowed quick identification of critical control surface movements and their sources and other airplane system conditions that could have been involved in the loss of airplane control,” the NTSB said in a 1999 report referencing those two crashes. “Thus, investigators would have been able to more quickly rule out certain factors, when warranted, and focus on other areas.”The NTSB recommended regulators increase the requirements, which ultimately took effect in the early 2000s.Aircraft cockpits may one day contain a new generation of recording devices: video cameras. The NTSB called for the cameras, saying it could help investigators understand the moments before an incident. Some unions oppose the cameras, saying there are more effective and less invasive ways to obtain enough data. US lawmakers abandoned a plan to include a cockpit video camera when crafting this year’s expansive FAA legislation."

        "title": "Hacked health care giant makes progress in recovery, but concerns for small clinics remain",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The health insurance billing system in the United States is stabilizing following an unprecedented cyberattack on a key company last month, but smaller health clinics may still need help to ensure they can stay in business, senior Biden administration officials said Monday after meeting with health care executives.Ninety-five percent of Change Healthcare’s health insurance claims are now being processed, the insurance billing firm that has been roiled by the Feb. 21 hack, a senior administration official told reporters in an update on the federal response to the hack.“[O]ur real focus is making sure we don’t get to the point where there are issues with access to care,” the official said in a press call conducted on background, meaning reporters cannot cite officials by name. “And the way to do that is make sure you keep liquidity in the system.”“We are still hearing from small rural safety net providers who need cash assistance,” another senior official said.The cyberattack forced Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealthGroup, to take computer systems that handle electronic payments and insurance claims offline in what the American Hospital Association (AHA) has called the most significant cyberattack in US health care history. Change Healthcare says it handles one in every three patient records in the US.Change Healthcare restored its electronic payments platform on March 15 and “is proceeding with payer implementations,” UnitedHealthGroup said in a statement on Monday. The statement indicated 99% of the company’s pharmacy network services are back online and the company is working on the rest.Change Healthcare will release “medical claims preparation software” to thousands of customers over the next several days, the parent firm said, touting an “important step in the resumption of services.”But the full financial impact of the hack is still unknown. US officials told reporters they don’t have that data.“Billions of dollars” stopped flowing to health care providers because of the hack, according to AHA, which represents thousands of hospitals across the country.The fallout has been acute for people trying to get their prescriptions and for doctors trying to run their health practices. CNN interviewed a woman in Colorado who paid $1,600 out of pocket, at least temporarily, for Paxlovid because her insurance couldn’t be billed, and the chief financial officer of a cancer-treatment clinic in Oregon who worried she would be forced to close her doors.In meetings over the last week, senior White House and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials have urged UnitedHealthGroup executives and those from other health care firms to be clear about what forms of financing are available to health providers during the disruption.The unprecedented pressure on a hacked US health care firm won’t go away with the restoration of billing services. HHS has opened an investigation into whether Change Healthcare has complied with federal law to protect patient data."

        "title": "This social app prohibits edited photos to encourage users to be more authentic. It’s growing fast",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Scoot over, Facebook and Instagram.There’s a newer photo-sharing app – and it’s not like other social media platforms.The app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance.We joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it.BeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users – at least 65% – have signed up this calendar year.As its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they’re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life.It has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that’s what people will see.The result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms.The concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it’s time to “BeReal.” That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you’re doing, no matter how mundane.There’s no set time – the notification comes at random times of the day – adding to the app’s mystique.“Push notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,” the company said in a statement. “It’s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it’s not random.”That means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you’re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo – a selfie and one showing what’s in front of you. (BeReal doesn’t permit videos yet.)The result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things – lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner.With only one post a day, there’s no clutter of friends’ pictures to mindlessly scroll through. You can only see friends’ posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time.Georgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August.“What I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. … solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,” says Telerski, a junior majoring in government.Telerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms.“I try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,” he says. “I think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.”When you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what’s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie.The app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you’re ready.BeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity.BeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via its college ambassador program, which allows students to host events that educate others about the app.Telerski believes the app is popular because it’s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online.“I have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,” he says.Morgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend’s suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people’s lives.“It’s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren’t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,” she says. “It’s something different.”In a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create “an alternative to addictive social networks” that focus on amassing influence, it says.“BeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,” the company says. “BeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.”The app doesn’t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos.But some users may still try to curate their lives on the app.“There is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,” Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says.“It is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,” he says. “BeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.”The young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps.Nott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal – and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well.Telerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says.“For those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,” he says.“Think about what social media was originally intended for – real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.”"

        "title": "OpenAI’s wild week. How the Sam Altman story unfolded",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week’s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating.Sam Altman — the leader of one of the world’s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the most visible figure in the fledgling industry — was fired Friday night by the startup’s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he’s back as the company’s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision.The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot.If you’re just catching up, here’s what you missed from a week so incredible you’d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI’s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public.Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board.Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO.OpenAI’s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman’s ouster just minutes before the board’s announcement.Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he “loved working with such talented people” and that he would have “more to say about what’s next later.”Brockman promptly quit. “Please don’t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,” Brockman said in a Friday post on X. “Greater things coming soon.”A key factor in the CEO’s firing was tension between Altman, who favored developing AI more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events.Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture.OpenAI’s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return.By Sunday afternoon, Altman was back at OpenAI’s headquarters — this time with a guest badge — to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman’s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO.But those talks broke down.As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon’s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI’s chief technology officer.In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as “a once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman’s firing.But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company’s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met.Altman posted on X, saying, “we have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i’m so excited. one team, one mission.”The drama was far from over. The Verge reported Monday afternoon that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign.And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was “open to both options” when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft.“Look, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,” Nadella said. “We chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.”Altman was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI’s CEO, the company said on X.“We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo.“We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said.In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm’s “strong partnership” with Microsoft.It’s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman’s return. Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work … I’m glad to have been a part of the solution.”Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X.Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI.“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”"

        "title": "Wait, is TikTok really Chinese?",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The future of TikTok is mired in uncertainty in the United States after the House of Representatives passed a bill last week which could ultimately lead to the wildly popular video app being banned.US lawmakers are concerned about Beijing’s influence over the app, and are trying to force its Chinese owner to give up control.In particular, they worry that TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, could share data with the Chinese government or manipulate content displayed on its platform. So far, there’s little evidence to support these concerns.TikTok has never operated in mainland China — a fact that its Singaporean CEO, Shou Chew, has repeatedly touted when grilled by American officials. So, just how “Chinese” is it, and why does that matter?On the face of it, the answer would appear to be “no.” It was first incorporated in California in April 2015, according to US court documents.TikTok has never existed in mainland China, though the app was available in Hong Kong until July 2020, when it pulled out shortly after Beijing imposed a controversial national security law in the city.At the time, the app was trying to distance itself from China in the face of growing pressure from the Trump administration.In China, there is a different version of TikTok: a sister app called Douyin.It launched before TikTok and became a viral sensation in the massive mainland market. Its powerful algorithm became the foundation for TikTok and is key to its global success.In March 2023, CEO Chew was repeatedly pressed by US lawmakers on whether TikTok was Chinese. He didn’t answer the question directly, saying only that the app was not available in the country and that it was headquartered in Los Angles and Singapore.But TikTok is ultimately owned, through a complex multi-layered corporate structure, by ByteDance, a privately owned technology giant.The app is owned by TikTok LLC, a limited liability company incorporated in Delaware and based in Culver City, California. The LLC is controlled by TikTok Ltd, which is registered in the Cayman Islands and based in Shanghai. That firm is ultimately owned by ByteDance Ltd, also incorporated in the Cayman Islands and based in Beijing.ByteDance’s website shows that the company developed TikTok as a global short video product and formally launched it in May 2017. Six months later, it acquired rival Musical.ly and subsequently merged it with the main platform.According to TikTok’s own website, its subsidiaries around the world are all structured under Bytedance Ltd.Definitely.ByteDance was founded in 2012 in Beijing by Zhang Yiming and Liang Rubo, who were college roommates at Tianjin’s Nankai University, according to company information and Zhang’s public speeches.It has been based in the Chinese capital since then. In 2021, Zhang announced he would step down as CEO of ByteDance and handed the reins to Liang.ByteDance has more than 110,000 employees globally. Besides TikTok, it owns a number of popular Chinese apps such as Douyin, news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, video-sharing platform Xigua.At last year’s congressional hearing, Chew didn’t directly answer any questions about whether ByteDance is a Chinese company either.He only said ByteDance is a Chinese-founded private company operating many businesses in China, but is “global” in nature.Chew added that 60% of ByteDance is owned by global institutional investors such as the Carlyle Group, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group, while 20% of the firm is owned by Zhang and 20% owned by employees around the world. Three of the company’s five board members are Americans, he said.Chew has emphatically told Congress that ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government.However, like most other Chinese companies, ByteDance is legally compelled to establish an in-house Communist Party committee composed of employees who are party members.Zhang Fuping, the company’s vice president and editor-in-chief, serves as the secretary of the party committee. The committee often holds sessions to study the party and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. One session in 2018 was joined by Zhang Yiming and his management team, according to the Beijing government.Also, like its competitors, ByteDance has had to allow the Chinese government to take a so-called “golden share” in one of its key subsidiaries.That means the Chinese government now owns 1% of Beijing Douyin Information Service, which is the domestic Chinese unit of Bytedance. Wu Shugang, an official from the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet watchdog and censor, sits on its board.Analysts have said the “golden shares” provide a way for the Chinese government to get more directly involved with the day-to-day businesses of tech companies, including in the content they provide to the public.Chew has admitted that the “golden share” exists. But he said it was for the purpose of internet licensing for the Chinese business.ByteDance said on its website that it’s a common arrangement for companies operating news and information platforms in China and doesn’t affect its operations outside the country.As a China-based company, ByteDance is subject to a myriad of national intelligence, data security and cybersecurity laws.In 2018, China amended its National Intelligence Law, which requires any organization or citizen to support, assist and cooperate with national intelligence work.That means ByteDance is legally bound to help with gathering intelligence.In 2021, China introduced a new data security law, which applies to data processing activities conducted outside of the country that may “harm the national security or public interests.”There is also a cybersecurity law in China, which says the state will take measures to monitor, prevent and handle cybersecurity risks and threats “arising both within and outside the PRC’s territory.”These vague and broad laws apply to technology companies and may be used to regulate them.Yes, Beijing has the legal ability to do so and has already indicated it would.In August 2020, following an attempt by the Trump administration to force the sale of TikTok, Beijing revised its export control rules to cover a variety of technologies it deemed sensitive, including technology that appears similar to TikTok’s personalized information recommendation services.A few years later, in early 2023, a Commerce Ministry spokeswoman said in the government’s first direct response to the matter that China would oppose any forced sale of TikTok.This is because a sale or divestiture of the app would involve “exporting technology” and had to be approved by the Chinese government, said Shu Yuting, the spokeswoman.Beijing has not indicated any change to this position since that time."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "MrBeast, the popular video creator known for big philanthropic gestures and extreme stunts, is making the leap from YouTube to Amazon Prime with a new reality competition show, Amazon announced Monday in a news release.The show, called “Beast Games,” will be released on Prime Video and feature “over 1,000 contestants, $5,000,000 prize, and many other world records,” the creator, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, said Monday in a post of X, formerly known as Twitter. It will be “the largest game show in history” with the most contestants and the biggest cash prize, he said in a podcast interview with “The Colin and Samir Show.”Netflix previously claimed both records for its “Squid Game: The Challenge” reality competition series based on the massively popular dystopian show by the same name. The show, which was released in November, featured 456 participants vying for a cash prize of $4.56 million.Donaldson said that his decision to host his show on Amazon stemmed in part because other platforms wouldn’t give him the same level of creative control. He is set to both host and executive produce the show, according to Amazon.“MrBeast has captured the attention and imagination of fans of all ages, from all walks of life, and all over the world,” Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios, said in a statement. “We are excited to work with Jimmy and his talented team to bring his brilliant, high production, and stakes-raising concepts to Beast Games for our global customers to experience.”While the show will feature upwards of six hours of content, Donaldson wants to bring a sense of YouTube-like authenticity to the non-scripted show.“It will look nothing like a normal game-show. It will have the Beast feel but just make it more high-budget,” he said in the interview.MrBeast is one of the most popular YouTube channels on the platform, with 245 million subscribers. In recent years, each of his videos easily surpasses 100 million views, and at times has pushed half a billion. In addition to his stunt videos, Donaldson has garnered attention for his unique method of philanthropy: in one video, called “1,000 blind people see for the first time,” he pays for patients’ cataract surgery. As the patients emerge from cataract eye surgery, some in tears, he hands some of them a suitcase filled with cash.“Here’s $10,000 to make your day better,” he tells one woman.In recent years, Donaldson has expanded into ventures beyond content creation and philanthropy. In November 2020, he opened his first burger restaurant, MrBeast Burger, near his hometown of Greenville, North Carolina. Since then, the chain has expanded to nearly every US state and several Canadian provinces.Donaldson told Time Magazine in February that he brings in about $600 million to $700 million annually, but reinvests this income into creating his high-budget videos."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Dollar General is backing away from the self-checkout trend in retail.The company is pulling out self-checkout stands in 300 stores that have the highest levels of shoplifting and merchandise losses. In 9,000 other stores, Dollar General is converting some or all of its self-checkout registers to regular checkout with cashiers. And in another 4,500 or so stores, Dollar General is limiting self-checkout to purchases of five items or less.Dollar General said the moves will help it reduce shrink — the retail industry term for shoplifting, employee theft, damaged products, administrative errors, online fraud and other factors. Dollar General has skeleton staffing levels in stores and is more vulnerable to shoplifting and other merchandise losses than many other retailers, retail analysts say.“We believe these actions have the potential to have a material and positive impact on shrink,” CEO Todd Vasos said on a call with analysts Thursday. “Shrink” was mentioned 37 times on the call.Vasos said Dollar General made the decision after using artificial intelligence to analyze hundreds of thousands of purchases at self-checkout. The company said it was able to determine which stores had the highest levels of stolen merchandise and mis-scanned items.Dollar General is the latest retailer to backtrack on self-checkout.The company had aggressively expanded self-checkout stations, adding them to more than half of its approximately 20,000 stores. The company also piloted stores with only self-checkout options and no cashier lanes. Like other retailers, Dollar General bet self-checkout would reduce its labor costs and speed up checkout for customers.But Dollar General recently has been re-assigning workers to the front of its stores to ring customers up, both due to shrink and other issues with the technology. Retailers lose more possible sales with self-checkout than full-service cashiers, both from intentional shoplifting and honest errors by customers.One study of retailers in the United States, Britain and other European countries found that companies with self-checkout lanes and apps had a loss rate of about 4%, more than double the industry average.Booths, a British supermarket chain, said it’s removing self-checkout stations in all but two of its 28 stores. Walmart removed self-checkout machines at some stores in New Mexico earlier this year. ShopRite pulled them at a Delaware store after customer complaints.Five Below, the discount toy retailer, said that shrink at stores with more self-checkout lanes was higher, and it will increase the number of staffed cash registers in new locations.Other retailers are making tweaks to self-checkout policies.On Thursday, Target announced it’s rolling out a new “express self-checkout” with limits of 10 items or less at most of its stores. Target is also opening more traditional lanes staffed by cashiers."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Joann, the 81-year-old fabric and craft retailer, has filed for bankruptcy as it struggles with customers cutting back on discretionary spending.In a statement Monday, the Ohio-based company said it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and has secured $132 million in fresh funding that helps reduce its debt in half, which had ballooned to $1 billion. Its roughly 850 stores and website will remain open for business.Joann’s revenue has been on the decline in recent years, except for a brief pandemic boom during the height of Covid when people stuck at home spent more money on arts and crafts. However, that has since faded, and inflation has soared, prompting customers to spend less on non-essential items.“This agreement is a significant step forward in addressing Joann’s capital structure needs, and it will provide us with the financial resources and flexibility necessary to continue to deliver best-in-class product assortments and enhance the customer experience wherever they are shopping with us,” said Scott Sekella, the company’s chief financial officer, in the company statement.Joann’s stock was delisted from the Nasdaq and will become privately owned following the bankruptcy process, which it expects to happen as fast as next month.“The bankruptcy of Joann has been looming for a long time and was always a matter of when, rather than if,” said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst for GlobalData, in a note Monday. “The bankruptcy process will now allow the arts and crafts chain to receive an infusion of cash at the same time as streamlining its operations and reducing debt levels.”Saunders said that its customers are increasingly shopping at lower-priced rivals, like Hobby Lobby, because of “weakening store standards and declining customer service levels, partly because of staffing cuts, have made stores less desirable.”"

        "title": "VW is reviving a storied American brand to sell electric SUVs",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "When Volkswagen decided to relaunch the Scout SUV brand it took a very unusual step. It created a new subsidiary company to design, build and sell vehicles targeted, almost entirely, at a single market: the United States.Its status as a subsidiary of Volkswagen Group, similar to Audi and Porsche, gives some indication of just how important this project is to VW. The revived and revamped Scout Motors will introduce its new brand of all-electric off-road-capable SUVs, kind of like Rivian.But VW is banking on something Rivian doesn’t have, a backstory. An avid fanbase in America fondly remembers Scout. Here, it was one of the pioneering SUV brands, and its original models are collectibles today.So, just as it’s doing with the Volkswagen ID. Buzz, an electric update of the classic hippie bus, VW is touching on nostalgia to reach a new generation of car buyers. This time, though, it’s an American thing. Germans wouldn’t understand. Or so you might think.“We really do understand the American spirit but not only that we also actively contribute to it,” Volkswagen Group chief executive Oliver Blume said while discussing the company’s global earnings Wednesday. “What’s rather promising is the revival of the Scout cult brand. This is how we are laying the foundation for an electric SUV and pickup brand in the largest and most profitable US segment.”Still, Scout could have been introduced as simply a sub-brand, just one or two models, under the popular VW brand. Instead, it’s breaking out entirely on its own.“It is a unique decision to make but not one that seems too crazy to me, especially for Volkswagen given that it’s in a segment that they are not traditionally strong in or well known for – and given the brand recognition for Scout in the United States from enthusiasts,” said Erin Keating, an industry analyst with Cox Automotive,But while VW may have bought the name, the new company’s chief executive is already knocking competitors as unoriginal.“Basically, the entire SUV market is an imitation of Scout, not only what the product is but the name,” said Scott Keogh, chief executive of Scout. “So, Trailblazer, Blazer, Discovery, 4Runner and Explorer, just keep going. They basically took the Scout name and did a synonym search and spit it out.”The original Scout SUVs and trucks were made by International Harvester in the 1960s and ’70s. They were the commercial truck maker’s foray into the passenger vehicle market. VW came to own the trademark for the defunct brand in 2021 when it purchased Navistar, a successor company to International Harvester. A year later, VW announced Scout’s planned rebirth.The VW Group has a 5% market share for vehicle sales in the US with the mainstream Volkswagen brand accounting for a little less than half of that. The rest comes from Audi, Porsche, Bentley and a tiny bit from Lamborghini. Volkswagen Group executives frequently refer to the North American market as a source of “untapped potential.”Scout Motors could be a key part of tapping some of that potential, according to Dave Mondragon, a former Ford executive who’s now an industry analyst with S&P Global Mobility. But VW will need to make some difficult steps before it can get there.“First, attract new customers to your brand who wouldn’t have shopped the brand before. Dealers like that,” he said in a blog post on S&P’s website. “Second, it’s about retaining customers already in your fold, but [who] may migrate out because you don’t have these types of vehicles.”It’s still not clear exactly how Scout’s vehicles will be sold in the US. Scout Motors hasn’t announced, yet, whether they’ll be sold through VW dealers or through an entirely separate dealer network or even just direct to the customer, the way startups such as Rivian and Tesla do.Scout CEO Keogh, who used to head Volkswagen North America, insists that Scout, too, is a startup despite being owned by one of the world’s largest automakers. This status, he said, gives Scout the flexibility to do whatever is needed.“Being a startup in the position we’re in, we challenge ourselves on pivots almost each and every day,” Keogh said. “And we have the ability, right? Because we’re a startup and lean. We don’t have all of these fixed positions.”Being a separate subsidiary also opens up some options for VW to share the financial burden and the potential risks.“If we want to pursue a strategic investor, if we want to approach the capital markets, if we want to go to an IPO those strategic doors are open,” Keough said.Scout is hiring for just about every position you can think of, he said, from human resources to manufacturing and engineering.Most surprisingly, Scout is investing $2 billion in its own factory. Construction work is underway in Blythewood, South Carolina, where, Keogh said, Scout has access to a good range of suppliers. Volvo, Mercedes and BMW already have long-established factories in South Carolina.The company also has its own design center in Novi, Michigan, with its own head of design, Chris Benjamin, who previously worked for Mercedes, Volvo and Stellantis, which owns Jeep.The Scout EVs will mix nostalgic cues without being overly retro, Keogh insists. So far the company has shown only vague silhouette images of the SUV and truck. The company has tested models showing just the general shape to customers and the feedback has been good, he said.The new Scout will be different than the classic ones, of course. These vehicles will feature modern technology and, most crucially, they’ll be all-electric. That part of the plan has not changed even as EV sales growth has dampened in the US market. Keogh said he isn’t worried.“I look at people who own and drive electric vehicles and they love them,” Keogh said.The industry faces challenges with battery costs and charging infrastructure, he allowed, but those things will be worked out. Scout’s parent company, Volkswagen, is building its own EV battery plant in Canada and a battery engineering lab in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And the EV charging company Electrify America is also VW-owned.The vehicles are expected to go on sale in early 2026, costing around $45,000. That will put the SUV in competition with the Tesla Model Y, the Ford Mach-E, and, most directly, Rivian’s new R2 SUV, another electric off-roader that’s expected to hit the market around the same time.If there is any company that could do this and make it work, it’s Volkswagen, said Keating, who used to work for VW. The company successfully manages a number of different brands around the world often finely tuned to different markets. VW even relaunched Bugatti from, literally, nothing but a disused trademark."

        "title": "Surging gas prices just hit a significant milestone",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Gas price inflation is back.For the first time since late last year, prices at the pump are now higher on a year-over-year basis. It’s a trend that industry experts expect to continue in the coming weeks and months, especially if Russian oil facilities continue to get hit by drone attacks.This is an unwanted development for consumers heading into the spring. It’s also a problem for White House and Federal Reserve officials hoping to declare victory over inflation.The recent jump in gas prices is already causing headaches on the inflation front. Gas was the main culprit behind last week’s hotter-than-expected consumer price index and a disappointing wholesale inflation report.All of this is casting doubt on when the Fed will be able to start cutting interest rates. Hopes for a March rate cut have faded, and investors are now betting on June or July.“Gas prices are going to keep going up,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. “This is going to cost the consumer more money. And that of course is not good for the administration.”The national average price for regular gas climbed to $3.47 a gallon on Monday, according to AAA. That’s up from $3.45 a year ago and the highest price since Halloween.The last time gas prices were up on a year-over-year basis was late December 2023, according to AAA.The highest recorded price for unleaded gas was in June of 2022, when a gallon averaged $5.02, according to AAA.The national average has jumped by seven cents in the past week and 19 cents over the past month. Gas prices are up by 40 cents since mid-January.Much of this late winter increase in prices is normal.It happens every year as refineries shut down for maintenance and switch over to more expensive summer fuel. Demand for gas also increases as people drive more in the warmer weather and longer days.But refinery outages caused by extreme cold this winter have also contributed to the gas price jump.Another problem: Russian energy infrastructure has been targeted in the Russia-Ukraine war.Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, told CNN that recent drone attacks on oil refineries deep inside Russia are boosting gasoline and oil prices.“It appears pretty clear that Ukrainians have discovered the best way to attack Vladimir Putin is to attack him in his wallet. That means knocking out refineries,” Kloza said. “It’s a wildcard we’ve never had to deal with before.”Kloza noted there is growing speculation that Russia will need to take the unprecedented step of importing gasoline to meet internal demand for fuel.“If they continue to target petroleum infrastructure, you could see global price rise higher,” said Kloza.And the concerns about Russia’s energy facilities is on top of the Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. Those attacks have forced some oil tankers to be rerouted away from the region, adding time and costs to the voyage.US oil prices climbed nearly 1% to $81.70 a barrel on Monday, leaving crude 20% more expensive than this point last year.Meanwhile, OPEC+, the producer group led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, continues to restrain supply in a bid to boost prices. OPEC+ recently agreed to keep its production cuts in place through June.Kloza noted that one problem for the White House is that some battleground states are at risk of seeing significantly higher gas prices.Drivers in Michigan, for instance, are now paying an average of $3.65 a gallon, nearly 20 cents higher than at this point last year, according to AAA.“People have this visceral reaction to higher gas prices and they look to fix blame,” said Kloza. “But this is all about OPEC+ and drones, not the Biden administration.”Still, the good news is that analysts are not forecasting a spike in gas prices like the one that drove the national average above $5 a gallon in mid-2022.The United States is pumping more oil than any country in history and OPEC+ has the firepower to add supply, if needed.Unless there’s a major hurricane that strikes US Gulf Coast refineries, Kloza does not expect gas prices to hit $4 a gallon this year."

        "title": "The average tax refund is over $3,000. Here are 7 ways to put it to good use",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS.Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there’s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you’re also owed a refund from your state government.That money may feel like a windfall, and it’s easy to squander it on a lot of little things.But if you’re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you’ll enjoy the seventh the most.If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down.At such sky-high rates, “the debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,” said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients.Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people’s awareness of how much money they’re paying in interest over time doesn’t always register.“What I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they’re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. … They don’t understand how much interest they’re paying,” Russ said.For example, if you’re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 — and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com’s calculator.You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund.When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don’t have at least three months’ worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000.Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks.If you have high-rate debt and you’re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund.Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you’re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job — such as on your car — he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt.If you’re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you’re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. “It can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,” Russ said.You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you’re saving yourself an extra 7% ﻿or so in interest on the portion of the principal you’re paying down, Bronnenkant noted.If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you’re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years.(And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older.Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great. But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, ﻿Bronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2.(For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.)Speaking of retirement savings, if you’re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier.Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have.For instance, say you’re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000).“You want to get the max match from your employer,” Bronnenkant said.If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds.The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds.But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you’re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance.If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live.Unless you’re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy.“Sometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,” Russ said. “You can set aside some of the money to have fun.”"

        "title": "Top soccer clubs are using an AI-powered app to scout future stars",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to “democratize” talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app.Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them.Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch.The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills.“We’re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts’] time,” said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app.“To say [to scouts], ‘Go over to this place today because there’s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard’ — that’s going to be the best use of your time.’”It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract with EPL team Bournemouth in 2021.Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app — which fully launched in September 2023 — according to Felton-Thomas.Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year.Felton-Thomas said the “lion’s share” of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for “tier one” sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid.The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at $2.7 billion in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research.Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods.“It’s more about evolution than revolution,” Felton-Thomas explained.“We can’t tell you when that player’s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he’s 2-0 down? What happens when someone’s shouting at him? What happens when he’s just made a massive mistake?”“We’ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you’re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.”While football remains ai.io’s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports.“You think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,” Felton-Thomas told CNN."

        "title": "Fox News sued by family of Ukrainian journalist killed while covering war over ‘reckless and negligent conduct’",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Fox News is the subject of yet another explosive lawsuit.On the two-year anniversary of the attack in Ukraine that claimed the lives of Fox News photojournalist Pierre Zakrzewski and contractor Oleksandra “Sasha” Kuvshynova, the network was accused Thursday of being culpable for the fatal incident by engaging in “reckless and negligent conduct” that put the crew in harm’s way. The network was also accused of launching “a campaign of material misrepresentations and omissions to hide its own accountability for the disaster and shift blame” to then-security contractor Shane Thomson, who allegedly warned against the crew entering the dangerous zone near Kyiv where they were killed.The lawsuit, filed by Kuvshynova’s parents and Thomson in New York State court, not only named Fox News as a defendant, but also Fox Corporation Chairman Emeritus Rupert Murdoch, Fox News Chief Executive Suzanne Scott, and correspondent Benjamin Hall, who was severely injured in the attack, but survived.Both deaths were announced at the time by Scott, who said the team’s vehicle came under fire as they were reporting. Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Ukrainian interior minister, blamed artillery shelling by Russian forces.But the circumstances that led to the 2022 tragedy, the lawsuit stated, were uncovered as part of a sweeping investigation conducted by lawyers for Thomson and Kuvshynova’s parents to get to the bottom of what happened on March 14, 2022.Their probe found that the circumstances that led to the attack were set into motion when the Fox News team disregarded warnings to avoid the Irpin-Hostomel area near Kyiv. The mayor of Irpin had barred journalists from the city and Thomson, the security contractor, had vetoed the idea of reporting from the area, according to the lawsuit. Disregarding such security warnings would be unusual in a war zone and Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst, who was also reporting from the area at the time, had indicated days prior to the incident that the network’s journalists were following protocol. Heading to the area was considered so dangerous, the lawsuit said, that the Ukrainian driver who had been working with the Fox News team “refused” to take them there, forcing the crew to “find a different driver.”Eventually, when the crew arrived in the region, they rendezvoused with a few Ukrainian soldiers, who had previously escorted The New York Times reporters into the area. That’s when they realized the vehicle the soldiers were driving was “not large enough to carry all” of them, the lawsuit said. The team decided to leave their security consultant behind, the lawsuit explained.“The absence of the security contractor was vital, as the crew made fatal mistakes,” the lawsuit said.The Fox News crew ultimately stopped at an abandoned checkpoint where they were attacked. According to the lawsuit, the “car caught fire and Sasha was burned to ashes inside it, causing her death.” Zakrzewski, the lawsuit said, “managed to escape the car but bled to death at the side of the road from a small puncture wound in his leg.” The lawsuit alleged that “the bleeding could easily have been stemmed to save his life if the security contractor trained in battlefield first aid had been present.” Hall survived the attack and was “later found grievously injured” before being taken for emergency medical care.In the aftermath of the tragedy, the lawsuit alleged that Fox News has tried to cover up its failures and hide them from the public.Fox News took “all electronic gear … that survived the attack” and “withheld any record of any evaluation or re-evaluation of the crew’s assignment,” the lawsuit said. The account of the attack that Hall later recounted in his book published by HarperCollins, the lawsuit added, was “misleading.” And, the lawsuit said, Fox News “has attempted to impose non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements on all the surviving family members.”The lawsuit also alleged that after the fatal incident, Fox News tasked Thomson with transporting Zakrzewski’s body across the Polish border to his widow. The lawsuit said that Thomson objected to the assignment, but was told he had to complete it, and was later “let go from his employment without explanation.”“He was severely traumatized by the combined experience of his colleagues being killed, transporting the dead body of his friend, and then being dismissed,” the lawsuit said. “Shane reached out to Fox repeatedly for assistance with the trauma. Fox never responded, even after Shane attempted suicide by hanging.”The lawsuit alleged that Thomson has had trouble finding work because he is “frequently associated with the Fox News disaster of being security advisor for the crew that was killed in Irpin the day after journalists were banned from the area.” The lawsuit also alleged that Fox News employees spread a bogus story that he had a “drinking problem in Kyiv at the time of the fatal incident, insinuating that this was the cause of the disastrous assignment in which Pierre and Sasha were killed.”Kuvshynova’s parents and Thomson are seeking unspecified punitive damages.“Sasha Kuvshynova’s final text message — responding to her parents, who were highly alarmed by the dangerousness of the situation unfolding on March 14, with Russian forces closing in on Kyiv — was not to worry,” the lawsuit said, “because Fox was a professional news organization that knew what it was doing and would not expose her to unnecessary danger.”"

        "title": "Biden says it’s ‘vital’ US Steel remain American owned and operated",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "President Joe Biden on Thursday said he believes it’s “vital” that US Steel remain American owned and operated, dealing a blow to the iconic company’s planned sale to Japan’s Nippon Steel.The announcement marks the strongest opposition yet from the White House to a controversial deal that has drawn some bipartisan criticism.“It is important that we maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers. I told our steel workers I have their backs, and I meant it,” Biden said in a statement. “US Steel has been an iconic American steel company for more than a century, and it is vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.”The Biden administration is concerned about some of Nippon’s assets in China, a person familiar with the administration’s thinking told CNN.US Steel was not immediately available to provide comment.In a statement, Nippon Steel said: “Our aim is to bolster and grow U. S. Steel in the U.S. market in a way that prioritizes its talented employees, and we have provided significant commitments to the USW in our continued efforts to reach a mutually agreeable resolution… Nippon Steel is the right partner to ensure that US Steel is successful for generations to come as an iconic American company.”Previously, the Biden administration voiced support for a thorough review of the $14.1 billion deal that was announced in December. Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council, issued a statement that month saying Biden believes the deal deserves “serious scrutiny” in terms of its impact on national security and supply chains.Shares of Pittsburgh-based US Steel plunged 13% on Wednesday — its worst day since 2020 — after the Washington Post and other outlets reported Biden planned to express veiled opposition to the sale ahead of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s arrival in Washington for a state visit on April 10.US Steel shares retreated another 3% on Thursday.It’s noteworthy that Biden is voicing his opposition to the deal before the national security review that is believed to be ongoing by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. That inter-agency panel is led by the Treasury secretary and is supposed to weigh deals without taking politics into account.The Treasury Department declined to comment.After the Biden statement, the US Chamber of Commerce warned against politicizing the US Steel deal and said the transaction should proceed if the CFIUS review reveals no national security concerns.“Attempts to politicize the objective” CFIUS review of the sale are “both inappropriate and counterproductive,” John Murphy, head of international at the US Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. “Japanese investment in the US supports nearly one million American jobs, and officials must be careful not to send a chilling signal to international companies that US politics may put their job-creating investments in the US at risk.”Michael Leiter, head of the CFIUS and national security practices at law firm Skadden, Arps told CNN that Biden’s commentary is “highly unusual, although not unprecedented given how increasingly politicized US investment issues have become.”“That the White House has repeatedly commented on this matter while not dictating the outcome certainly signals that the road isn’t getting smoother for CFIUS’ approval,” Leiter said, “and it signals to our allies like the Japanese that protectionism isn’t dead.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Uber will pay more than 8,000 taxi and hire car drivers in Australia almost 272 million Australian dollars ($179 million) in compensation for losses they suffered after the ride-sharing giant entered the country in 2012, lawyers representing the drivers said Monday.The settlement is the fifth-largest in Australia’s history, according to Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, the law firm that filed the class action suit in 2019. Uber confirmed in a statement that it had reached an agreement in principle but did not comment on the details of the proposed settlement.“This case succeeded where others have failed,” Maurice Blackburn said on its Facebook page. “We’re proud that thousands of people put their faith in us to deliver this outcome, and to hold Uber to account.”Uber has faced serial litigation around the world since its launch in 2009, including from passengers, governments and its own drivers. It has also made “significant contributions to various state-level taxi compensation schemes” in Australia since 2018, according to the company.The bitter feuds between Uber drivers and conventional taxi operators have subsided in recent years, as the company has steadily gained regulatory approval to operate in countries around the world. Uber now teams up with taxi drivers in many countries. In November, it announced a partnership with London’s iconic black cabs to give cab drivers access to Uber trip referrals.The lawsuit in Australia alleged that Uber had operated illegally in four of the country’s six states — Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia — using vehicles and drivers without the necessary licenses and accreditations.“This caused loss of income to authorized taxi drivers and operators, and hire car operators. It also resulted in a drop in the value of taxi licenses,” said Elizabeth O’Shea, principal lawyer for class actions at Maurice Blackburn, in a video posted to the firm’s website.“The law then changed in these states to make Uber’s business legal going forward,” she added.In a statement on its website, Uber Australia said ride-sharing regulations did not exist anywhere in the world when it launched more than a decade ago. “Today is different, and Uber is now regulated in every state and territory across Australia, and governments recognize us as an important part of the nation’s transport mix,” the company added.“With today’s proposed settlement, we put these legacy issues firmly in our past.”While this case may now be in the rearview mirror, Uber faces ongoing lawsuits in the United States and elsewhere over how it classifies its drivers. In its latest annual report, the company said its business would be “adversely affected” if drivers were reclassified as employees or workers, rather than independent contractors.In 2021, Uber was forced to reclassify tens of thousands of its drivers in the United Kingdom as “workers,” following a UK Supreme Court ruling. The change means drivers are entitled to a minimum wage, vacation time, and a pension.Last year, meanwhile, New York Attorney General Letitia James ordered Uber to pay $290 million into a settlement fund after it emerged that the company had withheld certain pay from drivers and prevented them from receiving some benefits available under New York labor laws. Rival Lyft was made to pay $38 million into a similar fund.Dhruv Tikekar contributed reporting."

        "title": "Sam Altman returns to OpenAI in a bizarre reversal of fortunes",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry.“We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo.“We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said.In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm’s “strong partnership” with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker’s biggest financial backer.The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving.The details of Altman’s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently “candid” with the board.That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman’s ouster was the presence of tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis.As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO.But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company’s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company’s board didn’t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO.It’s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman’s return. Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work … I’m glad to have been a part of the solution.”Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X.Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision.And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades.“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”Altman’s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out.Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he has pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly.“Is [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?” he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. “Or is it gonna be more like the atom bomb — huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?”But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit.Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI’s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft’s products.OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly been in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone.— CNN’s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting."

        "title": "Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is interested in buying TikTok",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday he’s assembling a team of investors to make a bid to buy TikTok.This comes a day after the House passed a measure to ban the Chinese-owned social media giant or force a sale to a US-operated owner.“It’s a great business and I’m going to put together a group to buy TikTok,” Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC Thursday morning. Even though TikTok is likely unprofitable, “it’s worth a lot of money,” he added.Mnuchin said he would give existing US investors the option to roll over their stakes in TikTok but stressed that no entity would have more than 10% control. But he declined to name any individuals on the team he’s putting together.“There’s no way that the Chinese would ever let a US company own something like this in China,” he said. From his time in the administration, he said he’s seen evidence that having TikTok on your phone gives it the ability to “collect an awful lot of data.”But ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, may never be allowed to be sold to any company outside of China because of measures the government began putting into place in 2020. The Chinese government deems TikTok a sensitive technology and officials have said they’d oppose any forced sale that would involve exporting it into the hands of a foreign owner.Mnuchin and TikTok didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.Dan Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, told CNN that ByteDance and China will “never” sell TikTok with the source code — the “special sauce” that makes the app so successful and valuable.“Without the source code, this would be like buying an F1 car without the engine. It would be illogical,” Ives said.Mnuchin, though, said he’s looking to find a solution where the Chinese government will allow TikTok to be sold without a technology transfer.Mnuchin, who now leads Liberty Strategic Capital, a private equity firm, was an early advocate for forcing a sale of TikTok to a US company. But he faced opposition from other members of former President Donald Trump’s cabinet when the sale was proposed in 2020. Trump supported a ban at the time. He’s since changed his stance, arguing that it would benefit Facebook.“Facebook has been very bad for our country,” he said in a separate interview on CNBC earlier in the week. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, didn’t immediately respond to CNN.“I believe he would support a sale,” Mnuchin said Thursday, referring to Trump. “I’ll call him up later and ask him.” He added that he’s been in touch with the former president in recent weeks regarding TikTok but has not discussed his nascent effort to acquire it.Thursday’s TikTok news comes just one week after Mnuchin led a $1 billion lifeline rescue of embattled regional lender New York Community Bank.The TikTok bill the House passed is now heading to the Senate, where it faces a much larger uphill battle in getting approved. President Joe Biden said he would sign the bill into law if the Senate passes it. Even if that happens, any kind of TikTok ban would likely be fought in courts. Already Montana was prevented from moving forward with a law to effectively ban the app after a federal judge blocked it last year.Ives, the tech analyst, said he sees a 25% chance that the TikTok legislation ultimately becomes law, forcing a sale of the company. He said countless parties are undoubtedly considering making an offer to buy TikTok should it go up for sale.“It’s sharks. They see blood in the water,” he said.However, the more likely buyer, according to Ives, would be a tech giant like Microsoft or Oracle, which already has a relationship with TikTok, and not a financial player like Mnuchin."

        "title": "Apple is getting serious about AI",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "​​ Apple appears to be finally raising the curtain on some of its AI efforts.Apple researchers say they’ve developed a family of multimodal models — which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time — called MM1. The report said its new methods boasts “superior abilities” and can offer advanced reasoning and in-context learning to respond to text and images.The announcement hints at how such a system could benefit future Apple products, including iPhones, Macs and its Siri voice assistant.It comes as Apple is expected to unveil several new AI features at its developer conference in June.At the same time, however, Apple has reportedly reached a deal with Google that indicates perhaps its own AI efforts are not quite where they want them to be yet. According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is interested in licensing and building Google’s Gemini AI engine, which includes chatbots and other AI tools, into upcoming iPhones and its iOS 18 features.As more tech companies pour billions of dollars into the development and rollout of artificial intelligence, Apple has largely been left out of the conversation, with many other tech companies already making big strides in the space. A partnership with Google would catapult Apple into the growing AI arms race.The report also said Apple previously held conversations with OpenAI, the company behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT.Apple, Google and OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.In February, CEO Tim Cook teased during an investors meeting that he sees “incredible breakthrough potential for generative AI, which is why we’re currently investing significantly in this area.” But the company has not yet shared much about its vision for AI.Behind the scenes, Apple reportedly has been working its on-device generative AI capabilities and acquiring companies, such as Canadian startup DarwinAI. It also has a Machine Learning Research division dedicated to advancing AI.Angelo Zino, a VP and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in an investors note on Monday that the latest news “likely confirms that Apple’s internal efforts are well behind those of OpenAI and Gemini.”But he added a potential deal “shows that the company is serious about adding significant AI capabilities across iOS 18 this fall when its new iPhones launch.”Google may be well suited for the new AI partnership considering its existing search partnership; the company has invested heavily on ensuring Google remains the default search engine option on Apple’s Safari browser. That search arrangement between the two tech giants, however, is under review by antitrust authorities.In another investor’s note on Monday, Wedbush Securities analysts said they see the potential partnership as a boon for both companies.“This is a major win for Google to get onto the Apple ecosystem and have access to the golden installed base of Cupertino with clearly a major license fee attached to this,” the analysts said.It would also give Apple the foundation and technology to double down on AI-powered iOS features currently being developed.The partnership could bring Gemini to nearly 2 billion Apple devices.Wedbush also said the deal would be a huge “validation moment” for Google’s generative AI positioning, considering Microsoft and OpenAI captured early market share by commercializing some of their products."

        "title": "More employers now say they’re willing to hire workers without a college degree. But is that playing out?",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "For decades, not having a college degree has often been a barrier for workers seeking a higher-level, better-paying job. But more employers are now saying they’re willing to hire them.College degrees were used by companies as a proxy for skills and competence when evaluating potential hires — making it very difficult for lower-wage, non-degreed workers even to be considered.A majority of US workers have had to contend with that barrier. Only 37.7% of Americans ages 25 and up had a bachelor’s degree in 2022, according to the US Census Bureau.But employers are now — at least publicly — becoming more open to the idea of skills-based hiring, which focuses on a job candidates’ competencies and capacity to learn new skills rather than on their educational background.Why the change of heart? There are several factors. But lurking over all of them is a demographic reality: The falling US birth rate will produce fewer workers in the years ahead to replace the number of workers retiring.Additionally, employers are increasingly aware that the skills needed to do many jobs don’t necessarily require a four-year degree, and that competent workers can be trained in needed skills as they arise.President Joe Biden, in his State of the Union speech Thursday night, acknowledged the need for skills-based hiring more than once, noting that “private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America — creating tens of thousands of jobs, many of them paying over $100,000 a year, and don’t require a college degree.” He also said he is “connecting businesses and high schools so students get hands-on experience and a path to a good-paying job, whether or not they go to college.”At a Fortune conference in October last year, Ken Frazier, the former CEO of Merck, noted that roughly three-quarters of Black adults do not have college degrees, yet the vast majority of openings at leading US companies required college degrees “for almost any job.”What’s more, since George Floyd’s murder in 2020, there has been a push to improve diversity and equity in company workforces. That means the lack of college degrees can’t be ignored, since Blacks and Hispanics are least likely to have a bachelor’s degree. In 2022, only 27.6% of Black adults and 20.9% of Hispanics had one, compared to nearly 41.8% of non-Hispanic White population, according to Census data.After Floyd’s murder, Frazier co-founded the group OneTen. Its goal is to help non-degreed Black workers find better jobs with family-sustaining pay, as defined by the MIT Living Wage Calculator. OneTen’s mission has since grown to include all workers without four-year degrees, and the group has pulled together a coalition of more than 70 leading US corporations from Accenture to Yum! Brands and talent development firms that support OneTen’s mission of closing the opportunity gap for those without degrees.So far, the group has played a matchmaking role for employers in the hiring and promotion of 108,000 non-degreed workers, said OneTen CEO Debbie Dyson at the same Fortune event. She also noted its career marketplace platform has 23,000 profiles of non-degreed job seekers and those seeking training, which is a talent pool that employers can search.OneTen’s hand in more than 100,000 job advancements is notable, but it is still well below the group’s goal of 1 million hires and promotions of non-degreed workers within 10 years.That may reflect what one recent study found: Not all employers who talk about skills-based hiring and remove degree requirements from job ads are actually hiring candidates without degrees.“[F]or all its fanfare, the increased opportunity promised by skills-based hiring has borne out in not even 1 in 700 hires last year,” wrote the authors of a report from Harvard Business School and the Burning Glass Institute.Directionally, however, the signs are encouraging. The report’s authors note that the 37% of companies in its sample that did follow through on their skills-based hiring commitment are already seeing benefits.“[D]espite the limited progress to date, our analysis shows that, for those who embrace it, skills-based hiring … yields tangible, measurable value. Skills-based hiring boosts retention among non-degreed workers hired into roles that formerly asked for degrees,” they said.Candidates hired into those roles received a 25% pay increase on average, the researchers added.“If the arc of corporate practice bends toward profitability, the win-win that skills-based hiring represents is an opportunity firms are remiss to ignore,” the authors wrote.In the meantime, the Federal Reserve banks of Philadelphia and Cleveland created an interactive tool called the Occupational Mobility Explorer that was released at the end of 2020.The tool is aimed at lower-wage workers without college degrees. It helps them identify better-paying occupations that have overlap with the skills required in their current positions.For example: A cashier in the Cincinnati metro area might consider a job first as a customer service representative, then move on to the role of police or fire station dispatcher and later transition to becoming a human resource specialist or legal assistant. The strong skills overlap between cashiers and customer service reps include customer service, communication skills and retail industry knowledge. From there, the skills commonly required of customer service reps and dispatchers include customer service, communication and problem solving. And so on. With each move, the former cashier’s pay could increase considerably. (The pay data in the tool still reflects 2020 pay levels, but it will be updated later this year, according to a spokesperson for the Philadelphia Fed.)The tool can be an eye-opener not just for job seekers but also employers when it comes to seeing what skills non-degreed workers from various occupations bring to the table.“It’s a good illustration of how skills gained in prior jobs can be used to move up the career ladder,” said Keith Wardrip, senior community development research adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia."

        "title": "Searches for VPNs spike in Texas after Pornhub pulls out of the state",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Searches for virtual private networking (VPN) software briefly spiked in Texas this week after Pornhub suspended service in the state over a law forcing adult websites to verify the age or identities of their users.The four-fold rise in Google searches for tools that can circumvent the state-level blocking suggests the law may already be having unintended side effects, days after a federal appeals court upheld the legislation and said it could remain in effect.Visitors with Texas IP addresses who visit Pornhub’s website are now presented with a full-page message calling the Texas law “ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous.”“Until the real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in Texas,” the message reads. “In doing so, we are complying with the law, as we always do, but hope that governments around the world will implement laws that actually protect the safety and security of users.”Search interest in VPNs began disproportionately rising in Texas Thursday compared to the rest of the country, according to a CNN analysis of Google Trends data — quadrupling in the hours following Pornhub’s announcement before retreating slightly by early Friday morning.While Google Trends merely shows correlations between events and is only useful as a gauge of relative search interest for a given snapshot of time, the immediacy of the search spike, coupled with its concentration from within Texas, highlights the potential connection between the law and Pornhub’s users.A link “seems pretty likely,” said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights advocacy group.“The apparent spike in VPN searches in Texas shows that these types of age verification laws aren’t just unconstitutional, they’re also silly and ineffective,” Greer said. “Just like millions of people in countries like China, Russia and Turkey evade their government’s draconian online censorship regimes using simple tools like VPNs, now we see Texans doing the same to get around their own state government’s invasive rules.”The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), another digital rights group, said Texas is not the only state to see such searches rise in response to age verification laws.“Similar search spikes have been reported after other states passed age verification laws, which EFF opposes,” said Hudson Hongo, a spokesperson for the group. “No one should have to hand over their driver’s license just to access free websites.”Pornhub has pulled out of multiple states in response to a wave of age verification laws sweeping the country, including in Montana, Utah, Virginia and others. It also highlights the running debate in statehouses nationwide about how and whether governments can require websites to perform age verification.The law in question in Texas is known as HB 1181. It requires adult websites to implement “reasonable age verification” methods to ensure that pornography is not being distributed to minors. Those methods include either requiring users to submit “proof of identity” such as a government-issued ID to the adult website or to a third-party contractor, or by submitting other personal data to a third-party contractor, such as biometric information, that enables the vendor to check a user’s age.Last summer, a US district judge temporarily blocked the law, finding that it was overly broad, likely violated the First Amendment and threatened marginalized communities.“It runs the risk that the state can monitor when an adult views sexually explicit materials and what kind of websites they visit,” wrote Judge David Alan Ezra in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas. “Given Texas’s ongoing criminalization of homosexual intercourse, it is apparent that people who wish to view homosexual material will be profoundly chilled from doing so if they must first affirmatively identify themselves to the state.”Later, however, in response to an emergency appeal by Texas officials, the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals overruled Ezra with an order that allowed the law to take effect.And last week, a three-judge panel of the same appeals court found that Ezra applied too tough a standard in reviewing the law.The 5th Circuit court’s latest decision formally lifts the injunction against the Texas law.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton posted on X Thursday celebrating Pornhub’s decision to withdraw from the state.“Sites like PornHub are on the run,” he wrote, adding: “In Texas, companies cannot get away with showing porn to children. If they don’t want to comply, good riddance.”Pornhub said in a blog post that it supports age verification but that forcing individual websites and third-party providers to handle users’ most sensitive personal information creates unreasonable privacy and security risks. Pornhub has proposed, and reiterated on Thursday, that age verification checks should be performed exclusively on a user’s device, without requiring them to send data over the internet to third parties."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "The health insurance billing system in the United States is stabilizing following an unprecedented cyberattack on a key company last month, but smaller health clinics may still need help to ensure they can stay in business, senior Biden administration officials said Monday after meeting with health care executives.Ninety-five percent of Change Healthcare’s health insurance claims are now being processed, the insurance billing firm that has been roiled by the Feb. 21 hack, a senior administration official told reporters in an update on the federal response to the hack.“[O]ur real focus is making sure we don’t get to the point where there are issues with access to care,” the official said in a press call conducted on background, meaning reporters cannot cite officials by name. “And the way to do that is make sure you keep liquidity in the system.”“We are still hearing from small rural safety net providers who need cash assistance,” another senior official said.The cyberattack forced Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealthGroup, to take computer systems that handle electronic payments and insurance claims offline in what the American Hospital Association (AHA) has called the most significant cyberattack in US health care history. Change Healthcare says it handles one in every three patient records in the US.Change Healthcare restored its electronic payments platform on March 15 and “is proceeding with payer implementations,” UnitedHealthGroup said in a statement on Monday. The statement indicated 99% of the company’s pharmacy network services are back online and the company is working on the rest.Change Healthcare will release “medical claims preparation software” to thousands of customers over the next several days, the parent firm said, touting an “important step in the resumption of services.”But the full financial impact of the hack is still unknown. US officials told reporters they don’t have that data.“Billions of dollars” stopped flowing to health care providers because of the hack, according to AHA, which represents thousands of hospitals across the country.The fallout has been acute for people trying to get their prescriptions and for doctors trying to run their health practices. CNN interviewed a woman in Colorado who paid $1,600 out of pocket, at least temporarily, for Paxlovid because her insurance couldn’t be billed, and the chief financial officer of a cancer-treatment clinic in Oregon who worried she would be forced to close her doors.In meetings over the last week, senior White House and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials have urged UnitedHealthGroup executives and those from other health care firms to be clear about what forms of financing are available to health providers during the disruption.The unprecedented pressure on a hacked US health care firm won’t go away with the restoration of billing services. HHS has opened an investigation into whether Change Healthcare has complied with federal law to protect patient data."

        "title": "Emergency expenses will happen. Try these strategies if you don’t have the cash on hand",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Whether it’s an unexpected car repair or an emergency room visit, life happens. And it’s expensive. For those without any kind of safety net, paying for unanticipated expenses can mean borrowing money at astronomical interest rates, as well as forking over late fees if you can’t make payments on time.And while surveys indicate that there are plenty of people in just such a situation, there are some inexpensive and safe ways to access emergency funds.In a May 2023 report on the economic well-being of US households, the Federal Reserve reported that only 63% of Americans said they would pay an unexpected $400 expense with their own cash or cash equivalent (e.g. putting it on a credit card but paying that bill in full when it comes due). Of the remaining 37%, most indicated they would borrow the money (using everything from credit cards to payday loans to friends or family). Some said they would sell something to foot the bill. And 13% indicated they simply would not be able to pay it.Another survey, released by Bankrate.com in January, found that only 44% of US adults said they could pay a $1,000 emergency expense from their savings, while 35% indicated they would have to borrow the money. In that latter group, 21% said they would finance it with a credit card; 10% would borrow the money from family or friends, and 4% say they would take out a personal loan. Another 16% say they would have to reduce their spending on other things.An earlier survey by Bankrate, meanwhile, found that two-thirds of US adults worried they don’t have enough emergency savings to cover them if they lost their primary source of income. Typically, that would mean at least three months’ worth of living expenses.Credit card interest rates remain sky-high — the average at the end of February was 20.75%, according to Bankrate.com, with average penalty rates pushing 30%. So simply charging an emergency expense to a high-rate card should be your last resort.You might, however, look for a new credit card with a 0% introductory rate that will be in effect for a year or more, said Noah Damsky, founder of Marina Wealth Advisors. “This will provide you with the short-term cash you need, and provide you potentially with 18 months to pay it back, without interest.”Just be sure to pay it all back before the 0% introductory period ends, otherwise a high rate will kick in for the remaining balance.If your emergency is medical or dental in nature, ask the health provider if they offer a payment plan. “Many providers offer plans without interest, allowing you to spread the cost over several months,” said Marcel Miu, lead wealth planner at Simplify Wealth Planning.For some people, another low-cost option might be to borrow from a close relative or friend, but only if doing so would not jeopardize your relationship — which is a very personal decision. “While this option requires careful consideration and clear communication about repayment terms, it can be a way to cover expenses without the formalities and costs associated with traditional loans,” Miu said.In recent years, alternative ways to access cash have also been created outside of the traditional financial system, which has proven expensive for many families.Daisy Martini, a 29-year-old working for New York City’s Department of Education, felt she didn’t have many good options after she’d been temporarily laid off during the pandemic. Her bills were piling up and she had already accrued high credit card balances from her years in school.So to get small, short-term loans to tide her over, she turned to SoLo Funds, a community financing platform that puts borrowers in the driver seat: They decide how much they need to borrow, when they can pay it back and how much they’re willing to pay a lender as a “tip” for providing the loan. That tip can never exceed 15% of the loan. Borrowers may offer a much smaller tip, or even nothing. It’s up to lenders to decide if they will accept the borrowers’ terms. Loan amounts can’t exceed $575 and the average is $248, according to SoLo cofounder Rodney Williams. Once borrowers repay in full, they can then borrow again.Besides using SoLo for small emergency expenses, such as fixing a leak in the roof, Martini said she sometimes uses it for expenses she has a week ahead of when she knows she will be paid. She likes the platform better than the more anonymous interactions with a credit card company. Knowing who is lending to her gives her even more incentive to pay what she owes on time.“I knew if I borrowed from someone in the community who cared, I would … pay them back. You’re paying someone back who empathizes with your story,” she said.While getting a low-cost loan to tide you over in a pinch may be a relief, not having to borrow at all is optimal.To make the next emergency expense less stressful and costly, you can build emergency savings with small amounts consistently over time.Damsky recommends setting up automatic daily transfers from your checking account to a savings account. For example, he said, if you want to save roughly $150 a month, you could set up a transfer of just $5 a day or $35 a week. At the end of a year, you will have built up more than $1,800, plus whatever interest you earn on those savings. To maximize that interest, try to transfer your money into a high-yielding online savings account, which currently pay between 4% and 5%, according to Bankrate.com.The same pattern applies if your goal is to have at least three months of living expenses to protect you in case you lose your job. “Even small amounts, if consistent, can accumulate over time,” Miu said.He also recommends redirecting at least a portion of one-time annual windfalls — such as a tax refund or bonus — to a high-yield savings account.Two other proven ways to bolster emergency savings are increasing your income (e.g., taking on a side gig,) or cutting back on spending that you do not consider essential to your life, said Linda Grizely, a fee-only planner at Visions Financial Planning. But, she cautioned, ”It’s important to strike a balance and avoid excessive cuts. A plan that can be adhered to is the key to success.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Elon Musk said he is “almost always” sober during his late-night — or, in some cases, very early morning — posting sessions on his social media platform, X.The billionaire Tesla CEO’s comment was made in an interview with journalist Don Lemon, during which Musk discussed his use of the medication ketamine. Musk, who is known for his often erratic behavior, has faced scrutiny following recent reports about his alleged drug use and the potential impact on his companies.“There are times when I have sort of a … negative chemical state in my brain, like depression I guess, or depression that’s not linked to any negative news, and ketamine is helpful for getting one out of the negative frame of mind,” Musk told Lemon. Musk added that he has a prescription for the drug from “an actual, real doctor” and uses “a small amount once every other week or something like that.”While Musk said he doesn’t drink and doesn’t “know how to smoke pot,” he didn’t specify whether he was talking about ketamine or another substance when he said he is “almost always” sober while posting late at night.Musk has previously posted on X about his prescription use of ketamine, a drug used primarily in hospitals as an anesthetic but which is increasingly being explored as a potential treatment for depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions. Musk’s comments offer greater insight into the use of the drug by one of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful people.Musk denied that he overuses the medication, saying, “if you use too much ketamine, you can’t really get work done. I have a lot of work, I’m typically putting in 16-hour days … so I don’t really have a situation where I can be not mentally acute for an extended period of time.”Musk said he believes his depression is genetic and added that he doesn’t believe his ketamine use will impact his companies or their government contracts.“From a standpoint of Wall Street, what matters is execution,” he said. “Are you building value for investors? Tesla is worth about as much as the rest of the car industry combined … so from an investor standpoint, if there is something I’m taking, I should keep taking it.”The wide-ranging, 90-minute interview between Musk and Lemon — which kicked off a feud between the two men and resulted in the end of a planned deal for X to pay Lemon to post his new streaming show on the platform — covered far more than Musk’s ketamine use, including Musk’s criticisms of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and demand for Tesla’s Cybertruck.Musk also discussed the state of the core advertising business on X, which has suffered since the billionaire acquired the company formerly known as Twitter because of a rise in hateful and controversial content on the platform. Musk previously said advertisers who left X over concerns about antisemitic content could “go f**k yourself” and accused them of killing the company.In the interview with Lemon, Musk said that almost all of the company’s advertisers have returned, and “it’s a very short list of advertisers who are not coming back to the platform, and our advertising revenue is rising rapidly and our subscription revenue is rising rapidly and I feel very optimistic about the future of the X platform.” Still, the billionaire appeared uninterested in adjusting X’s policies to appease advertisers who have left the site.“You can choose where you want your advertising, what you want your advertiser to appear next to, but you can’t insist on censorship of the entire platform,” he said. “If you insist on censorship of the entire platform, even where your advertising doesn’t appear, then obviously we will not want them as an advertiser.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "The US government is cracking down on cable TV “junk fees,” forcing providers to publish a single, comprehensive price — so consumers know up front exactly how much they’ll pay for services inclusive of all extra costs.The junk fees crackdown is part of a series of moves the Federal Communications Commission announced Thursday. During its monthly open meeting, the agency addressed other consumer issues, including finalizing a new cybersecurity product label for hack-resistant tech gadgets and releasing a report finding that 24 million Americans still lack high speed internet access.The new junk fees rule requires cable and satellite TV companies to list “all-in” prices to consumers in their billing and marketing materials — including any miscellaneous fees, such as those related to sports programming or local broadcast channels.Between 24% and 33% of the typical consumer’s bill can be attributed to fees, consumer advocates told the FCC.The new rule aims to help consumers comparison shop among different providers. The move could simplify what is currently a difficult process of comparing apples to oranges, the FCC said.“No one likes surprises on their bill,” said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. “The advertised price for service should be the price you pay when your bill arrives. It shouldn’t include a bunch of unexpected junk fees that are separate from the top line price you were told when you signed up.”In a report released Thursday alongside the agency’s 3-2 vote, the FCC cited a filing that Consumer Reports submitted to the agency, alleging that cable companies publicly advertise “relatively low base rates” to lure customers in before imposing “a dizzying array of other charges.”The cable industry has pushed back, saying “all-in” pricing is unnecessary and that the current practice of breaking out fees into separate line items is a more transparent approach that helps consumers.“Our members clearly disclose the specific amounts of the fees that will apply and the total amount customers will pay for service, thereby ensuring that customers are not ‘surprised by unexpected fees,’” said NCTA, a trade association representing some of the nation’s largest cable companies, in a filing to the FCC.In a separate move last year, the FCC proposed banning certain cable fees altogether, including early termination fees that the agency says hinder competition and prevent customers from easily switching providers. That proposal would also require companies to provide consumer refunds if a subscriber cancels their plan mid-month.In addition to cable, the FCC also addressed internet availability during its Thursday meeting. Tens of millions of Americans still don’t have access to high-speed home internet, the FCC added Thursday in a new report highlighting the digital divide.The problem affects more than 1 in 4 Americans, or 28%, who live in rural areas, the FCC said, and the same is true for 23% of people living on tribal lands. Overall, 7% of the country, or 24 million Americans, lack high-speed access.“It was four years ago this week that so many of us were told to go home,” said Rosenworcel, referring to the Covid-19 lockdowns of 2020. “The pandemic exposed our digital divide in living color.”The new report is based on 2022 data and first-time insights from a massive, years-long revamp of FCC coverage maps — which officials say provide radically more accurate service estimates. Previously, entire census blocks were considered served by broadband if just one household within a census block had high-speed internet, dramatically overstating the number of connected Americans.The report also reflects newly adopted revisions in how the country defines high-speed internet, which the FCC voted to approve on Thursday.The definition of high-speed home internet has not been updated since 2015, when the FCC set the threshold at a minimum download speed of 25 megabits per second and a minimum upload speed of 3 megabits per second.Thursday’s revisions set the new standard at 100 Mbps for downloads and 20 Mbps for uploads, reflecting advances in technology and how faster internet speeds have become an absolute necessity for everyday life, supporting everything from telehealth visits to remote work.The definition of broadband is more than academic; it has far-reaching implications for how the country allocates billions in federal funding for infrastructure and government aid programs.The FCC moves follow Congress’ decision to spend billions of dollars in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law to build out internet service to hard-to-reach and underserved areas. It also comes as more than 23 million low-income households are at risk of losing their internet service, or could face potential bill shock, due to the expiration this spring of a critical benefit program popular with both parties known as the Affordable Connectivity Program.Thursday’s FCC report sets a long-term goal to serve Americans everywhere with download speeds of at least 1,000 Mbps, also known as gigabit speeds, and download speeds of 500 Mbps or more.Republican members of the FCC criticized the report on connectivity and the vote to increase the definition of broadband, saying the moves appear intended to justify more regulation of internet service providers and taxpayer spending.A Biden administration plan to protect consumer electronics from hackers also received final approval on Thursday as the FCC voted unanimously to greenlight a product label that will soon appear on smart home devices, baby monitors and other common gadgets.The label, which resembles a shield and that officials compare to the Energy Star certification program that denotes energy-efficient products, is intended to help buyers pick out connected appliances that voluntarily meet rigorous cybersecurity standards.A wide range of products will be eligible for the label, including internet-connected refrigerators, washing machines, doorbell cameras and smart speakers — provided that they meet criteria published by the National Institute for Standards and Technology.Some of the participating electronics makers and retailers in the program include giants such as Logitech, LG, Samsung, Best Buy and Amazon.“You want to know that when you bring that monitor into your house to watch your newborn, that connection is secure and is not going to invite any malware or malicious activity into your home,” said Rosenworcel, the chairwoman. “I think parents everywhere feel that way.”US officials have said that consumers have their own role to play in protecting the nation from cyberattacks — and that is by making informed decisions about what tech products to buy.“Imagine you’re a mom, and you’re worried about someone taking pictures of your infant lying in a crib and posting them on the dark web,” US deputy national security advisor Anne Neuberger said during an onstage appearance this year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “Think about your home alarm system, somebody hacking into it and unlocking digital locks. Those are examples we see today.”The “US Cyber Trust Mark” label will improve the country’s baseline cybersecurity by ensuring that the most widely used tech products in America are those that have been specifically hardened against hacking, the Biden administration has said. It could also encourage competition among electronics manufacturers to offer the most secure devices on the market.Thursday’s action by the FCC establishes the Cyber Trust Mark program, plus a publicly available database that will list all the trusted products that have received the label.Neuberger has said the Biden administration is working with overseas counterparts to extend the labeling program to the European Union, and that the partnership will make US products more attractive and competitive in the EU. She has also said consumers could begin seeing the label on store shelves by the end of the year."

        "title": "United CEO tries to reassure customers following multiple safety incidents",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "United Airlines is trying to reassure passengers after a series of incidents on its Boeing jets this year, sending out a statement to customers that safety is “at the center of everything that we do.”“While they are all unrelated, I want you to know that these incidents have our attention and have sharpened our focus,” United CEO Scott Kirby said in a Monday morning message to customers.On Friday in a United Boeing 737-800 landed in Medford, Oregon, with a panel from the underside of the fuselage missing.Earlier this month, United suffered a series of four incidents, all involving Boeing jets . A United Boeing 737-900ER spewed flames from an engine after takeoff from Houston, a United Boeing 777 lost a wheel during takeoff from San Francisco, a United Boeing 737 Max slid off a runway in Houston, and a United Boeing 777 trailed hydraulic fluid leaving Sydney.“Our team is reviewing the details of each case to understand what happened and using those insights to inform our safety training and procedures across all employee groups,” Kirby said.United is adding an extra day to pilot training, retooling training for new mechanics, and “dedicating more resources to supplier network management.”Passengers seeing a series of bad headlines about the airline and its Boeing jets may consider booking away from the airline, in its letter, is trying to prevent customers from leaving. As of the end of last year, 81% of the jets that United uses on its mainline operations came from Boeing, compared to just over half the jets in the mainline fleets of rivals Delta and American airlines.Beyond the problems on United flights, the most dramatic Boeing incident this year involved an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 that lost a door plug in a January 5 flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. And last week a Latam Airlines flight from Sydney, Australia to Auckland, New Zealand plunged suddenly, causing some passengers to be thrown to the ceiling of the cabin.Investigators are still looking at the causes of both those incidents, but a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board found Boeing left the bolts off the 10-week-old Alaska Air jet needed to keep the door plug in place. And Boeing suggested the Latam incident may have been caused by an incident in the cockpit and not anything to do with the plane’s controls.The age of the aircraft in the United incidents suggest that the cause could lie with United personnel, rather than Boeing’s well documented quality issues. The plane that lost the panel on Friday’s flight was purchased by Boeing in 1998, for example. So Boeing’s quality issues almost certainly have nothing to do with that incident.Still, United’s operations have been disrupted by Boeing’s problems. It has frozen hiring for a new class of pilots, because it won’t be getting as many new planes from Boeing this year as originally promised after production was slowed by the FAA. And its fleet of 737 Max 9 jets were grounded for three weeks in January following the incident at Alaska Air.In addition, certification of a new model of Boeing jet that United has ordered, the 737 Max 10, has also been put on hold but the quality and safety problems at the company.Kirby told investors last week that United is looking at possibly buying more jets from Boeing competitor Airbus, and he said earlier this year that the Alaska Air incident was the “straw that broke the camel’s back” on its plans to get deliveries of the Max 10 any time in the foreseeable future.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified from where the flight with the engine fire took off. It departed from Houston."

        "title": "Why lab-grown diamond sales are surging",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "It’s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales.Not that you’d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag.“The result is really stunning,” said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst.He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period.Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.“The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,” he said. Too late. “It’s actually happening.”Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.“This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.“A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.”This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds.The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world’s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output.Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious.Mined diamonds have a controversial history that’s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded “conflict diamonds” that fund conflict in war-torn areas.Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot.Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small.Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world’s largest jewelry company, Pandora (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.Pandora said it’s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it.Signet, (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts.Calling it a “fast-growing category” in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don’t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it.“As the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn’t surprising,” said Don O’Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. “[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they’re conflict-free. They’re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.”Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting.There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won’t get much for it.But the value of a ring isn’t just monetary.“As a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,” said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. “I always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "London — An Australian computer scientist who claims he invented bitcoin is not “Satoshi Nakamoto,” the pseudonymous inventor of the cryptocurrency, a judge at London’s High Court ruled on Thursday.Craig Wright has long claimed to have been the author of a 2008 white paper, the foundational text of bitcoin, published under the pseudonym.The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) took Wright to court to stop him suing bitcoin developers, asking for a ruling that Wright was not Satoshi.Judge James Mellor said at the end of closing arguments on Thursday that the evidence Wright was not Satoshi was “overwhelming.”“Dr Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin white paper,” Mellor said. “Dr Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011.”COPA, whose members include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s payments firm Block (SQ), said the ruling was “a win for developers, for the entire open source community and for the truth.”“For over eight years, Dr Wright and his financial backers have lied about his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto and used that lie to bully and intimidate developers in the bitcoin community,” a COPA spokesperson said in a statement.“That ends today with the court’s ruling that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.”A spokesperson for Wright said he was “not prepared to speak to anyone at this time.”COPA had accused Wright of repeatedly forging documents to substantiate his claim, including during the trial itself, which Wright denied when he gave evidence.Its lawyer, Jonathan Hough, said at the start of the trial in February that Wright’s claim was “a brazen lie, an elaborate false narrative supported by forgery on an industrial scale.”Hough said that “there are elements of Dr Wright’s conduct that stray into farce,” citing his alleged use of ChatGPT to produce forgeries.But he added: “Dr Wright’s conduct is also deadly serious. On the basis of his dishonest claim to be Satoshi, he has pursued claims he puts at hundreds of billions of dollars, including against numerous private individuals.”Wright’s lawyers, however, argued in court filings that he had produced “clear evidence demonstrating his authorship of the white paper and creation of bitcoin.”In their closing arguments, COPA’s lawyers asked Mellor to refer the case to Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service “for consideration of prosecution for the offenses of perjury and perverting the course of justice.”Mellor did not indicate whether or not he would do so."

        "title": "Hertz CEO out following electric car ‘horror show’",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Trouble and turmoil continue at rental car company Hertz.The company, which announced in January it was selling 20,000 of the electric vehicles in its fleet, or about a third of the EVs it owned, is now replacing the CEO who helped build up that fleet, giving it the company’s fifth boss in just four years.The company announced that Stephen Scherr, who came to the company two years ago after nearly 30 years at Goldman Sachs, is stepping down at the end of this month. He’ll be replaced by Gil West, former chief operating officer of Delta Air Lines and General Motors’ Cruise unit.In the most recent quarter, Hertz took a $245 million hit to its earnings due to a drop in value of the EVs it was selling.While the number of EVs bought by American customers surged 40% last year to top 1 million for the first time, there was less demand than some of the traditional automakers had expected as they moved to offer EVs. Tesla, the leader in US EV sales, started a price war for EVs just over a year ago, driving down the value of both new and used EVs, such as those in Hertz’ fleet. And the drop in prices hit Hertz bottom line since it reduced the money it could expect to get from reselling the vehicles.But the problem for Hertz wasn’t necessarily that the cars were electric, and customers simply do not want to drive electric cars. The problem was how Hertz handled the fleet in general, according to industry analysts.“The execution and marketing of EV’s [by Hertz] was a horror show across the board,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who follows the EV market. “It’s a black eye they couldn’t recover from.”Part of the problem for Hertz was that even people who might want to buy an EV wouldn’t necessarily want to rent one while on the road, when they don’t necessarily have the ability to plug them in to charge them as they would at a private home. There might not be a charging station, or enough time, for a rental car customer to charge an EV, Ives said.By hewing to charging rules the way Hertz has enforced refueling rules, it may have dissuaded customers from wanting to rent an electric car. Without building any charging infrastructure at its rental locations, Hertz may have hurt its own business.“They don’t want to go 20 minutes out of their way at five in the morning to find a charging station,” Ives said.Hertz had announced it would buy 100,000 EVs from Tesla in October of 2021, just before it had its initial public offering following its emergence from bankruptcy. The hope was the promise of being on the cutting edge of growing demand for EVs would attract investors and lift its stock price.It subsequently announced plans to buy up to 175,000 EVs from General Motors and 65,000 EVs from Polestar, the EV company co-owned by Volvo and its Chinese parent company Geely. But Hertz’s total EV fleet only reached 60,000 before it decided to pull back. Still, that was enough to amount to 11% of its fleet.Even without the drop in value of the cars it bought, Hertz struggled with collision and damage repairs on an EV running about twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine vehicle, Scherr told investors on a 2023 call.But even without the $245 million hit to its bottom line from the problems with its EVs, Hertz would have lost money in the fourth quarter and the full year. That compares to profits at rival Avis Budget Group, which reported record revenue and the second-best adjusted operating profit in its history.And the EVs were not the only black eye for Hertz. In December 2022, the company agreed to pay $168 million to settle 364 claims related to the company falsely reporting rental cars as stolen. These cases sometimes resulted in Hertz customers being arrested and even imprisoned. While Hertz said a “meaningful portion” of that expense would be covered by insurance, it was another blow to its reputation.Scherr wasn’t the one who decided to make the big bet on EV demand by rental car customers. That was his predecessor, Mark Fields, a former CEO of Ford who was named interim CEO in October 2021, just weeks before Hertz announced plans to buy 100,000 Teslas, the largest order ever for Tesla from a single buyer.Fields’ predecessor as CEO, Paul Stone, stayed on as president and chief operating officer of Hertz, posts he held until resigning this past September. Stone had taken over just days before Hertz filed for bankruptcy in May of 2020. While the entire rental car industry was battered by the pandemic and the plunge in demand for travel and rental cars, rivals Avis Budget and privately-held Enterprise were able to ride out the storm without filing for bankruptcy.Where Hertz, which has been renting cars since the days of the Model T, was once the world’s largest rental car company, in 2023 its revenue was 22% less than its publicly held rival Avis Budget."

        "title": "A significant number of US 12th-graders report using delta-8 products, study says, and it may be a public health concern",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "High school seniors’ use of delta-8, a cannabis compound that’s sometimes marketed as “light THC” or a legal alternative to weed, is “appreciable,” according to a new study, particularly in states that don’t have a legal weed option for adults.Delta-8 THC, or delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol, is one of more than 100 chemical compounds found in the cannabis sativa plant. It’s an isomer or chemical cousin of sorts to delta-9 THC, the molecule that creates a high when someone ingests cannabis. Delta-9 is the most abundant form of THC in weed and is responsible for most of the psychoactive effects. Delta-8 acts on the brain the same way but is less potent and has fewer legal restrictions.Unlike with weed, there are no age restrictions for buying delta-8 in most states where the product is legal. Based on findings in the study, published Tuesday in the journal JAMA, the authors argue that the number of teens who have reported using delta-8 may be a “potential public health concern.”“What we hadn’t known prior to this study was to what extent are these products reaching teens, which was a concern because they weren’t being comprehensively regulated,” said study author Dr. Adam Leventhal, executive director of the USC Institute for Addiction Science.Delta-8 comes in many forms that may appeal to kids, like gummies, chocolate, cookies, vaping cartridges, sodas and even breakfast cereals. Delta-8 is also easily accessible since it is sold in convenience stores, gas stations and online, rather than only at age-restricted dispensaries.For the new study, the researchers used data from the Monitoring the Future in-school survey conducted across the US between February and June 2023. The survey is an ongoing nationally representative assessment of adolescents’ behavior and attitudes about a variety of topics. Researchers first measured delta-8 use in 2023.In the sample of 2,186 12th-grade students, 11.4% said they had used delta-8 THC in the past year, and even though weed is illegal for teens, 30.4% of the participants reported using it.Of the 295 students who reported that had they used delta-8 in the previous year, 68.1% used it at least three times, 35.4% had used it at least 10 times, and nearly 17% used it at least 40 times. Close to 91% of the delta-8 users also reported using weed.Delta-8 use was higher among teens in the South and the Midwest and in states where marijuana is not legal for adults, the study found.White teens were more likely to use delta-8 and weed than those of any other race or ethnicity. Slightly more boys used weed and delta-8 than girls, according to the study.“Eleven percent is a lot of people. That’s at least one or two students in every average-sized high school class who may be using delta-8. We don’t know enough about these drugs, but we see that they are already extremely accessible to teens, “ Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, who was not involved in study, said in a statement. “Cannabis use in general has been associated with negative impacts on the adolescent brain, so we must pay attention to the kinds of cannabis products teens are using, educate young people about potential risks, and ensure that treatment for cannabis use disorder and adequate mental health care is provided to those who need it.”Leventhal also said that 11% is a “very high” number.“We weren’t expecting it to be that high, and it was concerning when we saw the data,” he said.The study does have some limitations. The survey does not include teens in every state, and it surveys only those who are enrolled in school. Most of the participants were about 17 years old, so the study may not fully represent how many younger teens are using delta-8.The authors say their research probably underestimates how many kids are using these drugs. There has been a general concern that the number of students using delta-8 has been growing, according to an editorial published Tuesday alongside this study.“The unregulated proliferation of Δ8-THC represents a potential threat to the public’s health,” wrote Drs. Jennifer Whitehill, Kelly Dunn and Renee Johnson, who are scientists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Johns Hopkins University. “The trends in use patterns for Δ8-THC articulated by Harlow et al should serve as an important sentinel and mobilizing event; the next cannabinoid on the marketplace may not be so mild.”Delta-8 use has been enough of a concern among some public health officials and politicians that it is banned in at least 17 states and “severely restricted” in seven more as of November, according to the National Cannabis Industry Association.Scientists don’t fully understand what effects delta-8 may have on teens. There are no large medical studies to show exactly how it affects the body, particularly a young one that is still developing. Research on weed has found that it can negatively impact teens’ memory and attention as well as their ability to learn.“Some of the concerns based on the underlying biology would be, of course, addiction, like what we see with marijuana, some of the neurodevelopmental changes that can happen because the adolescent brain is still forming and exposure to intoxicating substances can interfere with proper development of the brain pathways that support cognition and emotion regulation,” Leventhal said.The FDA regulates drug products with cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds like it does with other pharmaceutical and medical products, but it does not regulate delta-8, so it is also not completely clear what is in each individual product.There are other indications that delta-8 use has been growing and causing some problems. Calls to America’s Poison Centers about delta-8 products spiked 82% from 2021 to 2022, the group said in a recent report, with 3,358 exposures managed in 2022. The calls fall into two categories: kids who have accidentally ingested the products and adults who had bad reactions."

        "category": "health",
        "text": "Need a good cry? Time to chop an onion.Onions are flavorful and an essential part of so many dishes, but that sting in your eyes may make them not feel worth it.Everyone claims to have the best trick to cut back on tears when cutting onions, but CNN talked to experts to see which ones are worth their salt.That stinging feeling in your eyes serves a purpose for onions, said Dr. Abbey Thiel, a food scientist and host of the YouTube channel Abbey the Food Scientist.“It’s really the plant’s defense mechanism to prevent it from being eaten,” Thiel said. Many plants have ways to avoid becoming lunch, such as thorns, spines or a bitter taste, she added.An onion’s defenses come from its cell structure, which has different ﻿compartments to separate substances that could have a reaction, she said.When you damage those cells — such as with a knife — an enzyme and an amino acid are combined to form sulfur compounds and another enzyme that sends vapor into the air and eventually to your eyes, said Dr. Bryan Quoc Le, faculty research fellow at Pacific Lutheran University in Parkland, Washington.“After reacting with the moisture in our eyes, small amounts of sulfuric acid are produced which irritates the cornea and leads to the tears,” Thiel said via email.A great method for producing﻿ less tears when chopping onions is placing a fan near you to blow the air near the vegetable away, Thiel said.“This way the wind carries away the molecules that usually enter your eye and lead to the tears,” she said.Yes, they look dorky, but goggles are a foolproof method, Thiel said. They protect your eyes from the molecules in the air, she said.“I’ve noticed that wearing contacts (instead of glasses) makes a big difference when I’m cutting an onion,” Thiel said. “You just want to have some type of shield protecting your eyes.”The fridge, freezer or a bowl of icy water can also help, Le said.Freezing, like microwaving, can change the texture of the onion, so only use that method when you are making something such as a soup, he said.And storing onions in the refrigerator can dampen their﻿ flavor, Le said. Instead, keep your onions in a cool, dry place and pop them in the refrigerator or in cold water about 20 minutes before it’s time to chop, he said.Heat can help cut down on the vapors, so you could microwave an onion before cutting it, Le said.Depending on the size of the onion, it should take anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes, he added.But Le only recommends doing this if you are making something where the onion’s texture isn’t that important because using the microwave can interfere with the crispness of the onion.Acids added to your onions may help reduce the stinging in your eyes and increase the flavor for your taste buds, Le said.The enzyme that converts amino acids in onions to cause the stinging feeling works well at a specific pH range, he said. An acid such as lemon or vinegar will slow down the enzyme making the vapors that lead to tears.Slowing the onion’s tear-inducing enzyme has another perk: It keeps the amino acid intact that gives the onion its flavor-enhancing ability in a recipe, Le said.Some people swear by lighting a candle while they cut up an onion. It’s possible that doing so could work, Le said.“I could see that working, but it really just depends on the kind of candle,” Le said. It could block the vapors, or a scented candle could have a reaction with the vapors that’s helpful.But it isn’t a guaranteed method, he added.“Maybe it’ll distract you with the nice-smelling ﻿odor,” Thiel said.Does it work to hold a piece of bread or toast in your mouth to avoiding crying or stop the tears? It’s hard to say, said Le, who is also the author of “150 Food Science Questions Answered.”Some people may find that this method cuts down on the stinging, teary feeling, but it is not one you can count on to work every time, he said.Le said he isn’t sure about the theory behind it. It could be the bread absorbing the vapor, or it could be psychological, he said."

        "category": "health",
        "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the first medication for a common form of liver inflammation called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, the agency said Thursday.NASH — also known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH — happens when the liver becomes inflamed because of excess fat cells that build up in the liver, leading to inflammation and scarring. It’s an advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; the disease is closely associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and a variety of other metabolic conditions such as high blood pressure. About 6 million to 8 million people in the US are thought to have NASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis, or scarring, the FDA says. Other complications associated with the condition include cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer.Up until now, there was no medication to treat the disease. Previous NASH treatment regimens focused on weight loss through lifestyle changes such as blood sugar control, a healthy diet and regular exercise.The new medication, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals’ resmetirom, will be marketed under the brand name Rezdiffra. It received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA in April. This status expedites the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and that preliminary clinical evidence indicates may be a substantial improvement over available therapies.The medication — which activates a thyroid hormone receptor in the liver to help reduce fat accumulation — is taken by mouth daily. It’s approved for people who have NASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis, and it’s intended to be used along with a healthy diet and exercise.Clinical trial results published in February showed that more than 25% of participants taking 80 milligrams of resmetirom achieved NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis, as did almost 30% of those taking 100 mg and less than 10% of participants who got a placebo. The medication also helped lower LDL or “bad” cholesterol levels and liver enzyme levels.It’s still not clear yet how long patients will need to take the medication. More research is needed.Most of the adverse events reported in the trial were mild or moderate; diarrhea and nausea were most common. Rezdiffra can have “potentially significant” interactions with certain other drugs, most notably statins to lower cholesterol, the FDA noted.Rezdiffra received what’s known as accelerated approval, and Madrigal must complete a post-approval study to verify the drug’s clinical benefit.“I believe this approval milestone will bring new energy and momentum to the NASH community, accelerating our efforts to improve disease education, build care pathways, and expand investment in NASH research,” Wayne Eskridge, CEO of the Fatty Liver Foundation, said in a news release from Madrigal on Thursday.Madrigal says that it expects Rezdiffra to be available next month and that it has set up an assistance program to help people who don’t have insurance access the drug.Dr. Pierre Gholam, a hepatologist at University Hospitals in Cleveland, said he hopes the approval of this drug will be the first of many that can improve the outcome of this disease. He’s happy he will finally have something to offer his patients with this disease.“It’s definitely a game-changer in that we have been trying to find a drug that works and that the FDA will approve in the broad category of steatotic liver disease or fatty liver disease for more than 15 years, but so far every drug that’s ever developed for this ended up not being approved,” Gholam said. “So it’s a very big deal.”"

        "title": "CDC team arrives in Chicago to help officials with response to measles outbreak linked to migrant shelter",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "A team of experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Chicago on Tuesday to help local public health officials manage a measles outbreak there.The Chicago Department of Public Health said last week that the city had its first measles case since 2019. The person is recovering well at home, the department said.The department announced Sunday that there were two unrelated measles cases among children at a migrant shelter in a large warehouse in the city’s Pilsen neighborhood. One child has recovered and is no longer infectious, the health department said. The second child is hospitalized but is in good condition.The department also announced two cases among adults in the shelter on Monday and three further cases Tuesday, bringing the total count citywide to eight. stable condition.The CDC, which sends its experts when requested by local authorities, says it has not sent personnel to other recent measles outbreaks.The CDC team will work closely with the city and state health departments to help identify people who may be at risk for getting sick. The team will provide clinical guidance, help coordinate testing and work with those on the ground to educate influential community leaders and clinicians who can emphasize how important it is to get vaccinated. The CDC will also provide guidance on a vaccination campaign covering certain schools, shelters and other congregate settings, as well as provide extra vaccines to ensure that there is an adequate supply for both adults and kids.“The majority of Chicagoans are vaccinated against measles and therefore are not at high risk but we are strongly urging those who aren’t vaccinated to do so as soon as possible, new arrivals and all Chicagoans. It is by far the best protection against measles, which for the first time in years is in our city,” Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Olusimbo “Simbo” Ige said in Sunday’s statement.“Because of how contagious measles is, I anticipate seeing more cases. Should you be exposed to someone who has measles, if you are not vaccinated you need to immediately quarantine and call a health provider. If you are not sure of your vaccination status, stay home and call your health provider as soon as possible.”Health care system Cook County Health said Monday that it was coordinating with other local departments to get in touch with patients and staff that were known to be in the vicinity of some of the patients with measles. The patients with measles had sought medical help from Stroger Hospital’s emergency department, Arlington Heights Health Center and the CCH’s Professional Building. In responding to the measles cases, Cook County Health said it followed all reporting protocols with local and state public health authorities.“We believe the risk to our staff is low, as vaccination is a requirement of employment at Cook County Health,” the health care system said. “We cannot emphasize enough how important vaccination is to preventing the spread of measles.”Measles is highly contagious and can cause serious symptoms that can lead to pneumonia and other potentially life-threatening complications, but it is preventable with vaccination.People who aren’t vaccinated against the virus can get sick if they breathe in contaminated air or touch a surface that someone infected with the measles has touched. It can linger in the area where someone has sneezed or coughed for about an hour or two, research shows.People who are infected can spread measles about four days before and four days after developing a rash that is a trademark of the virus, the CDC says.Measles typically starts with a mild to moderate fever, along with a runny nose, a cough, and red and watery eyes. Some people also have stomach problems.The illness can be particularly difficult for babies and young children.Most people in the US get a series of two measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shots in childhood. When it comes to preventing illness after exposure, the vaccine is considered more than 95% effective with a single dose and 97% effective after a second dose.“CDC continues to recommend the safe and effective MMR vaccination as part of the routine immunizations schedule for all children and adults, with special guidance for international travel,” the agency said in a statement Monday. “We will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available.”The Chicago health department said it has also teamed up with public health managers from Cook County Health, Rush University Medical Center and the University of Illinois-Chicago.Health workers assessed nearly all of the shelter’s residents over the weekend and vaccinated more than 900 of them, the Chicago health department says.More than 700 residents were found to have immunity from vaccination or infection, and they are allowed to come and go, the health department says. Those who have not been vaccinated or who were recently vaccinated by the city must quarantine for 21 days and monitor for symptoms.Cook County Health offers medical assessments to all new arrivals who go through the city intake process. The health care system said it has cared for 27,057 patients to date and have offered all essential vaccines including the MMR shot. The department said Monday that it has administered more than 73,400 vaccinations to new arriving patients to protect against measles, flu, Covid, varicella and other diseases.In May, officials said they expected an influx of migrants to follow the expiration of Title 42, a Trump-era pandemic public health order aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19. The policy became a key tool officials used to turn back migrants at the US-Mexico border. Then-CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at the time that communities may need to watch for possible cases of infectious disease.As in past situations, health care providers need to recognize that “we may have under-vaccinated people who are settling in communities, and we need to watch out for infectious threats,” she said.Measles is considered a disease that was eliminated from the US in 2000, but cases have been popping up across the country. An outbreak in Florida last month included several cases linked to children at an elementary school.As of March 7, the CDC said, 45 cases have been reported in 17 jurisdictions across the country this year. For all of last year, there were 58 cases in the US.About 92% of US children have been vaccinated against MMR by age 2, according to a 2023 report from the CDC – below the federal target of 95%.The percentage of kindergartners who got their state-required vaccines for measles also remained below the federal target for the 2022-23 school year, according to CDC data. And the rate of vaccine exemptions for children has reached the highest level ever reported in the US.Children should get two doses of the MMR vaccine, according to the CDC: the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age and the second at 4 to 6 years of age.Before the nation’s measles vaccination program, about 3 million to 4 million people got the virus every year, and about 400 to 500 died.CNN’s Amanda Musa, Jennifer Feldman and Carma Hassan contributed to this report."

        "title": "4,000-year-old vial contains ancient red lipstick, archaeologists say",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "A small stone vial discovered in southeastern Iran contained a red cosmetic that was likely used as a lip coloring nearly 4,000 years ago, according to archaeologists.The rare find is “probably the earliest” example of lipstick to be scientifically documented and analyzed, the researchers reported in February in the journal Scientific Reports.More than 80% of the analyzed sample was made up of minerals that produce a deep red color — primarily hematite. The mixture also contained manganite and braunite, which have dark hues, as well as traces of other minerals and waxy substances made from vegetables and other organic substances.“Both the intensity of the red coloring minerals and the waxy substances are, surprisingly enough, fully compatible with recipes for contemporary lipsticks,” the study authors noted.It’s not possible to exclude the possibility the cosmetic was used in other ways, say, as a blusher, according to lead study author Massimo Vidale, an archaeologist at the University of Padua’s Department of Cultural Heritage in Italy. But he said the homogenous, deep red color, the compounds used and the shape of the vial “suggested to us it was used on lips.”It’s one of the first examples of an ancient, red-colored cosmetic to be studied, he said, although it wasn’t clear why cosmetic preparations resembling lipstick were uncommon in the archaeological record.“We have no idea, for the moment. The deep red color we found is the first one we met, while several lighter-colored foundations and eye shadows had been identified before,” he said via email.The use of hematite — crushed red ocher — had been documented on stone cosmetic palettes from the late Neolithic, as well as in ancient Egyptian cosmetic vessels, according to Joann Fletcher, a professor in the University of York’s department of archaeology. Whether the vial from Iran was the earliest lipstick, “all comes down to what this new discovery was actually used for,” she said.“It is possible the contents of the vial were used as a lip colour. But they could also have been applied to give colour to the cheeks, or for some other purpose, even if the vial looks like a modern lipstick tube,” said Fletcher, who was not involved in the research, in an email.It is “very plausible” the artifact was a lipstick, said Laurence Totelin, a professor of ancient history in the School of History, Archaeology and Religion at Cardiff University specializing in Greek and Roman science, technology, and medicine.“As the authors point out, the recipe is not dissimilar to a modern one. The deep red colour is also what we would expect for lip make up,” said Totelin, who was not involved in the study, via email.“That said, the ingredients are also regularly found in the preparation of ancient medicines, and the vial has a shape that is not inconsistent with a pharmaceutical use,” Totelin said.Other products previously unearthed in Egypt and the Middle East and studied by archaeologists have included black kohl eyeliners and lighter-colored compounds used as eye shadows or foundations. Unlike other ancient cosmetics, the vial’s concoction had a low lead content. This low level, the researchers suggested, might mean the lipstick’s makers understood the dangers of consuming lead, a naturally occurring toxic metal that can cause numerous health problems.“There is a long and harsh debate among experts on the toxicity of lead compounds in cosmetics,” Vidale said.Earlier research on artifacts from the same region that Vidale was involved with “suggests that 5,000 years ago white lead was the base material for facial foundations, meanwhile the content of our deep red preparation, supposedly meant for lips, was almost lead-free. It might have been a conscious choice,” he said.The preparation contained quartz particles, from ground sand or crystal, perhaps added, the study suggested, as a ”shimmery-glittering agent” — although it was possible they came from the inside of the vial itself, which was finely crafted from a greenish stone called chlorite.It’s also not clear what the original consistency of the cosmetic would have been — a fluid or more solid, Vidale said.“The vial’s slender shape and limited thickness suggest that it could have been conveniently held in one hand together with the handle of a copper/bronze mirror, leaving the other hand free to use a brush or another kind of applicator,” the study authors wrote, citing an ancient Egyptian papyrus dated to the 12th century BC that depicts a young woman painting her lips in such a way as an example.The artifact was among thousands of items unearthed from Bronze Age tombs and graves in the Jiroft region of Iran. The graves — part of an ancient kingdom known as Marhasi — were exposed and dislodged in 2001 when a river flooded, after which their precious contents were looted and sold by locals. Many stone and copper items, including the vial, were subsequently recovered by Iranian security forces.The vial is kept in the National Archaeological Museum of Jiroft, where the team took samples.“Like a bolt out of the blue, this civilization was discovered … when a disastrous flood hit its ancient cemeteries, exposing all kinds of archaeological treasures,” Vidale said.“Now the region is well protected, but serious damages were done,” he added. “What we know today is that this was an advanced Mesopotamian-like civilization, a major player in long-distance trade and military ventures, which used its own writing system and was ruled by large cities and powerful, authoritative rulers. The rest is slowly emerging from new excavations.”It’s not clear who would have worn the lipstick — or in what context. “As far as we know, cosmetics were regularly deposited near the face of the deceased in the graves of the time,” Vidale said.However, given the looting and destruction of the graves, researchers have not been able to link the artifact with specific human remains."

        "title": "Why axolotls seem to be everywhere — except in the one lake they call home",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.Scientist Dr. Randal Voss gets the occasional reminder that he’s working with a kind of superstar. When he does outreach events with his laboratory, he encounters people who are keen to meet his research subjects: aquatic salamanders called axolotls.The amphibians’ fans tell Voss that they know the animals from the internet, or from caricatures or stuffed animals, exclaiming, “‘They’re so adorable, we love them,’” said Voss, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. “People are drawn to them.”Take one look at an axolotl, and it’s easy to see why it’s so popular. With their wide eyes, upturned mouths and pastel pink coloring, axolotls look cheerful and vaguely Muppet-like.They’ve skyrocketed in pop culture fame, in part thanks to the addition of axolotls to the video game Minecraft in 2021. These unusual salamanders are now found everywhere from Girl Scout patches to hot water bottles. But there’s more to axolotls than meets the eye: Their story is one of scientific discovery, exploitation of the natural world, and the work to rebuild humans’ connection with nature.Axolotl is a word from Nahuatl, the Indigenous Mexican language spoken by the Aztecs and an estimated 1.5 million people today. The animals are named for the Aztec god Xolotl, who was said to transform into a salamander. The original Nahuatl pronunciation is “AH-show-LOAT”; in English, “ACK-suh-LAHT-uhl” is commonly used.Axolotls are members of a class of animals called amphibians, which also includes frogs. Amphibians lay their jelly-like eggs in water, and the eggs hatch into water-dwelling larval states. (In frogs, these larvae are called tadpoles.)Most amphibians, once they reach adulthood, are able to move to land. Since they breathe, in part, by absorbing oxygen through their moist skin, they tend to stay near water.Axolotls, however, never complete the metamorphosis to a land-dwelling adult form and spend their whole lives in the water.“They maintain their juvenile look throughout the course of their life,” Voss said. “They’re teenagers, at least in appearance, until they die.”A signature feature of the axolotls’ forever-young look is their frilled external gills, which help them breathe in their watery home — the only spot they’re found in the wild: Lake Xochimilco in Mexico City.It’s a bit of a scientific mystery why axolotls don’t transform into adult, land-dwelling versions of themselves. One hypothesis, according to Dr. Luis Zambrano, a professor of zoology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, is that the environment in Lake Xochimilco had enough resources for the salamanders that “it was by far better for them not to expend energy transforming and stay in the lake.”The 10-square-mile Lake Xochimilco is a unique body of water, a natural drainage basin with slightly salty water. More than 1,000 years ago, Xochimilca people in the region invented an agricultural system of human-made floating islands called chinampas. The chinampa system, with its drainage canals surrounding the islands, is still used by farmers called chinamperos today. The islands provided habitats and hiding places for the axolotls, which thrived among the chinampas for 1,000 years.However, the chinampas of Lake Xochimilco are no longer thriving, and neither are the salamanders. “The problems started at the beginning of the last century,” Zambrano said.As Mexico City grew and became more industrialized, the need for water brought pumps and pipes to the lake, and eventually, “it was like a bad, smelly pond with rotten water,” Zambrano said. “All of our aquatic animals suffer with bad water quality, but amphibians suffer more because they have to breathe with the skin.”To add to the axolotls’ problems, invasive fish species such as carp and tilapia were introduced to the lake, where they feed on axolotl eggs. And a 1985 earthquake in Mexico City displaced thousands of people, who found new homes in the area around the lake, further contributing to the destruction of the axolotls’ habitat.These combined threats have devastated axolotl populations. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, there are fewer than 100 adult axolotls left in the wild. The species is considered critically endangered.While the wild axolotls of Lake Xochimilco have dwindled to near-extinction, countless axolotls have been bred for scientific laboratories and the pet trade. “The axolotl essentially helped establish the field of experimental zoology,” Voss said.In 1864, a French army officer brought live axolotls back to Europe, where scientists were surprised to learn that the seemingly juvenile aquatic salamanders were capable of reproduction. Since then, scientists around the world have studied axolotls and their DNA to learn about the salamanders’ unusual metamorphosis (or lack thereof) as well as their ability to regrow injured body parts.In addition to their role in labs, axolotls have become popular in the exotic pet trade (though they are illegal to own in California, Maine, New Jersey and Washington, DC). However, the axolotls you might find at a pet shop are different from their wild relatives in Lake Xochimilco. Most wild axolotls are a dark grayish brown. The famous pink axolotls, as well as other color variants such as white, blue, yellow and black, are genetic anomalies that are rare in the wild but selectively bred for in the pet trade.What’s more, “most of the animals in the pet trade have a very small genetic variance,” Zambrano said. Pet axolotls tend to be inbred and lack the wide flow of different genes that makes up a healthy population in the wild. That means that the axolotl extinction crisis can’t simply be solved by dumping pet axolotls into Lake Xochimilco. (Plus, the pet axolotls likely wouldn’t fare well with the poor habitat conditions in the lake.)The difficulties that axolotls face in the wild are almost diametrically opposed to the fame they’ve found in recent years. Axolotls have captured the human imagination for centuries, as evidenced by their roles in Aztec religion and stories, but the early 21st century seems to be a high point for them. An axolotl graces the 50 peso bill. There are axolotl-inspired Pokemon, and Reddit commenters have noted that the character Toothless from the “How to Train Your Dragon” movie series is distinctly axolotl-like.The introduction of axolotls to Minecraft in 2021 neatly mapped onto an uptick in Google searches for the animals, and social media makes it easy for people to gain access to photos and videos of the salamanders, particularly the photogenic pink ones often kept as pets.The axolotl pet trade probably doesn’t directly harm the wild populations since wild salamanders aren’t being poached or taken from Lake Xochimilco. However, Zambrano said, axolotls’ ubiquity in pop culture and pet stores might make people assume that because axolotls “live in all the tanks around the world, they are not in danger.”Zambrano has been working in axolotl conservation for more than two decades. It’s a somewhat unusual challenge, he said, because axolotls live so closely to so many people, so the answer to saving them isn’t simply to create a wildlife preserve and keep people out.“We have to be inventive in terms of the new ways of restoration and resilience and sustainable decisions,” he said.These new practices include outreach efforts that aim for “synergy between local knowledge and scientific knowledge,” Zambrano said, especially among the chinamperos whose families have farmed the islands in Lake Xochimilco for generations.A widespread return to the chinampa system, he said, would benefit the axolotls, because it would ensure cleaner habitat space for the salamanders than the lake’s current, more industrial uses provide.Such efforts would require policy changes, but according to Zambrano, worldwide enthusiasm for the axolotls could bolster such a campaign. People who love them can even symbolically adopt an axolotl to help fund conservation programs. Getting people to recognize that their favorite, friendly faced salamander doesn’t just exist in the vacuum of the internet, but in the real world where it faces dire conservation challenges, Zambrano said, is “a huge achievement.”Kate Golembiewski is a freelance science writer based in Chicago who geeks out about zoology, thermodynamics and death.

        "title": "This ‘6 to 1’ trick might make your grocery shopping easier",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Six veggies, five fruits, four proteins, three starches, two sauces and one fun thing — if that’s your grocery shopping list this week, you are probably a fan of Will Coleman, a New York City-based chef, television personality and social media content creator.Coleman went viral on TikTok after sharing his “6 to 1” method that he says will help you “spend less time in the grocery store and keep more money in your pockets.”“You’re also reducing your food waste, because you aren’t buying random ingredients that you don’t really need,” he added.Coleman originally posted about his shopping philosophy in March 2022.“I was personally spending a lot of money on groceries, entertaining with friends and creating content,” said Coleman, a prolific recipe developer who says this method changed his life.This weekly technique makes shopping more efficient and affordable, and allows you to add more variety, freshness and direction to your menu, according to Coleman. It also helps you keep your eye on the prize — adding what you really need to your cart — rather than getting distracted by the splashy items on supermarket endcaps (where grocers place items they want you to buy on impulse).Here is your 6 to 1 mission, should you choose to accept it: Seek out six fresh, frozen or canned vegetables, five fresh, frozen or canned fruits, four proteins, three starches, two sauces and one little luxury per supermarket trip. No matter where you shop, this should help you incorporate more variety and spice up your pantry staples without feeling overwhelmed by all the choices — and potentially overinvesting. (Coleman has guides for how he’s put the 6 to 1 method into practice at Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe’s and Publix.) Keep in mind that pop-in shops for forgotten items can be exempt from this practice.While the strategy originally came in handy for Coleman and his partner, he said that the 6 to 1 method “is for everyone.” Even folks cooking for one.You can use this process at the farmers market, the supermarket or your favorite specialty grocer based on how much you want to invest and what you have access to. Scale up or down by grabbing more of each ingredient to accommodate your household, Coleman said.Frances Largeman-Roth, a Dobbs Ferry, New York-based dietitian, mom of three and author of “Everyday Snack Tray: Easy Ideas and Recipes for Boards That Nourish for Moments Big and Small,” tried the 6 to 1 method and reported it worked.“There are so many benefits to including more diversity in your diet, from different types of produce to new grains, proteins and even cooking oils. Switching up what we usually buy could help us consume more nutrients,” Largeman-Roth said via email. “Plus, being flexible with shopping is what we all need to do if we want to save money.”The dietitian and mom said she appreciated how the 6 to 1 method built in structure, yet allowed for flexibility like opting for the store brand over the name brand, or trading an inflation-impacted protein, like eggs, for a more budget-friendly alternative, such as lentils. Largeman-Roth also awarded bonus points for the emphasis on fruits and vegetables.“We all need to be eating more of those, so I like his priorities. And you can definitely make several meals out of four proteins,” Largeman-Roth said. The starches, sauces and fun foods can help to round out the meal and keep you from feeling restricted or tempted to order takeout, she added.This shopping style still requires some meal planning.Regardless of your budget, nutrition goals or household size, “you can’t just roll up to the grocery store without a plan and think that 6 veggies and 4 proteins are going to get you through the week,” Largeman-Roth said.“You have to think about whether you’re going to put your chicken breasts with asparagus, and whether you need tortillas for the ground turkey you just bought. Even a rough plan is important for coming out of the store — or putting away items from your online grocery order—with the right mix of products to create meals with.”Peek at your pantry, refrigerator and freezer stock. Select the recipes first based on what you’re craving, Coleman recommended. Or if budget is the priority more than food waste and your mood, seek out what’s on sale, then retroactively find menu inspiration in cookbooks, on blogs or on Pinterest, he added.Keeping those pointers in mind, Largeman-Roth ended up with:If you’re comfortable in the kitchen, Coleman said “you can use all these ingredients to make spontaneous meals; pair them with items you already have in your pantry. Try pasta, a casserole, soup.” Or butternut squash and egg breakfast tacos with a fruit salad, shrimp and brussels sprout pasta with garlic olive oil sauce and sliders with a side salad. And, of course, berry-topped brownies for dessert.Not sure what to do with your ingredients? To help walk his fans through the aisles (and their meal prep), Coleman recently released a $10 e-book that includes three weeks of grocery lists and recipes that align with his method. (Or you can score one week for free.)“This is designed to save you some brain power and gets you cooking and eating more at home. Eventually, I want to do a game show where we put the 6-1 method to the test with families around the world,” Coleman said.Karla Walsh is a Des Moines, Iowa-based freelance lifestyle writer with more than 15 years of editorial experience."

        "title": "As more young people get colon cancer, it may be time for a colonoscopy",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Editor’s note: Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt is a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and past president of the Florida Urological Society.Colon cancer may seem like a distant concern for some, but with the growing trend of younger people being diagnosed, staying informed and proactive is crucial. March marks Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, a time to educate people about this prevalent and potentially lethal disease on the rise.As a surgeon, I’m acutely aware of the impact cancer can have. I lost a dear friend — a doctor, father and husband, just like myself — to colon cancer in 2017. He was only 38. His memory is a constant reminder of the importance of awareness and early detection in the fight against colon cancer.Just one year after I lost him, I started experiencing sharp abdominal pain and a change in my bowel habits. Never mind that I’m a urologist; I still freaked out and feared the worst. I consulted my doctor and underwent a CT scan, which thankfully showed no major cancers. Still, my doctor recommended that I have a colonoscopy.I was in my 30s, so I didn’t meet the criteria for a screening colonoscopy, but he needed it for diagnostic purposes to complete my workup for abdominal symptoms. Technically the colonoscopy was optional, but with my friend’s memory always on my mind, I did not hesitate.Most people should start screening with colonoscopies by age 45, experts recommend. A select group may need to start earlier than 45; beginning a conversation with your primary doctor can help with a road map on when to start and at what frequency.The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 106,590 new cases of colon cancer in the United States this year, nearly evenly split between men and women. The rate of diagnosis for colon cancer has been dropping overall since the mid-1980s, mainly because people are getting screened and changing lifestyle-related risk factors. However, this downward trend is mostly seen in older adults. For individuals younger than 55, rates have been increasing by 1% to 2% a year since the mid-1990s.Overall, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women. However, each person’s risk might be higher or lower than this, depending on their risk factors for colorectal cancer. Not everyone needs an early colonoscopy, but everyone should be aware of the signs, symptoms and benefits of screening.The colon, or large intestine, plays a crucial role in our digestive system, acting essentially as the waste processing and recycling center of the body. After the stomach and small intestine break down food and absorb nutrients, the colon manages what’s left. Its main job is to remove water and salts from this material, transforming it from a liquid state into solid waste or feces, or as my kids like to call it, poop.Beyond waste management, the colon also houses a complex microbiome, which plays a key role in overall digestive health, immune function and even mood regulation. The entire colon is about 5 feet (150 centimeters) long and divided into five major segments, with the rectum as the last anatomic segment before the anus. That’s why it’s called Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month and not just colon cancer awareness. Cancer can occur in any of these segments, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive colonoscopy when indicated.The preparation for a colonoscopy might be the most memorable part of the process. It’s less of a medical procedure and more of a rite of passage. The day before, you start on a bowel-cleaning cocktail meant to clear out the colon for optimal visualization during the colonoscopy.The “prep” is not as bad as one might think. Dehydration and exhaustion can occur, and I remember being unable to sleep the night before, still feeling the need to “go.” It was quite the experience but essential for a successful colonoscopy.A colonoscope, a camera on a flexible tube, takes a tour through your colon, transmitting live images that allow the doctor to spot any abnormalities. It’s akin to sending a rover to explore the moon or Mars. If doctors find something suspicious, such as a polyp, they can biopsy and/or remove it on the spot, preventing potential future complications. This proactive approach isn’t just diagnostic; it’s a powerful form of prevention that can offer peace of mind and actionable insights into your health.Fortunately for me, the colonoscopy revealed no signs of cancer, and my symptoms had already resolved by then. Although my procedure was primarily for diagnostic reasons, regular screenings are essential for many, serving as a key preventive measure.The US Preventive Services Task Force advises adults ages 45 to 75 to undergo regular colorectal cancer screenings, emphasizing the importance of early detection.Those with an elevated risk, perhaps due to family history or other factors, should consult their health care provider to determine the best screening schedule and methods tailored to their specific needs.Despite these recommendations, a significant portion of the eligible population hesitates to participate in screenings. Common deterrents include the discomfort associated with stool-based tests, the preparation required for procedures, and anxiety surrounding colonoscopy examinations.This apprehension may contribute to only about 60% of those eligible for colorectal cancer screenings staying up to date on the recommended tests. If it weren’t for the memory of my friend, I would have likely been in the “I’ll skip all this” group.In a promising development, a new blood-based screening test for colon cancer boasted an 83% effectiveness in detecting the disease, according to a study published March 13 in The New England Journal of Medicine. This test identifies DNA markers released by cancer cells in the blood, specific to colorectal cancer. While not a replacement for a colonoscopy, a positive result from this test indicates the need for further examination. The hope is, once approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, this blood test would increase screening for colorectal cancer.If you have any abnormal symptoms anywhere in your body, get checked. The earlier you do so, the longer you will likely live thanks to getting proactive care."

        "title": "CDC urges vaccination amid rise in measles cases in the US and globally",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "US health officials are warning doctors about the dramatic rise in measles cases around the world, and advising families traveling to a measles-affected country to get babies as young as 6 months vaccinated before they go.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert to doctors on Monday to increase awareness of the international spread of measles, and urged them to vaccinate infants a few months ahead of the typical schedule if families are planning to go abroad.The warning comes ahead of the busy spring and summer travel season. Many countries, including Austria, Philippines, Romania and the United Kingdom–destinations frequented by American tourists–are experiencing measles outbreaks, the CDC noted.The CDC also warned about lagging vaccination rates in 36 US states where fewer than 95% of kindergarteners have been vaccinated against measles, putting them below the herd immunity threshold. Herd immunity is the portion of the population that must be immunized against an infection to prevent its spread through the community.Even so, vaccination rates against measles in the U.S. are “pretty strong,” said Dr. Nirav Shah, CDC’s principal deputy director, so this isn’t a situation like Covid, where everyone is susceptible.“For vaccinated individuals … the likelihood of contracting measles is thankfully not what it was in days gone by because the vaccination rates are high,” Shah said. “That said, we are concerned that vaccination rates have fallen just a little bit from 95% to 93%.”Shah says two percentage points may not seem like a lot, but across the population, it represents about 250,000 kindergarteners who are unprotected.﻿The measles vaccines is considered one of the most protective. Two doses are about 97% effective at preventing infection, while a single dose is about 93% effective against infection.“The overwhelming scientific evidence shows that vaccines remain among the most effective and safest intervention to both prevent individual illness and protect the health of the public,” said Dr. Jesse Ehrenfeld, president of the American Medical Association, said in an emailed statement.In updated travel guidelines, the CDC is advising international travelers who are unsure about their vaccination status to see a doctor at least six weeks before their trip to make sure they have time to be fully immunized. Previous guidelines recommended seeing a doctor at least a month before the planned trip abroad.Normally, infants get their first measles, mumps and rubella shot at a year of age. The CDC says it is recommending the vaccination timeline be pushed up a few months to protect babies who have no immunity against the highly contagious infection.The CDC also recommends that unvaccinated children who are at least a year old get two doses of that measles containing vaccine at least 28 days apart before they travel.Measles virus can linger in the air for two hours after an infected person has passed through a room. People can also become infected if they touch a surface with virus particles, then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth. People can spread measles up to four days before and four days after they develop the characteristic rash.Approximately 9 out of 10 exposed individuals who don’t have immunity against the virus from previous infection or vaccination will catch it themselves.Travelers who get sick with a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes should seek medical attention, but the CDC advises giving the clinic some advance notice before you go, so they can take precautions to prevent potential measles spread.The CDC says that 46 countries currently have high numbers of measles cases, including 26 in Africa, four in Europe, eight in the Middle East, seven in Asia, and two in Southeast AsiaThe US has officially eliminated measles as an endemic infection, but the nation still sees imported cases every year. These cases are usually unvaccinated US residents who become infected during international travel.The US is on pace for a busy year. So far in 2024, the US has seen 58 measles cases in 17 jurisdictions, according to the CDC — the same number of cases seen in all of 2023 — and some were spread locally.Recent cases in the US have been reported in Chicago, California, Arizona, Florida and Pennsylvania.The CDC is warning all international travelers that they may be susceptible to measles if they have not been fully vaccinated at least two weeks prior to departure or have not had measles in the past.Measles can be severe in all age groups and can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia and death.Groups who are more likely to face severe complications include children younger than age 5, adults older than 20 years of age, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune function.Many countries have seen declines in childhood vaccinations. Over 61 million doses of vaccines that protect against measles were missed during the Covid-19 pandemic, increasing the risk of measles outbreaks, according to the CDC.That led to a steep rise in measles cases around the globe. For example, the WHO’s European region, which includes parts of Asia, had less than 1,000 measles cases in 2022 and more than 30,000 last year.WHO’s most recent data shows that measles cases jumped 18% around the globe last year to around 9 million. Measles deaths increased 43% to about 136,000."

        "title": "Interacting with dogs may affect multiple areas of the brain, study finds",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "If you decompress by playing with dogs or checking their adorable videos on social media, you might be onto something.Interacting with dogs in such ways may strengthen people’s brain waves associated with rest and relaxation, as measured by brain tests, according to a small study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One.Multiple studies have shown the emotional, physiological and cognitive benefits of interactions with animals, especially dogs — such as boosted energy, increased positive emotions or lowered risk for memory loss. That’s why animal-assisted health interventions are being increasingly used in diverse fields, the study authors said.Previous studies often took “a holistic approach, comparing people’s mood or hormone levels before and after spending time with a dog,” said the study’s first author, Onyoo Yoo, a doctoral student in the department of bio and healing convergence at Konkuk University’s graduate school in Seoul, via email.In this new study, Yoo and colleagues aimed to find out how mood was affected by specific activities — rather than just general interaction with a dog — by both objectively measuring brain activity and asking participants about their subjective emotions.The study involved 30 healthy adults who were around age 28 on average and had been recruited from pet salons and a dog grooming school in Seongnam, South Korea, between May and June 2022.In a drab, quiet room at a local grooming academy, each participant did eight activities with a 4-year-old, well-trained, female standard poodle owned by the study’s lead author. The activities included meeting, playing, feeding, massaging, grooming, photographing, hugging and walking the dog.Before activities began, participants sat and stared at the wall for three minutes to minimize any stimulation that could taint the results. The authors measured participants’ brain waves, using electroencephalogram tests, or EEGs, for three minutes during each activity.An EEG is a noninvasive test that measures electrical activity in the brain using small metal discs called electrodes, which are attached to the scalp. These tests provide “quick and accurate insights into unconscious processes that self-disclosure may not uncover,” Yoo said.After each task, the authors gave participants a couple of minutes to answer questionnaires on their emotional states. The whole process took around an hour.Different activities had varying effects on participants’ brain waves. Playing and walking with a dog increased the strength of the alpha-band oscillations, the authors found, which generally indicate stability and relaxation. Alpha wave activity has been linked with improved memory and reduced mental stress, according to the study.Grooming, playing and gently massaging the dog was linked with strengthened beta-band oscillation, which is associated with heightened attention and concentration. Participants also felt significantly less depressed, stressed and fatigued after interacting with the poodle.Since much of the research in this field has been anecdotal or subjective, though not surprising, “it is super exciting” that the new study provides more insight into exactly how the known benefits may be occurring, said Dr. Colleen Dell, a professor and research chair in One Health & Wellness at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, via email.“Studying the area in a multitude of ways — such as the EEG and subjective scales — is really important,” said Dell, who wasn’t involved in the study.While not all participants had pets of their own, “their fondness for animals likely motivated their willingness to participate in the experiment, potentially biasing the results,” Yoo said. “Animal-assisted therapy can be very beneficial for people who enjoy being around animals.”Beyond the changes in brain activity observed in the study, “this study was not designed to determine what mechanisms might link pet interactions to the observed changes in brain activity,” said Dr. Tiffany Braley, the Holtom-Garrett Family Professor of Neurology at the University of Michigan, who wasn’t involved in the study.However, the prefrontal cortex, one of the regions examined in this study, “is thought to be involved in emotional and social processing, offering the possibility that emotional or social bonding with animals could affect activity in this region,” Braley added via email. “Furthermore, prior studies have suggested that reduced cortisol levels and elevations in oxytocin may play a role in physiological changes associated with human-animal interactions.”The study did have some weaknesses, experts said — such as the low number of study participants and the fact they didn’t have mental, medical or neurological conditions, which could benefit the most from these types of interventions, Braley said. Additionally, the study didn’t have a control group to see if the actions, when done with a human instead of a dog, would have similar benefits.“It will be important to confirm the validity of these findings in future studies,” Yoo said.Though more studies are needed, if you already have a dog, there’s now more evidence supporting interactions with your pet, experts said.Most of these activities are likely enjoyed by your dog, Dell said, but pay attention to what they don’t like — some dogs don’t like to be hugged, for example.If you want to adopt a dog, there are several things you should consider. You would need extra money for at least pet supplies, health care, toys, food and pet sitting, all of which can add up to hundreds or thousands of dollars annually. If you adopt a puppy, it will need to be trained, and any new pet would need to be acclimated to a new environment regardless of age. Then there’s the quality time a dog needs on a regular basis.If you’re not ready for a pet but still want to obtain the benefits for emotional health, you might want to try playing with a loved one’s pet or visiting a local shelter or pet store that allows playing with the dogs even if you’re not going to adopt them. Doing so is especially encouraged at places with lots of puppies since the quality time helps socialize them.Recognition of the dog’s welfare is important, Dell said, “because if the dog is not healthy and happy then they (also) cannot participate in the intervention fully.”"

        "title": "Dark roasted and dangerous: Everything you should know about caffeine intoxication",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "For many Americans, a morning routine is not complete without a cup of joe. The National Coffee Association reports the average American drinks just over three cups daily. And some people opt to get their caffeine through energy drinks or caffeine pills.While everyone’s tolerance is different, there is a limit to how much caffeine people can have in their systems. Jittery fingers and a racing heartbeat are common signs that you’re over-caffeinated. In rarer scenarios, an overconsumption of caffeine can lead to a state called caffeine intoxication or caffeine overdose.Caffeine intoxication occurs when a person has dangerously high levels of caffeine in the system. It creates a spectrum of unpleasant and severe symptoms, such as trouble breathing and seizures. There are a few cases where people have died from caffeine intoxication.While rare, there is always a potential for caffeine intoxication if a person is drinking irresponsibly. Recognizing the signs and factors that increase the risk of a caffeine overdose can help you avoid it in the first place.Caffeine intoxication is more than the headache you get from drinking too much expresso. It happens when people ingest an excessive amount of caffeine. The US Food and Drug Administration defines this limit as anything more than 400 milligrams of caffeine daily for healthy adults. This is equivalent to four or five cups of coffee.Consuming slightly more than 400 milligrams of caffeine is not enough to kill or permanently impair someone, said Erin Palinski-Wade, a registered dietitian at EKP Nutrition Communications in New Jersey. The average adult will likely feel anxious and irritable. The more toxic effects of caffeine intoxication appear when people have 1,200 milligrams, about 12 cups of coffee, in their system.Caffeine intoxication creates a variety of severely damaging effects on the body.Nima Majlesi, director of medical toxicology at Staten Island University Hospital, said the stimulant effects of caffeine disrupt your normal heart rhythm, leading to abnormal heartbeats and possible cardiac arrest. Additionally, Palinski-Wade said people with a caffeine overdose may experience gastrointestinal issues such as vomiting and diarrhea.Since coffee increases urination, Majlesi said severely over-caffeinated people risk flushing out essential minerals, especially potassium. Low potassium levels, or hypokalemia, can damage muscles to the point of possible paralysis, cause difficulty breathing from weakened respiratory muscles and prevent kidneys from doing their job.A number of caffeine intoxication symptoms are also neurological. Documented cases have reported anxiety, hallucinations, migraines, swelling of the brain and seizures.While extremely uncommon, caffeine intoxication can turn lethal. Most accidental caffeine-related deaths are related to taking multiple high-dose caffeine pills. Caffeine pills are not FDA-regulated, so their doses vary across brands.Palinski-Wade said most caffeine pills have around 300 milligrams, so taking a second one already would exceed the recommended caffeine intake of 400 milligrams. “Like with any supplement, caffeine pills should be used with caution,” she added. “I would even discuss it with your health care provider because pills are absorbed in the body quicker, and the amount might put you at risk for more side effects.”If you’re experiencing more than a few jitters and suspect caffeine intoxication, go to the emergency room immediately, Majlesi said. He explained doctors can use hemodialysis to filter out caffeine from the blood. If a person consumed large amounts of caffeine within one to two hours, Majlesi added that doctors may also dispense activated charcoal, which binds to caffeine and prevents it from getting absorbed in the gut.Doctors will also administer medications to stabilize the patient and treat severe symptoms. For example, Majlesi said beta-blockers and benzodiazepines are often prescribed to treat neurological issues such as hallucinations and seizures.Both Majlesi and Palinski-Wade advised monitoring how much caffeine you are consuming daily. Coffee is a popular source of caffeine, but products such as sodas, green tea and cacao can add to your caffeine intake.Majlesi warned against energy drinks and caffeine powders because of the high caffeine concentrations. Both products are supplements and may also contain large amounts of sugar and other stimulants such as guarana.Once you’ve decided on your caffeinated drink, Palinski-Wade advised to drink water throughout the day. Staying hydrated can help replenish water-soluble vitamins since caffeine is a diuretic.Having food in your stomach — especially a meal high in protein and fiber — can also help by allowing the body to absorb caffeine over a longer period, Palinski-Wade said. “You might experience fewer side effects versus if you were having it on an empty stomach,” she added.All in all, caffeine intoxication is preventable. The most important thing is to listen to your body and what it can tolerate, Palinski-Wade said. So, the next time you’re staring back at an empty mug, take a moment and see if you really need another refill or if you may be better served by a water break.Jocelyn Solis-Moreira is a freelance health and science journalist based in New York."

        "title": "Online orders begin for first over-the-counter birth control pill in the US",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "The rollout is underway for Opill, the first over-the-counter birth control pill approved in the United States, and online sales began Monday morning.Consumers can start ordering Opill online Monday, and orders will be fulfilled within a day or two, Sara Young, senior vice president and chief consumer officer at Perrigo, said in an email. So far, the product will be available at Opill.com and Amazon.“Because privacy is important to Perrigo, Opill orders will be sent in plain, unbranded boxes,” Young wrote.Opill has a suggested retail price of $19.99 for a one-month supply, $49.99 for a three-month supply, and at Opill.com, a six-month supply will be available for $89.99.Earlier this month, the first shipments of Opill were sent to distributors, major drug stores and pharmacies — but as those shipments make their way through the distribution pipeline, it can take days to weeks before customers are able to get their hands on the product.That timeline includes shipments arriving at distribution sites and then being delivered to retailers, and then the retailers either packaging the product for online orders or placing it on store shelves.Some major retail pharmacies, such as CVS and Walgreens, have said they will offer Opill once they receive their shipments.“Opill will be available at CVS.com and through the CVS Pharmacy app in late March,” spokesperson Matt Blanchette wrote in an email. “In early April more than 7,500 CVS Pharmacy stores will offer Opill and for added privacy and convenience, customers will be able to choose same-day delivery or buy online and pick-up in store.”Online access to Opill will benefit women who live in remote rural areas or who may not have access to transportation in order to travel to stores that carry it, said Dr. Anne-Marie Amies Oelschlager, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who specializes in adolescent care.“The biggest population that will benefit from this are those who have limited access to contraception in the first place. There are a lot of people in our country that live in what we would call contraceptive deserts, and these are areas where they have limited to no access to a reproductive health care provider, meaning they’d have to drive really far away to be able to access a provider, or they may not have access to a pharmacy close by,” Oelschlager said.“In particular, this can impact adolescents who are often reliant on an adult to provide the transportation or the resources to be able to go to a provider, and this allows them to also access contraceptives with more privacy,” she said. “Similarly, people who may be in a domestic violence situation where there may be a component of contraceptive sabotage, where someone is either preventing them from using contraception or messing with their birth control, this way, they can access contraception without someone else’s knowledge.”The more avenues through which people can access contraception – whether it’s over the counter in a store or online – the more control they can have over their reproductive health and choices, said Megan Kavanaugh, a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that has been tracking the rollout of Opill.“Having online options for people who are very tech-savvy and comfortable navigating the online environment, which we know younger people are better at anyway, is a great option,” Kavanaugh said.“Of course, it’s also really important to have pharmacies and physical locations where other folks who need to overcome the barrier of the prescription requirements can get that over-the-counter option and maybe even interface with a pharmacist if they want to,” she said. “There’s no requirement that they need to do that, but it’s great to have as many options as available for people.”Last year, when the US Food and Drug Administration approved Opill for use without a prescription and with no age limit, public health experts applauded the move as a milestone for the expansion of access to contraception in the United States. Now that the rollout has begun, however, there is some concern that states could place restrictions on that access.“We live in a time when everything having to do with people’s sexual and reproductive health, and people’s ability to realize their reproductive goals and pursue reproductive freedoms, is unfortunately politicized,” Kavanaugh said.No states have made such proposals or actions on restricting access to Opill, but the concern stems from the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision in 2022, which reversed Roe v. Wade and overturned the constitutional right to an abortion.“We are concerned about access to all forms of sexual reproductive health care. So of course the Dobbs decision directly impacted abortion access, but we’ve seen evidence that it has trickled out and impacted sexual and reproductive health care, and contraceptive care,” said Kavanaugh, who testified at a FDA public hearing last year in support of approving Opill without an age restriction.“It’s a huge milestone that Opill is available over the counter,” she said. “And I think we should really celebrate the milestone, and we should situate this milestone on this trajectory of always wanting to move towards increased access for all people.”When considering the debate around abortion access in the United States, Oelschlager said that “if people really want to decrease unintended pregnancies – and by decreasing unintended pregnancies, decrease abortion – they should be supporting increased access to contraception.”Because the FDA approved Opill without an age restriction, people who have started menstruating and those going through perimenopause can purchase it, Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University, said this month. In her previous role as health commissioner of Baltimore, she oversaw city-run reproductive health clinics.“Opill should be considered by individuals who desire birth control but are unable to see a primary care physician, gynecologist or other provider who can prescribe birth control pills,” she said.Some states may try to enforce age restrictions on Opill, Dr. Vineeta Gupta, executive director for the nonprofit the Network for Public Health Law, said in an email.There are age restrictions on certain medications on a state-by-state basis in other contexts, such as with over-the-counter drugs containing the cough suppressant dextromethorphan, said Gupta, who wrote a blog post about this topic.In 2012, California became the first state to prohibit the sale of cough medicines containing dextromethorphan to minors, and since then, governors from several other states have signed similar laws.Separately, when it comes to Plan B emergency contraception, there have been some attempts to enforce state-by-state differences in age restrictions, too.Plan B was approved for over-the-counter use for adults in 2006, and in 2013, it was approved for all ages. That year, “Oklahoma passed a law requiring anyone 17 and under to obtain a prescription before Plan B could be dispensed to them. The state was sued and the plaintiffs, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, prevailed. The law was held to be unconstitutional because it violated the state’s single subject rule,” Gupta said in the email. That rule prohibits individual pieces of legislation or ballot initiatives from addressing more than one issue or unrelated issues in a single law.But these examples have not set a precedent for what type of authority states may have to restrict access to an FDA-approved medication, Gupta said.When it comes to Opill, “many states also allow pharmacists to refuse to participate in ‘health care’ that they find morally objectionable. This could include providing individuals with Opill even though it is OTC,” she said. “Legal approval and actual access are two distinct issues, with the latter influenced by a broader set of factors including state policies, healthcare practices, and socio-economic determinants of health.”"

        "title": "US abortions reach highest level in over a decade, sparked by surge in medication abortion",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Abortions are on the rise in the United States, despite bans that have taken effect in more than a dozen states since the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that revoked the federal right to abortion in June 2022.There were more than 1 million abortions in the US in 2023, the highest rate in more than a decade and a 10% jump from 2020, according to a report released Tuesday by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights. The latest trends also suggest that medication abortion is a more common option than ever.Although abortions all but stopped in the 14 states with total bans, nearly every other state had an increase in the number of abortions provided from 2020 to 2023. As the geography of abortion care shifted amid a fractured policy landscape, the 10% increase in abortions nationwide meant that states without total bans saw a 25% increase in those years.The “drastic loss of access in states with bans has been counterbalanced by monumental efforts on the part of clinics, abortion funds and logistical support organizations to help people in ban states access care through financial and practical support,” the authors of the report wrote.States bordering those with bans had particularly large increases, but abortions also increased in other states where they remained legal.“It is very possible that, while access was dramatically curtailed for people living in ban states, access substantially improved for residents of states without bans,” the authors wrote.In addition to states policies enacted to protect patients and access to care and increased financial support from abortion funds, researchers from the Guttmacher Institute suggest that improved access to telehealth in recent years may have made medication abortion more broadly available.Medication abortion has become more common than ever post-Roe, according to another new Guttmacher report. Nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the US in 2023 – an estimated 642,700 – were medication abortions, the report says.Medication abortion, also known as medical abortion, is a method by which someone ends their pregnancy by taking two pills – mifepristone and misoprostol – rather than having a surgical procedure.This option has become steadily more common over the two decades it’s been available, rising from less than 10% of all abortions in the US in 2001 to 53% in 2020 and 63% in 2023.But mifepristone, the drug that was approved for abortion use by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2000, faces an unprecedented legal challenge. On March 26, the US Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case that puts access to the medication at stake – even in states where abortion remains legal – and raises questions about the authority that courts have to overrule determinations by FDA experts about a drug’s safety.Misoprostol can be used on its own for a medication abortion and is a safe alternative, but research suggests that using both pills together is the gold standard.Research has long found that medication abortion is safe and effective, but another recent study found that to be true even when the patient gets the medicine through a telehealth appointment.“Any return to restrictions on medication abortion provision via telemedicine would be detrimental for people who either prefer or only have access to abortion using telemedicine,” the Guttmacher researchers wrote in the new report. “While the current court case only affects use of mifepristone — and a misoprostol-only regimen is also a safe and effective method of medication abortion — everyone seeking an abortion should have access to the full range of safe, effective options.”The new reports from Guttmacher estimate abortion trends based on responses from a sample of abortion providers in the US. They probably undercount the number of abortions in the US, as the data does not include abortions that happen outside of the formal health care system or medication abortions that were sent to people in states where abortion is banned.CNN’s Jen Christensen and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report."

        "title": "Asian elephants bury their dead, study suggests",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Researchers in India have for the first time documented how Asian elephants bury dead calves.Five calves were found buried on their backs in drainage ditches in tea gardens in northern Bengal, according to a new study.While African elephants are known to bury dead calves, this is the first time that the behavior has been documented in Asian elephants, study author Akashdeep Roy, a researcher at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), told CNN on Wednesday.The burials were documented in areas home to fragmented forests and agricultural lands such as tea gardens, said Roy.Herds of elephants use trails that snake through tea gardens on their journeys through the countryside, he added.In the past, elephants would have stayed mostly in the forests, but in recent decades they have become more comfortable in areas with a human presence, said Roy.While elephants would not bury their dead in villages due to the high probability of human disturbance, the tea garden drainage ditches are a “perfect site” for calf burials, he explained.“They hold the carcass with the legs or the trunk, it’s the only way they can get a grip on the carcass,” said Roy, who added that laying the body in the ditch and then covering it with mud is the easiest way for elephants to achieve a burial.Roy said he and his co-author Parveen Kaswan of the Indian Forest Service were in the area to carry out other research when they found evidence of calf burials.“We were surprised by this obviously,” said Roy.The researchers also looked at whether the Asian elephants would revisit burial sites, as African elephants are known to do, but found that instead they would tend to avoid the area, said Roy.This is the case even though the Indian Forest Service removes the bodies, said Roy, who believes that even elephants from different herds from that which carried out the burial can sense a burial site.“They know many things that we don’t know,” he said.Roy told CNN that he intends to keep looking for more cases of calf burials in northern Bengal and Assam, which are home to many tea gardens.The team will use drones, as well as asking tea garden managers and local residents to report any burial sites, he added.Joshua Plotnik, assistant professor of psychology at Hunter College in New York, who was not involved in the study, believes there could be a simpler explanation for these apparent burials.“While there are observed instances of elephants carrying calf carcasses, to my knowledge, none of my colleagues, including many that have observed elephants for decades, have observed elephants burying their dead,” Plotnik, who studies cognition in elephants and other animals, told CNN.An alternative explanation is that the calves fell into these ditches, couldn’t get out and then died there, with the dirt either falling in naturally after they died or evidence of an attempted rescue by other members of the herd, he said.“The important point here is that more evidence is needed – direct observations of the burials and the elephants’ behavior, for example – before any conclusions about what is happening here can be drawn,” said Plotnik.Roy contests this theory, explaining that contusions on the backs of the dead calves show that they were dragged to their resting place by other members of the herd.The study was published in the Journal of Threatened Taxa on February 26."

        "title": "Deadly illness outbreak linked to morel mushrooms may have stemmed from preparation, CDC says",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Although morels are generally considered safe, the mushrooms were at the heart of a deadly illness outbreak in Montana last year. An investigation from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, detailed in a report published Thursday, tried to solve the mystery about exactly what went wrong.Morels, which many consider to be a delicacy, have a honeycomb-like appearance and emerge from the ground for just a few weeks early in the year.“They are the harbinger of spring, the first to appear usually, and that adds to their mystique,” said Dr. Greg Mueller, chief scientist emeritus at the Chicago Botanic Garden.Mushroom hunters consider morels one of the most prized varieties, and they’re often featured on higher-end restaurant menus.“They’re very tasty,” said Dr. Matthew Nelsen, a research scientist at the Field Museum in Chicago.That may be why a restaurant at the center of the CDC investigation – identified by a state report as Dave’s Sushi in Bozeman, Montana – featured morels as a part of a special sushi roll made with salmon and a handful of other menu items between March and April 2023. When two people died after eating them, though, the CDC was brought in to help investigate what went wrong.The local health department put out a news release to ask the public to report other potential related illnesses, and a number of people called to say they too had become violently ill after eating at the restaurant.In the end, 51 people reported getting sick after eating there, and 45 of them reported eating the morels during March and April of last year.Most of the customers who got sick reported vomiting and serious/severe diarrhea. Four were so sick that they went to the emergency room, and three were hospitalized, in addition to the two people who died, both of whom had underlying health conditions.The CDC investigation determined that the morel mushrooms were cultivated and imported fresh from China. They were also distributed to restaurants in California, but no one reported being sick in that state.Investigators learned that the difference between the morels eaten by people who got sick and those who didn’t may have been in how they were prepared.At the Montana restaurant, the morels were served lightly cooked or raw. At the California restaurants, the morels were thoroughly cooked.“Although the toxins in morel mushrooms that might cause ill­ness are not fully understood, proper preparation procedures, including thorough cooking, might help to limit adverse health effects,” the report said.The CDC recommends that morels be refrigerated at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 degrees Celsius), in breathable-type packaging such as a paper bag, and should be cooked thoroughly before being served.“I recommend cooking all mushrooms, including morels,” Mueller said. “A lot of mushrooms have various toxins that get broken down when they’re cooked, and that makes them safer. Personally, I think that makes them taste a lot better too, since raw mushrooms don’t have a lot of flavor.”Looking at data for the past 15 years, he said, there are only about 150 reports of mushroom sickness from morels.“It’s definitely not common, but it happens, and in almost every case, they were eaten raw or undercooked,” Mueller said.Some people get sick even when they are cooked, Nelsen said, so he suggests starting with a small serving if you don’t know how your body will react to them.“There’s a lot we don’t know about morels. Different mushrooms affect people differently,” he said. “There’s still a lot of work to be done still to figure out exactly what it is that is making people sick.”Muller and Nelsen added that people foraging for morels should be sure to pick true morels, not mushrooms known as false morels, because those have toxins in them that could cause serious illness even after cooking."

        "title": "Nutritionist-approved tips for a healthy Ramadan fasting",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, during which observant Muslims observe a strict fast from dawn until sunset. Maintaining a balanced diet during this holy month is necessary in order to keep the body energized for prayer and other practices throughout the day.Dietician Rahaf Al Bochi, recipe developer for the CNN newsletter Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style, shares her thoughts on how to eat healthily and stay hydrated while fasting.This conversation was edited and condensed for clarity.CNN: First, when can you eat during Ramadan?Rahaf Al Bochi: The first meal you eat is suhoor, the predawn meal. It is like breakfast, but you get to have it earlier. You want to make sure that you’re not skipping that. At sunset, you have iftar, which is the breaking of your fast.CNN: What’s the best way to break your fast?Al Bochi: In our prophetic tradition, the recommendation is to break the fast with dates and water. Dates are a great source of quick energizing sugar, which is what you want when you’re fasting during the day. They also have some fiber, and when you pair them with a protein source like some nuts, it can prevent a sharp spike in blood sugar. Some options are nut butter, almonds or walnuts. Depending on their size, you also don’t want to eat 10 dates, just one or two.When breaking fast, you’ll want to pace yourself and not jump into eating your main meal. Take a few minutes to do your prayer and then come back to eat. Listen to your hunger and fullness cues and check in with yourself that you’re eating slowly, chewing the food and enjoying it.CNN: What should a meal include?Al Bochi: When you’re building your meal, make sure you have complex carbohydrates, fiber-rich carbohydrates, protein and healthy fat. A great visual to use is the healthy plate model. It can help you balance your macronutrients, meet your energy needs and portion-size food groups.Envision your plate and divide it in half. One-half of your plate should be for non-starchy vegetables or a salad. Then a quarter of your plate should be for complex carbohydrates that are fiber-rich, such as quinoa or potatoes. Fruits can also go on there. The last quarter of your plate is for protein so that’s your chicken, beef and other meats.CNN: Can you give me some examples of a typical meal for suhoor and iftar?Al Bochi: When it comes to the predawn meal, you’re getting enough protein to sustain you. The reason we focus on protein and healthy fats is that they are slower to digest in your body. These are the foods that will give you energy throughout the day. Examples are eggs, avocados and toast, overnight oats, Greek yogurt bowls, protein waffles and burritos stuffed with beans and eggs.People like to eat rice, chicken, salad and soup for dinner. For the iftar meal, make sure you are incorporating those types of foods with the healthy plate model.CNN: Are there foods you recommend people avoid during Ramadan?Al Bochi: Honestly, I don’t like to tell people you shouldn’t totally avoid foods, but there are some you can be mindful of, like sweetened beverages and fried foods. A lot of cultural foods tend to be fried, so enjoy them in moderation. Make sure your other foods are balanced and more nutritionally dense.CNN: Do you have any tips for staying hydrated when fasting?Rahaf Al Bochi: It’s really important to make sure you’re adequately hydrating during the non-fasting hours. That can mean taking a water bottle with you if you go outside for nightly prayers. Teas, soups, and fruits with high water content like watermelon all count toward your fluid intake.Another great tip is to add electrolytes to water. Electrolytes help your body absorb the water you are drinking and add extra potassium, sodium and vitamin C. Mix a no-added-sugar electrolyte powder into your water or make your own with coconut water, a pinch of salt and a splash of orange juice.CNN: Coffee can be very dehydrating. Should people cut back on their caffeine intake during Ramadan?Rahaf Al Bochi: Honestly, it’s a personal decision. If you’re a coffee drinker and then abruptly stop during Ramadan, you might experience some headaches. I recommend my clients taper down their caffeine intake, though it depends on how much they are currently drinking. Some people love their caffeine and will drink their coffee at the predawn meal, suhoor.To have an energized Ramadan, optimize your nutrition. Balance your meals using the healthy plate model, drink enough water and add electrolytes as needed. Finally, remember to enjoy your cultural foods. We want to still enjoy the foods we’re eating."

        "title": "Blood pressure is best lowered by 2 exercises, study finds",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "When it comes to lowering blood pressure, studies have typically shown that aerobic or cardio exercises are best.Recent research suggests another type of physical activity is worth including as an effective tool to prevent and treat hypertension, or high blood pressure.Exercises that engage muscles without movement — such as wall squats and planks — may be best for lowering blood pressure, according to a large study published July 2023 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.This type of training is known as isometric, or static, exercise, according to the Mayo Clinic. Isometric muscle action happens when muscles contract but do not visibly change length, and the joints involved don’t move, facilitating stability of the body.Isometric exercises can be done with weights or without, just relying on the body’s own weight.“Overall, isometric exercise training is the most effective mode in reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure,” said study coauthor Dr. Jamie O’Driscoll in a news release. He is a reader in cardiovascular physiology at Canterbury Christ Church University’s School of Psychology and Life Sciences in England.“These findings provide a comprehensive data-driven framework to support the development of new exercise guideline recommendations for the prevention and treatment of arterial hypertension.”Existing guidelines on exercise for blood pressure management — which emphasize aerobic or cardio exercises such as running or cycling — are effective but also based on old research that excludes more recently adopted exercise protocols such as high-intensity interval training and isometric training, the authors said.The researchers felt the guidelines were outdated and in need of review, so they looked into randomized controlled trials that had reported the effects of exercise interventions, lasting two or more weeks, on systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure between 1990 and February 2023.Systolic blood pressure measures the maximum pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts and relaxes, while diastolic blood pressure denotes what the arterial pressure is when the heart rests between beats, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The authors defined healthy resting blood pressure as a reading below 130 over 85 millimeters of mercury — a measurement of pressure known as mmHg — pre-high blood pressure as ranging from 130/85 mmHg to 139/89 mmHG, and high blood pressure as 140/90 mmHG or greater. The top numbers of these figures are the systolic pressure; the bottom numbers are diastolic pressure.From a review of 270 trials with 15,827 participants — which is known as a meta-analysis — the authors found that among HIIT, isometric exercise, aerobic exercise, dynamic resistance training and a combination of the latter two, isometric exercise led to the greatest reductions in blood pressure.“The reductions in blood pressure after aerobic exercise training amounted to 4.49/2.53 mmHg; 4.55/3.04 mmHg after dynamic resistance training; 6.04/2.54 mmHg after combined training; 4.08/2.50 mmHg after HIIT; and 8.24/4 mmHg after isometric exercise training,” according to a news release.Performing wall squats (isometric exercise) was most effective for reducing systolic pressure, and running (aerobic exercise) was most beneficial for decreasing diastolic pressure, but isometric exercise overall was best for lowering both pressure elements.“It’s encouraging to see other forms of exercise explored in this research as we know that those who take on exercise they enjoy tend to carry on for longer, which is key in maintaining lower blood pressure,” said Joanne Whitmore, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, via email. Whitmore wasn’t involved in the study.“However, it’s important to note that there are other lifestyle changes as well as exercise that can benefit your blood pressure,” she added. “These include keeping to a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, cutting down on salt, not drinking too much alcohol and ensuring that you continue to take any prescribed medication.”More research is needed to determine exactly why isometric exercises might be better for lowering blood pressure than other types of training, the authors said.The authors said their findings should inform future guidelines about exercise for blood pressure.Guidelines by the World Health Organization say people should do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise weekly, which includes two strength-based training sessions.“This research fits very nicely into those guidelines,” said Jim Pate, senior exercise physiologist at Marylebone Health Group in London, who wasn’t involved in the study.QUIZ: Does your workout routine match your goals?You can do a wall squat or sit by standing with your back flat against a wall, then walking your feet about 1½ feet (0.5 meter) out from the wall, with your feet shoulder-width apart, according to the Arthritis Foundation. With your back flat against the wall and your abs tight, inhale and then exhale as you squat as low as you can comfortably go without your butt going lower than your knees. Remain squatting until you feel pain, then inhale as you stand, pushing up from your heels. The Arthritis Foundation recommends doing 10 wall squats three times weekly.Isometric training programs usually involve four two-minute contractions, separated by one- to four-minute rest intervals, done three times per week, according to the study.If you have a heart condition, talk with your doctor about the best exercise for you, Whitmore said.“People with health conditions should not be afraid to exercise in safe ways,” Pate said via email. “But seeking a professional who has experience with clinical exercise, like a sport and exercise medicine doctor, physiotherapist or clinical exercise physiologist, can help provide the structure and reassurance to make it achievable.”"

        "title": "Diet drinks may boost risk of dangerous heart condition by 20%, study says",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Drinking two liters or more per week of artificially sweetened beverages — the equivalent of a medium-sized fast-food diet soda a day — raised the risk of an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation by 20% when compared to people who drank none, a new study found.Known as A-fib, atrial fibrillation is an irregular heartbeat often described by many people who have it as a “quiver,” “flutter” or “flip-flop” of the heart in the chest.Drinking a similar number of added-sugar beverages raised the risk of the condition by 10%, while drinking about four ounces of pure, unsweetened juices, such as orange or vegetable juice, was associated with an 8% lower risk of atrial fibrillation, the study found.“This is the first study to report an association between no- and low-calorie sweeteners and also sugar-sweetened beverages and increased risk of atrial fibrillation,” said Penny Kris-Etherton, a professor emeritus of nutritional sciences at the Pennsylvania State University, in a statement. She was not involved in the new study.While the study could only show an association between sweetened drinks and A-fib, the relationship remained after accounting for any genetic susceptibility to the condition. A 2017 study found people with European ancestry had about a 22% risk of inheriting the condition.“We still need more research on these beverages to confirm these findings and to fully understand all the health consequences on heart disease and other health conditions,” said Kris-Etherton, who is also an American Heart Association nutrition committee member.“In the meantime, water is the best choice, and, based on this study, no- and low-calorie sweetened beverages should be limited or avoided,” she added.Atrial fibrillation is the leading cause of stroke in the United States. In addition, strokes connected to A-fib tend to be “more severe than strokes with other underlying causes,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Atrial fibrillation can also lead to blood clots, heart failure and “can increase the risk for heart attack, for dementia, for kidney disease. All of those things are likely long term risks,” Dr. Gregory Marcus, professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and associate chief of cardiology for research at UCSF Health, told CNN in a prior interview.Nearly 40 million people worldwide are living with atrial fibrillation, 6 million of those in the United States alone, according to the Heart Rhythm Society, who represents more than 7,000 specialists in cardiac rhythm disorders from more than 90 countries.Many of those people suffer chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath and fatigue. But for others, A-fib is symptomless, a potentially silent killer. Once detected, however, the condition can be treated with medications, lifestyle changes and if necessary, surgeries to slow or restore the heart’s normal rhythm.The rate of atrial fibrillation in the US population is growing: The CDC estimates some 12 million Americans will have A-fib by 2030.“Age is one of the most important risk factors, so with the aging of the population it’s becoming more common,” Marcus said.The epidemic of obesity is also contributing to the growing numbers, along with other risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, smoking and drinking alcohol.“Previous research has shown high soft drink consumption to be association with increased risk of AF (atrial fibrillation),” said Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, in a statement. He was not involved in the new study.“Risk of AF is well known to be associated with type 2 diabetes, binge drinking of alcohol (commonly called holiday heart) as well as illicit drug use (cocaine),” Sanders said.The study, published Tuesday in the journal Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology, analyzed data on nearly 202,000 people participating in a large, biomedical database called the UK Biobank. Followed for an average of 10 years, people in the analysis ranged in age from 37 to 73 years old, and more than half were female.Higher consumers of artificially sweetened beverages were more likely to be female, younger, weigh more and have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, the study found. Those who drank more sugar-sweetened beverages were more likely to be male, younger, weigh more and have a higher prevalence of heart disease.People who drank both sugar-sweetened beverages and pure juice were “more likely to have a higher intake of total sugar than those who drank artificially sweetened drinks,” according to the statement.“Our study’s findings cannot definitively conclude that one beverage poses more health risk than another due to the complexity of our diets and because some people may drink more than one type of beverage,” said lead study author Dr. Ningjian Wang, a professor at the Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in Shanghai, China.“However, based on these findings, we recommend that people reduce or even avoid artificially sweetened and sugar-sweetened beverages whenever possible,” Wang said in the statement. “Do not take it for granted that drinking low-sugar and low-calorie artificially sweetened beverages is healthy, it may pose potential health risks.”"

        "title": "Cold water immersion benefits are not backed by quality science, report says",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "A systematic review of scientific studies on the Wim Hof method of cold water therapy found the quality of the research inadequate to support most claims of effectiveness without addition investigation.Wim Hof, a Dutch extreme athlete and motivational speaker, is well-known for his ability to withstand the cold.“It must be noted that the quality of the studies is very low, meaning that all the results must be interpreted with caution,” according to the analysis published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One.Hof attributes his success to his training method, which focuses on a commitment to practicing cold water therapy with a specific form of breathing. The training reduces stress, improves sleep, bolsters the immune system, and increases energy, focus and willpower, according to Hof.While some research did hint at “promising” anti-inflammatory effects from a combination of cold water immersion and the Wim Hof method of breathing, “more research of higher quality” would be needed to verify that finding, the researchers noted.“As revealed by the review, the science is too weak/biased to conclude what the Wim Hof method achieves,” said cold water survival expert Mike Tipton, professor of human and applied physiology at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom, in an email. He was not involved in the study.Known as “The Iceman,” Hof has swum under ice for 66 meters (72 yards), run a half-marathon barefoot in the snow and climbed Mount Everest without a shirt on. According to the Guinness World Records Hall of Fame, Hof has earned 18 Guinness World Records titles, often beating his own records to do so.Other health benefits listed on Hof’s website, which have not undergone scientific validation in large, clinical trials, include increasing sports performance, reducing recovery time after workouts, improving blood pressure, providing pain relief, boosting the body’s metabolism, overcoming multiple sclerosis, and providing relief from arthritis, asthma, autoimmune disease, fibromyalgia and post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome.The review examined eight randomized clinical trials — considered the gold standard of research — but found the small sample size ranging from 13 to 40 mostly male participants in each study hindered the ability to generalize the results to other populations.In addition, Tipton said, studies in the review did not compare the impact of ice water with any other physical activity such as indoor swimming, yoga or walking.“We have no idea what, if any, ‘active ingredient’ is in the Wim Hof method. We have no idea if any benefits arising from the Wim Hof method could not be obtained more safely by other means,” Tifton said. “I do not agree that anyone can do things like cold water immersion.”Submerging the body in cold water is not advised for a range of medical conditions, Tipton said. Those include asthma, high blood pressure, cardiac rhythm disturbances or any heart disease, unstable diabetes, seizure disorders such as epilepsy, and a family history of sudden or unexplained cardiac death.“We acknowledge the need for more high-quality research to substantiate the Wim Hof Method’s promising effects,” a spokesperson for Hof told CNN via email. “It’s our ongoing commitment to collaborate with the scientific community to conduct larger, more inclusive studies that address these concerns.”Cold water drains heat from the body up to four times faster than cold air, according to the National Weather Service. “When your body hits cold water, ‘cold shock’ can cause dramatic changes in breathing, heart rate and blood pressure,” the service’s website says. “The sudden gasp and rapid breathing alone (create) a greater risk of drowning even for confident swimmers in calm waters.”Yet the popularity of cold water therapy has exploded, with many people immersing themselves in home-based ice baths and cold showers as well as open water swims and dips, Tipton said.“Wim Hof is encouraging people to get more physical which, at a time of increasing illness associated with a sedentary lifestyle, is a good thing, provided it is done safely,” Tipton said.For anyone wanting to give the method a try, Tipton published a list of tips in September 2022 on how to do so safely.First, get a thorough medical checkup.“A recent study suggests that up to 43% of drownings are associated with pre-existing medical conditions,” Tipton said. “Pharmaceutical therapies, both acute and chronic, can alter an individual’s response to CWI (cold water immersion) and their perception of cold.”Only swim on a beach with lifeguards and others, he noted, and be sure to check the forecast to avoid dangers such as rip currents. Wear a visible hat, take a tow float and consider a thermal wet suit for buoyancy.Acclimate to the water by starting the process in warmer weather. As the water becomes colder, enter slowly, allowing the shock to dissipate before submerging your body. Avoid holding your breath; don’t stay in colder water longer than 10 minutes; and don’t rely on how you feel, as that can be “dangerously unreliable,” Tipton said. If you get into trouble, float on your back.Once you exit the water, dry and dress quickly in warm clothing with a windproof outer layer and avoid driving a car for at least 30 minutes after the swim."

        "title": "Marriage rates are up, and divorce rates are down, new data shows",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "After Covid-19 lockdowns, 2022 was a year of marriages, according to new data.The number of marriages took a dive around the start of the pandemic, numbers show. For the past two decades, the number of marriages stayed around 7 to 8 per 1,000 people a year, according to new data released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics.But in 2020, the marriage rate was down to 5.1 per 1,000 people, the data showed. The rate started to climb the next year, and by 2022, the number of marriages had reached 6.2 per capita and over 2 million in a year, according to the report.Growth in marriage rates may be due to more than just rescheduling, said Marissa Nelson, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Washington, DC.Being in lockdown together gave many couples a unique hurdle to overcome, one that made them get intentional about how they approached important things like finances, compromise and autonomy. Many people walked out of that experience with a better sense of what they need in a life partner, Nelson said.Intentionality may also be behind declining divorce rates, she added.In 2022, the divorce rate was 2.4 per 1,000 people. Although that isn’t the lowest it has ever been – in 2021, it was 2.3 – it continues a downward trend, according to the data.By comparison, the rate of divorces in 2000 was 4 per 1,000, which means the current rate is a big decline from two decades earlier.Being stuck in a home together during lockdown forced a lot of couples to face problems in their relationship head-on, Nelson said. That might have caused additional strife, or it could have helped them lay better groundwork for a stable future, she added.Changes over the past two decades may also have helped. Therapy has become more normalized, roles in marriages have become more flexible, and people are more used to talking openly about how they want their marriages to work, Nelson said.Another big change recently has been the way people enter marriages, said Ian Kerner, a licensed marriage and family therapist and CNN contributor.“In my practice over the last decade, I’ve noticed a gradual shift from the ‘romantic marriage’ to the ‘companionate marriage,’ meaning that people are increasingly choosing spouses at the outset who are more like best friends than passion-partners,” Kerner said via email.Doing so may lead to problems with attraction, but it also means those people are choosing partners based on qualities likely to promote long-term stability and satisfaction, he said in a previous CNN article.“At its bare minimum, the concept of commitment implies the experience of being bonded with another. At its very best, it means being bonded with someone who is a consistent safe and secure home base that will be there for you in the face of any adversities,” said Dr. Monica O’Neal, a Boston psychologist, in a recent CNN article."

        "title": "Take caution resuming your fitness routine after Covid, RSV or influenza, experts say",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "You’re finally sticking to your New Year’s resolution to exercise regularly when you become sidelined by Covid-19. Or maybe you’re a seasoned fitness buff training for a marathon, then have to hit pause due to a nasty bout with respiratory syncytial virus or influenza.No matter the scenario, the big question is how to safely reboot your fitness regimen once you have recovered.If you had a simple head cold or 24-hour stomach flu bug, there is not too much to be concerned about. But Covid, RSV and influenza are more serious maladies that require a thoughtful approach to resuming exercise. That’s because the three are viral infections, which tend to cause whole-body inflammation, said Dr. R.J. Turner, a primary care and sports medicine physician with UTHealth Houston.“What that inflammation can do is irritate your heart and lungs, which ultimately can affect your breathing and the way your heart beats,” Turner said. “It takes time for your body to completely recover from a viral infection.”It can take even longer than average to be ready to hit the gym if you’re an older adult or have underlying health concerns, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. And if you already had heart or lung issues, that requires even more caution.Another factor to consider is how long you’ve been ill and inactive. “You start to lose strength in your muscles after five to seven days of inactivity,” said Marisella Villano, a certified personal trainer and owner of Marvil Fit in Hampton Bays, New York.Indeed, your muscles can begin to atrophy within eight hours of surgery. And being bedridden for less than two weeks can result in a 5% to 10% reduction in muscle mass in your quadriceps, according to a 2013 study published in The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology.No matter which virus you had, wait at least five to seven days after recovering before packing your gym bag. You also should be able to do all of your daily activities without excessive fatigue.“Your body, heart and lungs need to recover,” Turner said. “You don’t want to push it too early and then have complications.”If you had Covid accompanied by heart- or lung-related symptoms such as chest pain or difficulty breathing, the American College of Cardiology recommends seeing your physician before resuming exercise. And if Covid caused you to develop myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart, the ACC guidelines say to abstain from exercising for three to six months.Once you’re cleared to resume your workouts, take it slow and easy. Turner recommended calculating your maximum heart rate and keeping it below 70% to start, which is considered light exercise. To determine your maximum heart rate, first subtract your age from 220, then calculate 70% of that. For example, a 40-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 180 beats per minute (220 minus 40). Since 70% of 180 is 126, a 40-year-old’s heart rate should initially stay below 126 beats per minute. You can use a heart-rate monitor or fitness watch to track your heart rate.Villano recommended walking at an easy pace for the first 10 days post-recovery before progressing to more moderate exercise. “But don’t go back to 100% of what you were doing before you became ill,” she said. “Decrease your loads by at least 10% or 15%.”At her fitness studio, some of Villano’s clients tried to jump right back into their workouts after a bout with Covid, despite her warning against it. The result was always the same: The overly eager go-getters fatigued earlier than previously, as their heart rates accelerated at lower workloads than before their illness. Some got lightheaded.“I have to talk them off the ledge and tell them their gains are cumulative,” she said. “Decreasing your workload doesn’t mean you will lose all of your gains.”As you’re slowly working back to your normal fitness routine, pay attention to how you’re feeling. Yes, you’ll likely feel some fatigue as you get back into shape. But if you feel like your heart is racing or beating irregularly, or if you have any chest pain, stop immediately and see your physician.“The biggest thing to be concerned about are heart attacks and developing heart arrhythmias,” Turner said.Being well-hydrated and consuming nutritious foods are also crucial, Turner said, both while you’re ill and when you’re returning to activity. That’s because your body needs energy to fight off the infection while you’re sick and later to fuel your workouts.Should you become frustrated or down about how long it’s taking to get back in shape, remember this: Those who are physically active are less likely to become ill, and if they do catch an infection, it’s typically less severe than for someone who is a couch potato.“At the end of the day, the healthier we are, the better outcomes we have if we do get sick,” Turner said.Melanie Radzicki McManus is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness."

        "title": "This risk assessment tool helped Olivia Munn discover her breast cancer",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "A tool that’s available as an online calculator played a key role in actress Olivia Munn’s discovery that she had breast cancer – even after she had “a normal mammogram,” according to a social media post.The “X-Men: Apocalypse” star, 43, wrote in an Instagram post Wednesday that she was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and would not have discovered it if her physician, Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi, had not calculated her breast cancer risk score.Using that assessment, Aliabadi discovered that Munn’s lifetime risk for breast cancer was 37%. Because of that score, Munn had additional evaluations, leading to her diagnosis, according to her post.A breast cancer risk assessment tool uses a statistical model to estimate a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer over the next five years as well as over her lifetime, or up to about age 90, according to the National Cancer Institute.The tool typically involves several questions about the person’s medical history, reproductive history and family history. Although it’s usually used by health professionals, patients can also complete the assessment online.Two models are commonly used as breast cancer risk assessment tools: the Gail Model and the Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Assessment Calculator. An online version of the breast cancer risk assessment tool, using the Gail Model, is available for anyone to take at bcrisktool.cancer.gov. It reveals the patient’s estimated five-year risk and lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, alongside the average risk for women in the United States of her age and race.“Although a woman’s risk may be accurately estimated, these predictions do not allow one to say precisely which woman will develop breast cancer. In fact, some women who do not develop breast cancer have higher risk estimates than some women who do develop breast cancer,” according to the National Cancer Institute’s website.A family history of breast cancer or other cancers is usually why a physician might conduct a breast cancer risk assessment for their patient, and that is pretty common for a doctor to do, said Dr. Jennifer Plichta, director of the Breast Risk Assessment Clinic at the Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, North Carolina.“I personally think every woman should know what their risk of breast cancer is. I don’t care if you think you’re low risk or high risk. I think it’s worth at least one discussion. Generally, a lot of the organizations are actually saying that conversations should start around the age of 25,” Plichta said.“When your doctor asks you a bunch of questions and it seems like they’re being nosy, they’re actually probably doing some kind of informal risk assessment in their head,” she said. “Then, you might take that next step of doing what we call a formal risk assessment, and you start using a mathematical model that has been developed to determine a woman’s risk.”If someone conducts their own risk assessment online, they should discuss their results with their doctor, Plichta said.“Anybody who does one of these risk assessments online should probably then follow it up with a conversation with their provider, just to make sure that they’re understanding the meaning of what they found out and to make sure that they did it correctly,” Plichta said.“There are definitely times where I’ve had patients who we thought might be high risk, and I ran a little bit more of a nuanced or detailed risk assessment, and they weren’t. And I’ve also had the opposite happen,” she said. “So I think the online tools are great for initiating a discussion. Some of these online models are a little bit generic. They’re helpful, they definitely have a role, and it’s a good place to start – but I don’t think I would end the conversation there.”A breast cancer risk assessment tool typically asks for a patient’s age, the age of their first menstrual period, whether they’ve had a breast biopsy, the age at which they may have had a full-term pregnancy and their family history of breast cancer, among other factors, Dr. Otis Brawley, a professor of oncology and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, said in an email Wednesday.All of those factors are entered into an algorithm that calculates the risk score. Some people may score high even if they don’t have known gene mutations associated with increased breast cancer risk.“It is a way of figuring out who is high risk and who is normal or low risk,” Brawley said, adding that the average risk for a woman in her 40s is typically 0.9% for five years and about 12% for her lifetime.“It has some caveats, such as it may underestimate risk in Black women with previous biopsies and Hispanic women born outside the US,” Brawley said of the assessment tools.“I prefer women do this with a doc or genetic counselor who knows the drawbacks,” he said. “The tool is useful but can make a woman worry her risk is greater than it really is or give false assurance that someone is low risk.”Someone who scores high on a breast cancer risk assessment might be recommended for additional evaluations of the breast besides a typical mammogram, an X-ray picture of the breast.In Munn’s case, she was sent to get an MRI or magnetic resonance imaging of the breast, which led to an ultrasound and then to a biopsy, she wrote in her Instagram post.“The reason that a person could have an MRI would be because they’re calculated to have a higher risk of breast cancer on the basis of the mathematical model,” said Dr. Larry Norton, a breast oncologist and medical director of the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.Mammograms evaluate two things, he said: the density of the breast tissue and calcifications in the breast, which are calcium deposits within breast tissue.However, “MRIs look for blood vessels, because one of the things that cancers do when they become cancerous is, they develop abnormal blood vessels,” Norton said.“So MRIs supplement mammograms. They don’t replace mammograms in most people,” he said. “In many high-risk individuals now, we do both mammograms and we do MRIs.”For some women, a breast risk assessment tool may not be as accurate or appropriate, Robert Smith, senior vice president of early cancer detection science for the American Cancer Society, said in an email Wednesday.“A woman should note disclaimers about the use of the tool in women with a history of breast cancer, or who is a mutation carrier of a breast cancer susceptibility gene. If a woman has a history of multiple first and or second-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer, this tool is not appropriate for them,” he wrote.“For a woman at higher risk due to her family history, there are tools that are tailored for her circumstance,” he said. “Most women fall into a range of risk that is average, and the tool would not suggest that they should be screened any differently than currently recommended.”In a draft recommendation last year, the US Preventive Services Task Force proposed that all women at average risk of breast cancer start screening with mammograms at age 40 to reduce their risk of dying from the disease.The USPSTF is a group of independent medical experts whose recommendations help guide doctors’ decisions and influence insurance plans, and that draft recommendation aligns with what some groups, such as the American Cancer Society, have been recommending: for average-risk women to start mammograms in their 40s.The American Cancer Society recommends that women who are at high risk of breast cancer based on certain factors get a breast MRI and a mammogram every year, typically starting at age 30.Having access to a breast cancer risk assessment tool empowers patients, Dr. Ruth Oratz, a breast medical oncologist at NYU Langone Health’s Perlmutter Cancer Center and clinical professor of medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, said in an email Wednesday.“Having information empowers patients. It is very important for people to be aware of their health risks, their family history, and their own personal medical conditions. All of these things can affect the risk of developing cancer,” she said.“Depending on level of risk, and the factors that contribute to that risk, women can take steps to help lower the possibility of developing breast cancer. It is important to have a healthy body weight and not be overweight. It is important to eat a healthy diet that is not overloaded with sugar and fat. Alcohol is a significant risk factor for breast cancer and we recommend that women do not drink alcohol every day and have no more than one or two drinks on the days that they do drink,” Oratz said.“We certainly recommend that people do not smoke. Remaining physically fit with exercise and some weight training to maintain muscle mass and strength also contributes to general overall health,” she said. “Sometimes medications are given to help reduce the risk of breast cancer. Each individual needs to discuss this with a breast cancer expert.”"

        "title": "What to know about puberty blockers",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "As England’s National Health Service has decided to stop prescribing puberty blockers to minors with gender dysphoria or gender incongruence, many people are asking what those are and why they’re such a hot-button issue.“Puberty blockers are sort of like a man-made hormone analogue, and basically what they do is fool the brain into not sending messages to the ovaries and testes to secrete hormones,” said Dr. Michelle Forcier, a professor of pediatrics at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University in Rhode Island, who has specialized in gender, sexual and reproductive health for 25 years.“The brain thinks it’s got enough hormones and doesn’t message the ovaries and testes to get to work,” added Forcier, also a clinician at Folx Health. “And so, the ovaries and testes kind of just rest or go to sleep until the brain gland wakes up again and tells them, ‘Time to secrete hormones.’”Pausing puberty for people assigned male at birth, the medications can temporarily prevent shoulders broadening, voices deepening, facial hair growing or the testes or penis enlarging, Forcier said. For those assigned female at birth, puberty blockers pause the development of breasts, wider hips or a menstrual period.This state of limbo gives adolescents time to think about their gender identity and their guardians time to consider options before their bodies begin changing in ways that can “create massive dysphoria, depression, suicidality and a whole bunch of other poor health outcomes,” Forcier said.The blockers “prevent permanent changes that we can’t necessarily fix or eradicate in the future,” she added. “We can’t go backwards, but at least everything (pauses) where it is.”In the United States, at least 121,882 children ages 6 to 17 were diagnosed with gender dysphoria from 2017 to 2021, with the rate increasing 70% from 2020 to 2021, according to data collected by Reuters and health technology company Komodo Health. Just 17,600 children from that total population started taking puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones within that five-year period. Of those children, 27% were on puberty blockers.But changing the accessibility of these medications worldwide — including in at least 22 US states — is the fact that “gender-affirming medical care has become a highly politicized issue,” said Dr. Melina Wald, a clinical psychologist at her private practice Bespoke Health in Connecticut and New York state, via email. Wald cofounded Columbia University Medical Center’s Gender and Sexuality Program.Here’s what else you should know about puberty blockers and, if you’re a parent, whether they’re something your child needs.If your kid expresses that they’re transgender or another diverse gender identity, you need to discuss with them what their identity and expression means to them, Forcier said.Not every gender diverse child feels the need for puberty blockers, said Dr. Lauren Wilson, a pediatric hospitalist and president of the Montana chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, via email.But “if a kid is freaking out about puberty or has huge behavioral, emotional or social changes before or with the changes of puberty, that’s a key to check in,” Forcier said. This distress is a main factor in whether they qualify for access, she said. Parents should ask them if there’s anything they’re nervous or excited about, or if they would like to speak with a professional.“Ideally, parents who are considering puberty blockers for their child are working with qualified mental health professionals with significant experience in counseling families around the decision to use puberty blockers,” said Wald, who’s also on voluntary faculty at Columbia University as an assistant professor of medical psychology. “The decision is not one that is ever made lightly, and often occurs in the context of years of a relationship between a child, parents/caregivers and their doctors.”These days puberty has been starting earlier, beginning in most kids around ages 8 or 10, Forcier said.“Many kids have already completed puberty by the age of 13 or 14 … so we start blockers when puberty starts,” Forcier said. “We stop blockers when it’s appropriate or we add gender hormones to blockers when it’s appropriate.”While puberty blockers pause puberty, gender-affirming hormones for older teens and adults help them hormonally mature into the bodily features associated with their gender identity — such as facial hair using testosterone, or a softer voice using estrogen. The appropriate time to begin could be when a kid is ready later in adolescence, when the family’s ready, or when the kid witnesses peers going through puberty, Forcier added.Taking puberty blockers could also prevent the need for future gender-affirming surgeries, Forcier said — such as if a child assigned female at birth takes blockers, preventing the growth of breasts. That child could later transition to testosterone and never develop breasts.“Everybody’s bodies are different, and that’s why government shouldn’t be making decisions about individual bodies,” Forcier said, “because there is not one right way to do things. The one right way to do things is to listen to the patient.”The NHS decision, condemned by many LGBTQ groups and some medical professionals, is based on its conclusion that after considering an evidence review it commissioned in 2020 and other information published since then, there isn’t “enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness” of puberty-suppressing hormones.However, transgender adolescents have been using blockers for three decades, Wilson said.They have also been used since the 1980s to treat children for whom puberty starts at an unusually early age to allow puberty to begin later. The blockers have been proven to be highly safe and effective, Wilson and Wald said.“In adults, they can (also) be used to treat prostate cancer, endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome, among other things,” Wilson said.“The use of puberty blockers in any child or adolescent is associated with a risk of decrease in bone density, because bone mineralization increases with puberty hormones,” Wilson said. “But when the medication is stopped and puberty resumes or other hormone treatments are started, bone mineralization normalizes.”Another reason not to be alarmed about the bone risk is that for any human there are multiple factors that play into bone loss or osteoporosis later in life, such as genetics, health conditions and lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise, Forcier said.The lack of bone accretion in adolescent years due to medication is important to think about, she added, but so are the potential harms of going without puberty blockers and living in a body at odds with one’s gender.There’s also the risk of infertility if children go straight from puberty blockers to hormone therapy, experts said.Some people worry that children who take puberty blockers may change their minds about their gender identity later in life. But several studies have shown that most people who opt for gender-affirming care don’t later regret their choices — including an October 2022 study in Amsterdam, Netherlands, that found 98% of transgender youth who had started gender-affirming medical treatment in adolescence continued to use those hormones around five or six years later in adulthood.“I meet with some of the older folks that have thought about gender, and they knew they had the same feelings at these younger ages,” Forcier said, challenging the notion that kids don’t know themselves. “They just didn’t have a means to do anything about it, or they were so scared or discouraged.”There are ongoing, long-term studies of puberty blockers for transgender youth, Wilson said.“Medications always have risks and benefits,” she added, “and good decision-making is based on accurate information and the needs of the child, first and foremost.”"

        "title": "Ancient lord’s tomb found filled with gold and multiple sacrificial bodies",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Excavations of an archaeological site in Panama have revealed the grave of a religious leader buried over 1,200 years ago alongside a cache of gold objects — and numerous other human remains.Researchers found the ancient tomb in El Caño Archaeological Park, a site in Coclé province known as a hotbed for pre-Columbian discoveries, particularly lavish burial chambers. The newfound enclosure, built around 700, is the ninth tomb unearthed from the park since excavation of the site began in 2008, according to a March 1 news release from Panama’s Ministry of Culture.The tombs, including the latest to be uncovered, are resting places for people who had a higher status within their societies, said Dr. Julia Mayo, the excavation’s leader and the director of the El Caño Foundation, a group that studies Panama’s cultural heritage through research on the archaeological site. The research team believe the person found lying at the center of the grave had higher status, indicated not only by his physical position but also gold and ceramic artifacts that surrounded the body.The civilization of the region surrounding El Caño at the time treated the site as sacred and worshipped their “ancestors,” referring to those remembered for having done important things. “After the death of these people, (it was believed that) a constant communication was established between the ancestor and his descendants,” Mayo said. “Our study (of the tombs) highlights the practice of ritual death in funerary rituals linked to (a higher) status.”The newly uncovered elite leader was likely a 30- or 40-year-old man, dubbed “Lord of the Flutes” by the archaeologists because he was entombed alongside a set of animal bone flutes that were likely used for religious ceremonies , she added.And as researchers continued to explore the grave, they realized the Lord of the Flutes might have had quite a bit of company on his journey to the afterlife — potentially up to a few dozen companions whose remains were found buried beneath the offerings that surrounded him.The researchers found similar patterns among the tomb and the eight previously studied tombs that suggested the other bodies belonged to people sacrificed to accompany the dead to the afterlife, Mayo said. It appears the newly discovered remains were all buried at the same time and also had signs of a ritual death, she added.El Caño is divided into two sectors of burial chambers: a high-status sector that holds burial chambers with multiple bodies, and a low-status sector where graves include only one body per grave, Mayo said. Excavation is not complete, so it’s unclear how many bodies are within the newly discovered grave, but the other eight tombs have revealed anywhere from eight to 32 bodies.While the other tombs held what researchers believe to be military leaders, the Lord of the Flutes was likely more of a religious leader, as the body was “buried with flutes and bells and not, as in the case of other lords found at the same site, with axes, spears and objects made with teeth of large predators. This calls attention to the importance of religion in this society,” Mayo said in an email.The excavation of the ninth tomb is expected to be complete by this time next year.The archaeologists found the body of the supposed religious leader buried face down and on top of the body of a woman, the release stated. The relationship the man might have had with the woman is unknown, Mayo said.“The face-down mode of burial was common at this time period in this region, but the positioning of the male over the female individual is not,” said Nicole Smith-Guzmán, the archaeology curator with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama City, via email.However, she added other researchers reported the discovery of human remains dating back more than 1,000 years buried in similar positioning at a nearby site called Sitio Sierra, in the same province as El Caño. The researchers at the time speculated that the pair represented a husband and wife, but the theory remains unconfirmed.“Nevertheless, it is likely that there was some sort of social relationship between the two individuals during life that was important to maintain in death,” said Smith-Guzmán, who was not a part of either discovery.Among the artifacts found scattered on top of the burial chamber and surrounding the Lord of the Flutes were five pectorals — a form of breastplate jewelry for the deceased — two belts made of gold beads, several gold bracelets and necklaces, as well as two earrings in the form of human figures, and a few pieces of jewelry made from animal teeth, including earrings made from the teeth of a sperm whale, according to the release.These “exotic” materials were usually interpreted as the leader’s strategies in life for getting more prestige within their territories, said Ana María Navas Méndez, an assistant professor of sociology and anthropology at Illinois State University, in an email. The ancient chiefs of Latin America would often establish political and economic relationships with leaders of nearby communities, allowing precious and artisan goods to be swapped with one another, she added.Several of the artifacts found within the tomb were “stylistically similar to those produced in the Quimbaya region (of Colombia),” Mayo said, adding that this indicates there was a great deal of interaction and exchange of materials “between the populations that inhabited the central region of Panama and the north of South America.”Experts believe El Caño functioned as a regional ceremonial center or necropolis (city of the dead) for elite members of society, Smith-Gúzman said.There have been two attempts — the most recent in 2021 — to figure out whom the various tombs found at the El Caño site once belonged to, Mayo said. But each attempt failed to pick up any DNA from the human bones, most likely because the region’s hot and humid climate is not ideal for preservation, she added.“(This discovery) offers new evidence to continue studying the chiefdoms in Panama that could be compared with previous findings,” Navas Méndez said. “With this new evidence, archaeologists could ask new questions about the interactions between chiefdoms, about the political economy of pre-Columbian societies, about religious aspects, about gender, and so on.”"

        "title": "What to do on the nights you are struggling with insomnia, according to experts",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "With an early meeting in the morning, I had done everything I could think to do to get through my latest bout of insomnia and go to sleep.I had exercised, eaten an early dinner, given myself time to wind down, read a few chapters until I felt drowsy, and softly closed my eyes.When I woke up in the middle of the night, it was as if someone opened a web browser I had forgotten that I minimized, and all the tabs started reloading. What if it rains when I get married next year? Did I annoy my friend when I asked for pet-sitting help? I should really do a better job of keeping in touch with extended family. Am I taking too much time off? Not enough?Before I knew it, I was buzzing. I did get some sleep, eventually, but it was constantly interrupted by my tossing and turning. Once the first rays of sunlight came through my bedroom window, I had given up.I am one of the 1 in 10 people who have chronic insomnia, said Dr. Shalini Paruthi, codirector of the Sleep Medicine and Research Center at St. Luke’s Hospital in Chesterfield, Missouri, and American Academy of Sleep Medicine spokesperson.Chronic insomnia is when a person takes more than 30 minutes to fall asleep or fall back asleep up to three times a week for more than three months — which, as a result, impacts their day with symptoms such as concentration problems or changes in mood, said Dr. Rachel Salas, professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.There are several useful methods to treat the condition, including fixing your sleep hygiene and engaging in cognitive behavioral therapy specifically for insomnia. But those take weeks to take effect.What do you do on those nights where you just know sleep isn’t coming — or, at least, not without a fight?The first step is to identify where the insomnia is coming from, said Paruthi, who is also an adjunct professor at Saint Louis University School of Medicine.Sometimes insomnia can come on with big life changes, such as grieving a loved one or a experiencing a medical event, she added. Often, insomnia can go hand in hand with stress, anxiety and depression.But that doesn’t mean that the condition doesn’t deserve treatment or will just go away when the grief, stress or illness does, Paruthi said.“Insomnia is a real disorder,” she said. “You have to treat both in order to get that person back to their full mental health.”It’s also possible for insomnia to be caused by restless leg syndrome. The condition affects a lot of people, but is often underestimated as a cause of insomnia, Paruthi said.A feeling of restlessness and an urge to move in your arms, legs or torso is a state of hyperarousal and can keep you from a good night’s sleep, she said.Many people go undiagnosed because they don’t have the words to describe what is happening to them, and it can be a missed because it isn’t always just the legs that are affected, she add.If that is the case, she recommends getting up, walking around the house and doing some stretches to ease the restless feeling before trying again to get to sleep.Don’t let bed become a place associated with long stretches of stressing to get to sleep, said Salas, who is also a sleep neurologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Sleep and Wellness.“The worst thing somebody with insomnia could do is stay in bed and not sleep,” she said.If you worry, check your phone or watch TV in bed, the brain gets conflicting messages about what your bed is for, Salas said.Instead, try to do your normal pre-bedtime routine, and then get into bed at your bedtime and give yourself roughly 15 to 20 minutes to fall asleep — don’t look at the clock, just estimate, Salas said.If you haven’t fallen asleep by that time, use a flashlight that isn’t your phone to go into another room and try another activity until you start to feel drowsy and try again, she added.Does that mean if you aren’t drowsy at the bedtime you have set for yourself, you shouldn’t get into bed at that time? Salas said no.“Most people are quick to be like, ‘Well, I’m not sleeping. I’m just going to stay awake, and I’ll go to bed when I’m tired,’” she said. “But now you’re dealing with the variability of a bedtime and awakening time. And we know from studies that people that even if they got 10 hours of sleep, if they’re going to bed at different times and waking up at different times, you can actually function like a sleep-deprived person.”Whatever you do in those times when you get out of bed needs to be relaxing and follow good sleep hygiene, Paruthi said.Salas recommends that her patients listen to classical music or nature sounds to help their brain make the association with sleep. Or you can read a book that isn’t terribly interesting or magazines with short articles by flashlight, she added.That is not the time to do that load of laundry or start checking work emails, Salas said. Remember, it’s all about teaching your brain that it’s time to wind down.If you are trying all the recommended practices but still having a hard time, there are effective over-the-counter or prescription medications that you can talk to your doctor about to get you through particularly difficult nights, Paruthi said.If you find yourself getting seven to nine hours of sleep and still feeling tired during the day, there could be an underlying sleep disorder you need to treat, Salas said.“That’s the worst thing because we know sleep is definitely important not only for memory, cognition, but for immunities, all sorts of other things,” she said. “I would say that if you notice that you feel like you’re getting enough sleep but you’re still tired and dragging and having problems during the day, it’s time to talk to your doctor.”"

        "title": "Despite symptoms, NIH research finds no evidence of ‘Havana syndrome’ in brain scans",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Researchers with the National Institutes of Health published a pair of studies on Monday that found few clinical differences between patients with a mysterious ailment known as “Havana syndrome” and healthy comparison groups.In one study, NIH researchers took a closer look at the brains of people who were believed to have Havana syndrome and found no consistent evidence of brain injury and no significant differences between that group and a healthy comparison group.In the second study, scientists ran a battery of tests on 86 US government staff and family members who reported Havana syndrome, comparing them with 30 people who had similar jobs but had no such symptoms, and found that by most clinical and biomarker measures, the two groups were the same.The mysterious illness first emerged in late 2016, when a cluster of diplomats stationed in the Cuban capital of Havana began reporting symptoms consistent with head trauma, including dizziness and extreme headaches. In subsequent years, there have been cases reported around the world, including clusters of at least 60 incidents in Bogota, Colombia, and Vienna, Austria. There have been about 1,500 reported cases across the US government in 96 different counties, officials said last year, but the number of reported incidents has dropped significantly in recent years.Despite longstanding speculation that the illness could have been the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US, the US intelligence community said last year that it cannot link any cases to a foreign adversary, ruling it unlikely that the unexplained illness was the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US.But the illness — and its cause — have remained frustratingly opaque to both the intelligence community and the medical community.Dr. David Relman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford who worked on earlier investigations of people with Havana syndrome, argued in an editorial published alongside the research Monday that while the study involving brain scans may appear to show that “nothing, or nothing serious” happened with these cases, coming to this conclusion “would be ill-advised.”Earlier work found evidence of abnormalities, he said, and the same is true for the study that did a wider variety of tests. Because the condition can look different in each person, he said, doctors don’t have specific tests that can fully determine what is wrong with them.“Clearly, new, sensitive, standardized, non-invasive tests of nervous system function, especially involving the vestibular system, are needed, such as more specific blood markers of different forms of cellular injury,” Relman wrote.One problem facing the medical community is that there is still not a clear definition of Havana syndrome — or what the government terms “anomalous health incidents” or AHIs. These tests were done, in some cases, long after symptoms began, making it harder to understand what physically happened.In 2022, an intelligence panel investigating the cause of AHIs said that some of the episodes could “plausibly” have been caused by “pulsed electromagnetic energy” emitted by an external source.But Relman noted that there is a relative lack of information about the biological effects of electromagnetic and acoustic energy on the brain, even if this is what actually triggered the problems in people with Havana syndrome.Some current and former CIA officers have raised concerns that a CIA task force in charge of investigating Havana syndrome soft-pedaled its investigation, CNN has previously reported.And some patients and former officials have said they were treated with skepticism and in some cases outright dismissal by the Trump administration in the months and years following the appearance of the first cases.Despite the uncertainty surrounding the condition, Congress in 2021 passed legislation mandating compensation for CIA and government victims, which the agency began disbursing in 2022.Relman noted that as with any kind of highly publicized clinical syndromes, such as Gulf War syndrome and now Havana syndrome, it is difficult for scientists to deal with “uncertainty, complexity, the need for transdisciplinary approaches, insufficient information or misinformation, and a topic that is politically charged and divisive.”“Going forward, we must address the underlying institutional failures and vulnerabilities that contributed to these outcomes,” Relman writes. He argued for surveillance systems designed to detect early cases across government agencies and objective independent panels to review emerging data.“Prejudice and poorly supported assumptions must be set aside,” he wrote.The neuroimaging study compared the brains of 81 people thought to have Havana syndrome and those of 48 people who had no such health complaints. Twenty-nine members of the comparison group had similar employment as the 81 in the patient group.To look for differences in the participants’ brains, the scientists used imaging known as high-quality diffusion MRI, which doctors typically use to check for conditions such as a stroke, a brain tumor, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. This kind of MRI can visualize white matter fibers in the brain and determine whether the brain matter is normal or if there are problems.When the researchers compared the two groups, they found no significant differences in the structures and measurements of the brains.“These findings suggest that the origin of the symptoms of participants with AHIs may not be linked to an MRI-identifiable injury to the brain,” the study concluded.There are limitations to this research, however. The control group was small and not perfectly matched to those with Havana syndrome. The earliest scans were also conducted within 14 days after the person said they experienced the event that triggered their symptoms, and the results may have been different if done at a different time.The study results differ from previous imaging studies that found evidence of some brain abnormalities, but past studies were done on smaller number of participants.In the second study, researchers tested hearing, balance, eyesight and neuropsychological state, and they looked at blood biomarkers, in the two groups.There were no significant clinical differences between the two groups when it came to their hearing or vision, nor were there differences when the researchers tested the inner ear or checked the blood for certain biomarkers. Cognitive tests were also similar.There were some differences in self-reported symptoms, however, including fatigue, depression, post-traumatic stress, imbalance and some neurobehavioral issues.Headache was a common concern among the participants with Havana syndrome. Most developed daily persistent headaches, the study said, but only eight were diagnosed with new-onset migraines.“While we did not identify significant differences in participants with AHIs, it’s important to acknowledge that these symptoms are very real, cause significant disruption in the lives of those affected and can be quite prolonged, disabling and difficult to treat,” Dr. Leighton Chan, lead author on one of the papers and acting chief scientific officer of the NIH Clinical Center, said in a news release.The authors of the study noted several limitations to their research, including the fact that some of the assessments, though sensitive, are not specific, and some are not used clinically, so it is unclear exactly how impactful they are.There were also no psychiatric evaluations performed. Anxiety, depression pain and fatigue can affect balance, hearing and cognitive testing, so abnormalities can be difficult to interpret.The study concluded that whatever caused Havana syndrome seems to create symptoms “without persistent or detectable physiologic changes. A lack of evidence for a brain injury does not necessarily mean that no injury is present or that it did not occur at the time of the AHI.”“Alternatively, the ‘attack’s’ physiological effects might be so varied and idiosyncratic that they cannot be identified with the current methodologies and sample size,” the study said."

        "title": "Some people are genetically predisposed to gain weight. These 5 tips can help",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Editor’s note: Season 9 of the podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the intersection between body weight and health. We delve into a wide range of topics, including the science behind new weight loss drugs, weight gain around menopause, and the evolutionary reasons behind why losing weight is so hard. You can listen here.(CNN) — When the American Medical Association voted to recognize obesity as a disease in 2013, the largest professional group of doctors paved the way for the condition to finally be taken seriously.At the time, and even now, much controversy surrounded the decision. But slowly the needle is moving, from the assumption that obesity is the fault of those who have it (they are lazy and have no willpower) to it being a chronic condition that puts health at risk and may need long-term medical management. Still, many people, including those in the fat acceptance movement, do not believe their bodies should be pathologized.By now, the statistics are familiar: Around 42% of adult Americans are obese, according to the latest numbers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and another 31% are overweight. And the health conditions linked to obesity — high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease and stroke, to name a few — are well-documented.But what exactly makes obesity a disease, and are all people who carry extra weight unhealthy?“One of the important things we’ve learned is that obesity is a brain condition, for lack of a better term,” Giles Yeo, a world-renowned geneticist at the University of Cambridge and a pioneer in the field of obesity research, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on the podcast Chasing Life recently.“It is now clear — crystal clear, unequivocal — that (obesity) is a brain problem: It is a problem of our brain influencing the hunger,” Yeo said. “So, hunger is a brain scenario, even though the feeling of hunger comes from your stomach. And we now know that obesity is just your brain influencing what you eat and how you eat.”While carrying extra pounds can lead to many inconveniences (such as arthritis and sleep apnea), Yeo said it alone won’t kill you. But it is dangerous to carry too much extra fat because once your fat cells fill up — Yeo calls them “professional fat-storing organs” — then the fat spills over into other parts of the body, such as internal organs and muscles, that are not designed to store fat. And that is when metabolic problems begin to take root, which can eventually lead to conditions such as cardiovascular disease.However, not every person with extra weight is necessarily living with a disease, Yeo said.“If you redefine the term obesity — I am maybe doing some verbal gymnastics here, but I think it is an important nuance — the moment we begin to understand that obesity is not high body weight, but (rather) obesity is a state where high body weight begins to influence your health, then it is a disease,” he said.Genetics plays an important role regarding how much fat your fat cells can store, and it also affects how often and how strongly our brain sends out the hunger signal.What can you do if nature has stacked the deck against you? Yeo has these five tips — which he calls “Yeo truths” in his first book, “Gene Eating: The Science of Obesity and the Truth about Dieting” — to help you eat sanely to lose weight.Losing weight goes against our self-preservation mechanisms.“Anyone that tells you that weight loss is easy is lying to you — trust me: lying to you,” Yeo said. “It ain’t easy because your brain makes it not easy. So, when you lose weight, your brain hates it and will try and get you to gain the weight back.”Yeo said if you are having a hard time losing weight, “understand it’s not because you’re bad, it’s because ‘it ain’t supposed to be easy.’”Cut back your food intake across the board — just a little.“Eat a little bit less of everything,” Yeo said, adding that this kind of advice is not going to make him a rich man. “It’s otherwise called moderation, but it’s also true.”He warns against trying to completely cut out often-vilified food groups, such as carbs or fat. “If you can drink dairy, then dairy is not poisonous for you,” he said. “Eat a little bit less of everything, if you … want to lose weight.”Choose foods that stick to the ribs.“Food that takes longer to digest makes you feel fuller,” Yeo said. “It’s true — you know it!”One example is protein. “You don’t want to eat too much of it, but a higher protein diet does make you feel fuller,” he said. “Eating foods with fiber does tend to make you feel fuller as well.”Consider the value of the entire food, not just one aspect of it.“Don’t blindly count calories,” Yeo said. “Why? Because calories tell you about the amount of food; they do not tell you about the nutritional quality of the food. (The calorie count) doesn’t tell you how much protein, how much fiber, how much salt, how much micronutrients (are) in there.”Whenever discussing diets, Yeo said, people talk needlessly about excluding so-called bad foods instead of understanding how they interact with food.“Don’t fear food,” he said. “I think we do have to fix our food environment; I think some people need to eat less food. But if you fear food … you begin to think, ‘Oh, I need to cut this, I need to cut that out.’“I think we need to eat a little bit less food. But I think we need to love our food.”We hope these five tips help you think about food (and eating) in a more productive and less toxic way.

        "title": "Treating ADHD patients with medication linked to lower risk of death overall, study finds",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "People with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for premature death and other adverse health outcomes, but a large study out of Sweden suggests that treating the disorder with medication can help reduce the overall mortality risk for patients.Researchers identified nearly 150,000 Swedish residents between the ages of 6 and 64 who were diagnosed with ADHD sometime between 2007 and 2018 and tracked deaths that occurred within two years of diagnosis.They found that there were 48 deaths for every 10,000 people with ADHD who did not receive medication compared with 39 deaths for every 10,000 people who did receive medication – a 19% decrease in 2-year mortality risk.Experts say that the new report emphasizes the importance of timely ADHD diagnoses and adds important considerations for clinicians to discuss with patients who are deciding how to manage their ADHD. In the United States, it also adds urgency to address the shortage of Adderall and other stimulant drugs used that has been ongoing since October 2022.Millions of people in the US have ADHD. In 2021, about 4% of people ages 5 to 54 had filled a prescription for a stimulant in 2021, according to a federal analysis of private insurance records. And prescriptions for ADHD medications surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, especially among young adults and women.“Undertreating ADHD is not without consequences,” experts from the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University Irving Medical Center wrote in a corresponding editorial about the new study, both of which published Tuesday in the journal JAMA.Treatment with ADHD medication especially reduced the risk of death from “unnatural” causes, including accidental injury, suicide and accidental poisoning such as drug overdose. This was particularly true among men, the study found.People with ADHD have been found to be at higher risk for coexisting mental disorders and neurological conditions such as depression, anxiety, substance misuse or abuse, eating disorders, epilepsy, or conduct or tic disorders.ADHD medication may alleviate “the core symptoms of ADHD and its psychiatric comorbidities, leading to improved impulse control and decision-making, ultimately reducing the occurrence of fatal events, in particular among those due to accidental poisoning,” the study authors wrote.While ADHD medications are relatively short-acting, experts say it’s important to consider the broader outcomes along with the immediate benefits.“When we think about treatment, we think about addressing the negative impacts of the disorder going on right now, but we also want to think about the long-term picture as well,” said John Mitchell, associate professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University School of Medicine. His research focuses on ADHD, but he was not involved in the new study.“We actually might be able to have an impact on mortality when we correctly identify ADHD and when we treat it,” Mitchell said.When it comes to “natural” causes of death such as medical conditions, however, the new study found that medication did not significantly affect mortality among ADHD patients.In some ways, this finding is “reassuring,” especially in light of other recent research that raised concerns about the long-term effects that ADHD medications may have on heart health, the study authors wrote.The new study did not track how well ADHD patients consistently adhered to the medications they were prescribed, and other lifestyle factors and aspects of care that could affect outcomes were not considered. For these reasons, the link identified between treatment with medication and reduced mortality risk cannot be considered a direct cause-and-effect.And while the medications used to treat ADHD in Sweden are also available in the US, “significant barriers exist in accessing medical and psychiatric services, particularly among underresourced populations” in the US health care system, experts wrote in the corresponding editorial.“The health care workforce requires training in screening, diagnosing, and treating ADHD, just as has been done for other psychiatric disorders. Our patients, their families, and society will all benefit as a result.”CNN’s Kristen Rogers contributed to this report."

        "title": "EPA bans last form of asbestos used in United States",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "The US Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that it is taking a “historic” step by banning ongoing uses of asbestos, which has long been linked to multiple types of cancer.The agency’s announcement of the final rule applies to chrysotile asbestos, the only form of asbestos currently being used in or imported to the United States. It is the most common type of asbestos used in the world, used in car parts such as aftermarket automotive brakes and linings and other vehicle friction products and gaskets. It’s been banned in 50 other countries.Asbestos is a thin, fibrous, naturally occurring material that is flexible and resistant to corrosion, electricity and heat. It’s inexpensive, which led manufacturers and builders to use several forms of the material in cigarette filters, hair dryers and home insulation. Manufacturers dialed back the use of asbestos once scientists determined that the fibers could easily separate into tiny particles that could be inhaled into the lungs, causing damage.While the use of asbestos has been declining for decades in the US, asbestos exposure is linked to more than 40,000 deaths in the US, according to the EPA.People who are exposed to asbestos can develop lung cancer, mesothelioma, ovarian cancer and laryngeal cancer, studies show.Calling it a “major milestone” for chemical safety “after more than three decades of inadequate protections and serious delays during the previous administration,” the EPA celebrated the change Monday.“The science is clear – asbestos is a known carcinogen that has severe impacts on public health. President Biden understands that this concern that has spanned generations and impacted the lives of countless people. That’s why EPA is so proud to finalize this long-needed ban on ongoing uses of asbestos,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.The EPA set different deadlines for different industries to transition away from asbestos.For the auto industry, for brakes, linings, other vehicle friction products and gaskets, the ban goes into effect six months after the date of the final rule, which is 60 days after it appears in the Federal Register.The chlor-alkali industry, the main source of chlorine globally, uses asbestos diaphragms to make sodium hydroxide and chlorine, which the EPA says is “critical” to disinfect drinking water and wastewater. The agency said there are other methods to produce chlorine, but the eight plants in the US that still use these asbestos diaphragms will have to find other methods to do their work. They will get at least five more years to make this transition.The American Chemistry Council, a trade association that represents companies that use asbestos products, said in a statement that its Chlorine Panel provided the EPA with data that suggested it needed a 15-year transition timeline to “support an orderly transition and to avoid a significant disruption of chlorine and sodium hydroxide supplies.” The council said it has not seen the final rule.The EPA said it will require strict workplace safety measures to protect workers’ health where there is a phaseout that is longer than two years.The AFL-CIO, the country’s largest labor federation that includes unions, applauded the EPA’s ban for providing “landmark protection” for workers.“This action once more shows the deep commitment of the Biden administration to ensure working people remain safe and healthy on the job,” the federation said in a statement. It added, though, that although it is a critical step forward, Monday’s action does not eliminate all types of asbestos fibers and does not address “legacy” asbestos through the country’s old buildings and infrastructure.“We urge the EPA to move swiftly to address those risks as well,” the AFL-CIO said.The EPA also announced Monday that it is evaluating legacy uses of asbestos and asbestos-containing talc, a super-soft mineral that is often mined alongside asbestos.Monday’s ban is something Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said is a “long overdue step forward for public health.”“However, it cannot be the end of the road when it comes to phrasing out other dangerous asbestos fibers, and Congress has a role to play here when it comes to providing stronger protections for our health,” Merkley said."

        "title": "All eligible people at Chicago migrant shelter have been vaccinated for measles in ‘unprecedented operation’",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "The Chicago Department of Public Health said Wednesday that everyone who is eligible for vaccination at a temporary shelter housing migrants that’s at the center of a measles outbreak has now been vaccinated.The city learned last week that it had its first measles case since 2019. Illinois is one of 17 states that have seen measles cases this year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The first case in this outbreak was unrelated to the shelter.Two more cases of measles in children have been identified by the Chicago Department of Public Health, bringing the total number of cases in the city to 10, according to an update Wednesday.One of the children resides at a migrant shelter in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood, where a measles outbreak has been declared, and attends Cooper Dual Language Academy, a Chicago Public Schools spokesperson said Thursday. The second child lives in a different part of Chicago, health officials said.Earlier this week, the school district said in a statement that a school-age child living at the shelter had measles. That student attended Philip D. Armour Elementary School in the Bridgeport neighborhood, according to the school district.Eight migrants at the crowded shelter – five children and three adults – have tested positive for measles. The virus is highly contagious and can cause serious symptoms that can lead to pneumonia and other potentially life-threatening complications, but it is preventable with vaccination. It can spread through the air and through contaminated surfaces and can be difficult to manage in crowded areas.The temporary shelter was not set up to house as many people as are living in the converted warehouse, according to Alderman Byron Sigcho-Lopez, who represents the area. The shelter was supposed to hold about 1,000 people; there are 1,900 there now.“Right now, we have people that are in close proximity to one another,” Sigcho-Lopez said.Because this outbreak was considered an emergency, Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Olusimbo “Simbo” Ige said Wednesday, the city pulled in all of its medical directors and staff, along with other departments and public health officials, to vaccinate as many people at the shelter as quickly as possible.Staff put in 12- and 16-hour shifts over the weekend in what Dr. Alexander Sloboda, an assistant professor at Rush University’s Department of Emergency Medicine, called an “unprecedented operation” to get a mass vaccination, screening and education effort underway “that’s not really been performed anywhere else in this similar circumstance.”Of the 1,900 people housed at the shelter, about 999 are vaccinated and immune, Ige said Wednesday. The remaining half who are eligible have been recently vaccinated.“One of the success stories here, especially for the measles response, is that of all those who are eligible that were offered vaccines, we had no refusals,” Ige said. “Once we provide people with information and opportunity to ask questions and respond to those questions, most people are willing to accept the vaccines.”Those who have recently been vaccinated are expected to quarantine for the next 21 days, since it takes about that amount of time for the full protection of the vaccine to kick in.The city said people at the shelter who are immune to measles have been given a card that allows them to come and go. Those who are not immune have been given cards to say they need to quarantine at the shelter.Residents of the shelter will be monitored daily for symptoms and will be connected to care if they get sick.Measles is so contagious that if one person gets it, 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people around them will catch the virus. An infected person can spread measles even before they have symptoms, from up to four days before developing a rash and through four days afterward.Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella or MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles if you are exposed to the virus. One dose is 93% effective.The vaccine provides lifelong protection, according to the CDC. Most people in the US get the two-dose series in childhood.Measles had been considered eliminated from the US in 2000, but cases have been popping up across the country as vaccinations have declined and more people are traveling to parts of the world where measles is more common.Dr. Michelle Funk, medical director of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said that it has also been working with the state to move people who are at highest risk of severe illness but are not eligible for vaccination.“In other words, those with very young children, families with pregnant individuals, [were moved] to a special place that they can stay and be separated from the rest of the people at this facility,” Funk said.Nine families have been moved to an off-site location, according to Lucia Calderon, Sigcho-Lopez’s chief of staff. The families have children under 1 or expectant mothers, neither of which can be vaccinated.Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Wednesday that he called the White House to ask for the CDC’s help.“I was the one who called the White House to make sure that the CDC would be coming to Chicago to advise and make sure that the actions that are being taken now are put in place,” he said.The CDC sent a team of experts to the city Tuesday to help with the overall effort and to provide technical guidance when needed.“This is an unprecedented situation,” Ige said. “There are no other contexts where we have so many thousands of new arrivals and we need to protect them from measles because measles is circulating in the United States. They came here without measles and now they have been exposed to measles and we have to do everything we can to protect them.”Ige said Chicago has been working hard to take its responsibility to “safeguard the health of the new arrivals seriously.”“It is important to again emphasize that measles did not come with new arrivals,” he said. “Measles was already here, and those who got infected got infected because measles was circulating in Chicago.”Dr. Manisha Patel, the chief medical officer at the CDC, said there have been pandemic-related declines in vaccination and global measles activity has increased, raising the risk that people who are unvaccinated can get sick.“Activity is increased in areas of the country that Americans frequently visit, and that is one of our big concerns about upcoming spring break travel,” she said.Patel added that a key priority for the CDC is getting more children up to date on their vaccines. With a decline in the number of MMR vaccinations, she said, there are 750,000 kindergartners at risk of measles in the US.Overall, the US has good population immunity across the board, Patel said, “but if you’re not vaccinated or you don’t have immunity, measles will find you.”Ige said the hope is that everyone, not just migrants in shelters, will get vaccinated, since it is the best way to protect individuals and those who are not eligible to get the vaccine.“If you have children under the age of 1, they cannot be vaccinated. So the best way to protect them is to be vaccinated yourself and to ensure that all those who are around them are vaccinated,” he said. “Vaccination, vaccination, vaccination for everybody in the city whether you’re a new arrival or not. Vaccine-preventable diseases can be prevented by getting vaccinated.”CNN’s Kara Devlin has contributed to this report."

        "title": "Deep brain stimulation didn’t work for a young OCD patient until new brain maps changed everything",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Five years ago, in a wheelchair, Julia Hum was admitted to a state mental hospital in Massachusetts.After treatment with targeted deep brain stimulation, she hopes to walk out soon and, for the first time in her adult life, live independently, in her own apartment.Hum, 24, has severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, which once caused her to hurt herself and even affected her ability to eat and drink.“My OCD kind of convinced me food and drinks were contaminated,” Hum said. Her thoughts told her things like that her food had parasites or harmful chemicals.“I was fully aware of how ludicrous these thoughts were, and I desperately wanted to gain weight and eat enough and drink enough and be healthy. But the doubts I had were just so loud,” she said. “They were screaming, and I couldn’t focus on anything else.”Her heart rate and blood pressure became so erratic, she needed to use a wheelchair to move around. Doctors used a tube that led into her stomach through her nose to give her food and gave her fluids intravenously.Now, after treatment, she’s doing much better. In August, she got her high-school equivalency diploma and posed for a photo with the certificate with a wide smile on her face. She’s no longer hurting herself, and she can eat and drink normally. She says intrusive thoughts are no longer in control.“I feel like my OCD was kind of at the helm of the ship before, and now it’s kind of like a pesky passenger. It’s there, but it’s not taking over my life,” Hum said.She and her doctors credit this lifesaving improvement to innovative research that allowed them to more precisely target a dysfunctional circuit with a device called a deep brain stimulator, which acts like a pacemaker for her brain.Deep brain stimulators have been used for two decades for movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease and dystonia. More recently, their uses have been expanded to include mood disorders like depression and other neurological conditions such as Tourette’s syndrome and OCD.The devices have two electrodes that target a pea-size structure deep inside the brain called the subthalamic nucleus. This node, which looks like a contact lens, contains more than half a million nerve cells.It’s a hub for signals passing between the brain’s outer and inner layers. It’s like a switchboard, says Dr. Andreas Horn, a neurologist at the Brain Modulation Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital.Doctors implant the electrodes close to the subthalamic nucleus and then adjust the settings through a pulse generator that is implanted under the skin of the chest. After waiting about two weeks after surgery to let the body heal, they turn on the electricity and adjust the settings to find something that feels good to the patient.“I’ll suddenly feel lighter, my rituals will slow down, and I’ll sit up straighter and feel more energy,” as an example, Hum said.Hum had a deep brain stimulator implanted in 2021.Her psychiatrist, Dr. Darin Dougherty of the Mass General Research Institute, said it didn’t initially give them the results they’d hoped for.“It was this kind of cycle where we would find settings that felt really good. They would work maybe for a month or two, and then I’d slide backwards again because the initial effects would wear off,” Hum said.Deep brain stimulation can be life-changing, but it doesn’t work equally well for everyone, and researchers say they’re getting closer to understanding why.In a recent study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, Horn and an international team of researchers took data from more than 530 electrodes implanted in the brains of more than 200 people living with four conditions: Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, Tourette’s syndrome and OCD.They looked at where the devices were stimulating each person’s brain and how much improvement each had. Then, they used these records to map the nerve networks that seem to become dysfunctional in each of the four disorders.“The idea is that by learning from a cohort of patients and contrasting who got better with the ones that unfortunately did not get as much better after treatment, we can pinpoint where the optimal site is and maybe the optimal network to stimulate,” Horn said.The team used their maps to adjust deep brain stimulators for three patients, including Hum.All of them saw substantial improvement in their symptoms.Dr. Sameer Sheth, a professor of neurosurgery at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who was not involved in the study, says that the research is encouraging because it uses data from a large number of people but that trying it out in just three people isn’t enough to know whether these brain maps are accurate.“For the most part, this information has not been tested in the wild in a new set of patients, so that’s what this is setting up,” said Sheth, who also treats people with deep brain stimulation.If the same good results can be repeated in more patients, “then we should act on it. We should implant with this type of profile in mind for this type of patient, let’s say a patient with OCD,” he said.Using the maps created by Horn’s team and a special type of magnetic resonance imaging called diffusion imaging, doctors can see the fibers they need to stimulate to have the best chance of getting people well, Dougherty said.Each electrode implanted for the therapy has multiple points of contact that doctors can use to stimulate different brain areas.“We were then able to see which of those contacts was closest to the fibers that would be most likely to be helpful” for Hum, Dougherty said.They made adjustments to Hum’s settings in August, and she says the difference has been night and day.“It’s allowed me to focus,” Hum said. She notices that she can engage in therapy better, and she’s been able to create more distance between her thoughts and her actions.“I was able to more accurately label a thought as OCD and really not me and choose to make the decision not to engage in a ritual,” she said.She can also eat and drink “pretty much everything.”When she got her deep brain stimulator, Hum says, “my very basic hope was just even to have any sort of life at all, and now it’s much bigger than that.”She wonders if she can go to college, live independently and have a steady job. And she wonders about love.“Can I have a solid relationship with maybe a boyfriend and just all the things that I’ve kind of missed out on till this point?” she said.Hum said it’s hard to explain the gratitude she feels to the doctors and researchers who helped her.“Hope had really gone. I didn’t see a future for myself,” she said. “It kind of re-lit that light and the end of the tunnel.“It gave me my hope back.”"

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Actor Eric McCormack has weighed in on the debate around whether non-LGBT actors should be able to play gay characters.McCormack, who is straight but is best known for playing gay lawyer Will Truman in the NBC comedy series “Will & Grace,” said in an interview on British television Monday that he still hopes “the best person for the role” would be cast, regardless of their sexuality.Susanna Reid, a co-host on ITV’s “Good Morning Britain” show, asked McCormack what he thought about straight actors playing gay characters.“That’s a tough one for me, because I didn’t become an actor so that I could play an actor,” said McCormack.“There’s no part I’ve ever played where I wasn’t playing something I’m not. It’s part of the gig.”“And I’ve always said: ‘If gay actors weren’t allowed to play straight actors, Broadway would be over,’” he added.“So this is what we do. I’d like to think that I represent it well, you know, literally. I came from the theater, and one of my best friends was a gay man.”“So I think I took their spirit and their message in what was otherwise just a sitcom and, represented it, I hope,” said the Canadian-born actor.“Good Morning Britain” co-host Ed Balls then asked McCormack whether he felt he would be cast as Will if the show were being made today.“Well, I guess the answer would be, they’d have to say in the casting room: ‘And you’re gay, right?,’ which I don’t think they can say,” the actor responded.“So I still think, as you say, it’s hypothetical. I would like to think in general that the best person for the role, the one that comes in and knocks it out of the park, is the one that gets the part.”Created by Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, “Will & Grace” told the story of two co-dependent best friends – interior designer Grace Adler, played by Debra Messing, and McCormack’s lawyer Will – who share an apartment in New York City.Its depiction of single, urbanites – some gay, some straight – was considered groundbreaking at the time.The show debuted on NBC in September 1998 and ran until 2006, before returning from 2018 to 2020. In total, there were 246 episodes over 11 seasons."

In fact, filming her upcoming movie - an erotic thriller - was made all the more “liberating” by the knowledge her son was behind the camera, she has said.In an “Access Hollywood” interview discussing her upcoming role in “Strictly Confidential,” which was both written and directed by her son, Damian Hurley, the British actress said she felt “safe and looked after” both in the filming and post-production of the movie, which includes an intimate scene with actress Pear Chiravara.“It’s relaxing knowing someone’s behind the camera who looks out for you – which was the same on this movie in a way, because the things that his script needed me to do in this weren’t necessarily always done in movies many times before – but having him there meant I felt safe and looked after,” Hurley said in the interview, released Saturday, which also featured her 21-year-old son.“It’s kind of liberating to work with your family, I may do it again,” she added about her experience filming the erotic crime thriller, which is slated for release in April.The model and actress stars alongside Genevieve Gaunt and Georgia Lock in the film, which delves into the story of a young woman seeking to uncover the truth of her friend’s suicide.Damian Hurley added: “We felt in our comfort zone, it’s very strange.

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Translating kids’ animation to live-action is a tricky proposition, as Disney and the 2010 movie version of “Avatar: The Last Airbender” can attest. Netflix gets the look and action right in a lavish series based on the Nickelodeon show, but too-elemental dialogue and uneven performances make this eight-episode sit a bit of a grind for anyone who has gotten past puberty.Built around four tribes of “airbenders” with the ability to control water, earth, fire and air, “Avatar” establishes a mythical world filled with strange creatures and fantastic powers, none more so than those possessed by the Avatar, the legendary figure who alone can command all the elements.That heavy burden falls to a 12-year-old boy with a strategically placed arrow on his forehead, Aang (Gordon Cormier), who awakens after a century in ice to discover the firebenders and their leader Fire Lord Ozai (Daniel Dae Kim) have sought to take over the world, and, fearing the Avatar’s return, dispatched Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu) to neutralize him.Taken in by Sokka (Ian Ousley) and the waterbender Katara (Kiawentiio), Aang embarks on an episodic quest through this elaborate mythology, yielding familiar situations, the occasional fleeting hint of romance (which much of the logical audience will likely call “icky”) and no small amount of spinning, kicking, element-hurling action.Adapted by writer-showrunner Albert Kim (“Sleepy Hollow”), the series seems to consciously seek to correct the missteps of M. Night Shyamalan’s lightly regarded film version, without overcoming the creative hurdles raised by having two-dimensional youths as its featured players. The credible visual effects thus adorn what too often feels like a community-theater package, replete with stilted lines about how saving the world must wait if it means endangering friends.While derived from the animated series, bringing its trappings into live-action perhaps most charitably recalls the tone of “The Neverending Story,” a 40-year-old artifact (with more practical special effects) that also put a young boy at the center of its magic-filled journey.Ultimately, though, this feels like another pretty expensive bet by Netflix to capitalize on a proven title and the nostalgia surrounding it, after other animated-to-live-action series like the short-lived “Cowboy Bebop” and more recently “One Piece.”As with the latter show, the result is generally inoffensive, with the potential to run several seasons, but executed in such a blandly earnest way as to be unlikely to win over many who aren’t well versed in the material and eager to take the plunge.On the plus side, in terms of truth in advertising, at least Aang’s arrow is pointed in the right direction.“Avatar: The Last Airbender” premieres February 22 on Netflix."

        "text": "Haunting first-look images of Bill Skarsgård and FKA Twigs in the upcoming remake of the 1994 noir thriller “The Crow” were released on Wednesday, bringing renewed focus and honor to the classic’s original star, the late Brandon Lee.“Brandon was an original voice and I think he will always be synonymous with The Crow,” director of this year’s “Crow” remake Rupert Sanders said in an interview with Vanity Fair on Wednesday. “I hope he’s proud of what we’ve done and how we’ve brought the story back again.”Lee, the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, originated the role of the vengeful Eric Draven in “The Crow,” the Alex Proyas-directed supernatural thriller based on the comic book series by James O’Barr. In March 1993, 28-year-old Lee was accidentally shot and killed by a jammed prop gun on the film’s set.“His soul is very much alive in this film,” Sanders said of Lee this week.The first-look photos released on Wednesday showcase Skarsgård’s version of Draven, with a punk haircut and methodically-placed tattoos from head to toe. His signature black makeup is an eerie reminder of Lee’s Draven. Singer FKA Twigs is also seen in the photos, playing Draven’s love interest Shelly.While the 1994 film has become something of a cult classic, Sanders’ version of the film is a modern reimagining and veers from O’Barr’s source material. Despite the differences, the “Snow White and the Huntsman” director told Vanity Fair that his take is still a tribute to the memory of Lee.“Obviously, it was a terrible tragedy,” Sanders said of the star’s untimely death, adding that “it’s definitely something that we’ve always had in mind through the making of the film.”Describing Lee’s original take on Draven as a performance that possessed “fragility and beauty,” Sanders said he thinks that Skarsgård – known for his chilling rendition of Pennywise the Clown in the “It” remakes – “feels like he is a successor to that.”Sanders’ “Crow” follows Eric Draven (Skarsgård) and his fiancée Shelly, who are brutally murdered when Shelly’s dark past catches up with them.“Given the chance to save his true love by sacrificing himself,” an official synopsis reads, “Eric sets out to seek merciless revenge on their killers, traversing the worlds of the living and the dead to put the wrong things right.”“The Crow” is set to premiere in theaters on June 7."

        "title": "‘Shōgun’ might be the TV program of the year (again) in FX’s majestic new telling",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "In the early heyday of miniseries, “Shōgun” was the show of the year in 1980, and it might be again 44 years later. FX’s updated, sumptuous version of James Clavell’s sweeping novel blends an intoxicating combination of action, romance and political intrigue, majestically spread over 10 parts that, unlike most limited series, sustain that weight and then some.Set in feudal Japan at the start of the 17th century, the story begins with a European ship that reaches a fishing village under the stewardship of English pilot John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis).With Japan already visited by Portuguese merchants and Jesuit missionaries – turning the country into Portugal’s “secret empire in the East” – the locals are wary and indeed brutal toward the “barbarian” invaders, in scenes that pushed network standards back in 1980 and that are exceeded in those visceral qualities here.“I won’t die in this wretched land,” Blackthorne says defiantly, although given how the odds are stacked against him, that sounds like a hollow pledge.Soon, though, word of the English pilot, or “Anjin,” reaches Lord Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada, recently seen in “John Wick: Chapter 4,” and simply spectacular), who is in the midst of a perilous political battle with other members of the Council of Regents. Those tensions followed the death of Japan’s ruler, leaving a power vacuum until his young son is old enough to succeed him.That chaos also creates the possibility of one regent emerging to consolidate power, and perhaps even gain the title of shōgun. Eager to find any advantage, Toranaga brings the Anjin into his circle, enlisting the lady Mariko (Anna Sawai, in a big step up from Apple’s “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters”) to serve as his translator. Harboring her own complicated past, and locked in an unhappy marriage to the suspicious samurai Buntaro (Shinnosuke Abe), Mariko and Blackthorne gradually forge a bond filled with risk for both.Richard Chamberlain earned the nickname “King of the Miniseries” thanks to “Shōgun” (after Sean Connery passed on the part) and “The Thorn Birds,” and Jarvis, while perfectly fine, can’t match that level of leading-man charisma.Yet part of that has to do with shifting the narrative balance, smartly, toward both enhancing the female roles and the Japanese characters in general, as Toranaga jockeys with his principal rival Ishido (Takehiro Hira), realizing that strategically outmaneuvering him might be the only way to survive.“Shōgun” plunges into a feudal society where life often appears cheap, and ritual suicide (or seppuku) happens with a regularity that’s not for the faint of heart – or for that matter, when it comes to the muscular and stark action sequences, the weak of stomach.Still, if the original NBC miniseries was in many ways ahead of its time, this sweeping, heavily subtitled production arrives in an age that’s far more hospitable to this kind of ambitious storytelling. The only quibble would involve some creative liberties taken with the book near the end (the author’s daughter, Michael Clavell, is among the producers), which are provocative but not necessarily an improvement.Of course, in today’s heavily fragmented streaming environment “Shōgun” won’t be the massive ratings hit that it was back when there were three broadcast networks (and not much else), but those who wade into this dense history will be amply rewarded.“All men can be broken,” Toranaga muses at one point, with a quiet sense of menace and determination.If only all limited series could be half as good as “Shōgun.”“Shōgun” premieres February 27 on Hulu and at 10 p..m. ET the same day on FX."

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "As much about the singer-songwriter’s life now as then, “In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon” is an unabashed celebration of musical genius that’s at its best when looking back. Spanning 3 ½ hours, director Alex Gibney spends a bit too much time on Simon today, but it’s still a fitting tribute to a talent who, to quote his song, went looking for America, and had America and indeed the world find him in return.“Verse one,” as it’s labeled, of this two-part MGM+ presentation features Simon working on his 20th and final album, “Seven Psalms,” dealing with the frustration of hearing loss and the toll exacted on his frail-sounding voice as he quietly lives in Texas with his wife, singer Edie Brickell. (Simon met both Brickell and previous wife Carrie Fisher on “Saturday Night Live,” and producer Lorne Michaels is among the luminaries sharing memories.)Along the way, Gibney (adding to a musical filmography that includes biographies of Frank Sinatra and James Brown) goes back to Simon’s upbringing in Queens, New York, the formation of his partnership with childhood friend Art Garfunkel, and the belated breakthrough they achieved with “The Sound of Silence,” which, followed by their music’s use in director Mike Nichols’ “The Graduate,” vaulted them into the musical stratosphere.“I said to myself, ‘My life is irrevocably changed,’” Simon recalls, having attended (and hated) law school for a time before eventually dropping out.Despite extraordinary success, Simon describes what became “an uneven partnership,” with Simon writing the songs while Garfunkel went off to pursue an acting career (beginning with a role in Nichols’ “Catch-22”), placing stress on their relationship.Those tensions came to a head while producing “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” a vocal showcase for Garfunkel. Notably, Simon & Garfunkel (who, as an amusing footnote, originally went by the label-given name Tom & Jerry) couldn’t repair the fracture despite the appetite for them to do so after their historic reunion concert in Central Park, which attracted an estimated 750,000 people.Simon also goes out of his way to credit engineer Roy Halee for his contributions to those signature albums, a luxury that Gibney can indulge thanks to the sweeping nature of his canvas.Simon’s solo career, of course, went on swimmingly from there, with his inquisitive nature leading him to music from across the world, including South Africa, which somewhat controversially provided the foundation for his Grammy-winning album “Graceland.”While “In Restless Dreams” (a title drawn from a lyric in “The Sound of Silence”) will leave several of Simon’s songs echoing through one’s head for anyone familiar with them, Gibney nicely illustrates his multifaceted talents, including the comedic flair he exhibited on “Saturday Night Live” and his occasional forays into acting.Incorporating previously unseen footage, “In Restless Dreams” labors a bit to achieve a balance between interviewing Simon about his creative process and getting him to reminisce, 60 years after the album “Wednesday Morning 3 A.M.” put him this path to immortality.“Music comes out of you from where you don’t know,” Simon notes.Wherever it came from, the music that Simon produced – with Garfunkel and without him – yields a documentary that will leave anyone weaned on those songs feeling groovy all over again.“In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon” premieres March 17 on MGM+."

        "text": "It was a “yes across the board” for Kristen Wiig to play the lead in “Palm Royale,” a new Apple TV+ comedy set in Palm Beach high society in 1969.From the costumes to the set design, the series highlights the colorful glam of the era. Wiig plays Maxine, a social climber trying to land with the right movers and shakers in Palm Beach. She also executive produces, along with Laura Dern, who calls Wiig the “perfect Maxine” and the only person they had in mind for the role.“From getting a call from Laura Dern to reading the scripts and meeting everyone involved, it was really just, yes, across the board,” Wigg told CNN in a recent interview about the project. “I’ve never played a character like Maxine before and it honestly was just a gut feeling. You just kind of know in those cases whether it’s gonna be like a yes or a no. And this was just a very, very strong yes.”Her costar Josh Lucas, who plays opposite Wiig as her pilot husband Douglas, called working on the series with the “Saturday Night Live” alumna a “dream.”“We can’t overstate it,” Lucas told CNN. “Everything from the costume design, the sumptuous, extraordinary production design, and everything filled us with this reality of this world that is fictional in a way, but is completely based in this real world of what the late 1960s uber wealth, Palm Beach, mixed with the historical time that’s going on, all of it.”A blend of humor, satire and mystery, “Palm Royale” also features Carol Burnett, Bruce Dern, Allison Janney, Amber Chardae Robinson, Julia Duffy, Leslie Bibb, Kaia Gerber, Mindy Cohn and Ricky Martin.Martin plays Robert in the series, a man who works at the exclusive beach club and initially doesn’t trust Maxine. He says working with Wiig was inspiring.“It was wonderful to walk into the makeup room every day and just read lines with her. That set would set the tone for the rest of the day,” Martin said. “I’m very thankful because she’s just so generous. Even in moments where I felt nervous, she was there, her presence was very comforting. And I will always be very thankful for that.”“Palm Royale” premieres March 20 on Apple TV+."

        "title": "The ‘subversive spirituality’ of Bob Marley is still being overlooked",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Dean MacNeil couldn’t eat. Couldn’t sleep. He was on emotional autopilot because something “tore a hole in the soul of my family and me.”It was the summer of 1991, and MacNeil had taken a road trip from Connecticut to Vermont with his younger brother, Scott. They hiked, jet-skied and spent much of the time listening to Scott’s favorite musician, reggae superstar Bob Marley.A couple of weeks after the trip, a phone call came at midnight. Scott had been killed in a car accident. He was a passenger in another teenager’s car when it slammed into a tree. He was on his way home from a reggae concert. MacNeil was devastated.He found refuge, though, in Marley’s music. He started listening to Marley’s songs again and discovered something: Biblical verses were scattered like gems through virtually every one of them. The lyrics weren’t just nods to the Bible but lengthy scriptural quotations that called the listener to believe that no matter what kind of “changes” and “rages” they were experiencing, they could “never be blue,” as Marley says in “Forever Loving Jah,” a nod to the Rastafarian religion’s name for God.“That accident really sent my sister, mom, dad and myself into a tailspin,” MacNeil says today. “But Bob Marley’s music is what got us through. It helped us deal with the grief and the despair by listening to these messages of hope and perseverance. I went to the classroom of Bob Marley, because my very survival depended on it.”MacNeil found new meaning in the Marley adage: “You never know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice.” He started leading Bible studies at his church and completed a master’s degree in theology. He also became a musician and author of a book, “The Bible and Bob Marley: Half the Story Has Never Been Told.”Today, as Marley’s life is celebrated in a new hit movie, MacNeil and others make a bold claim: Marley’s spiritual impact is as significant as his musical legacy. The two are, in many ways, inseparable. These Marley fans and scholars say it’s time to stop glossing over or editing out Marley’s “subversive spirituality.”“The Bible was as important to Marley’s music as his guitar,” MacNeil says. “You really need to know the Bible to understand Marley’s message.”That’s not the typical message about Marley’s legacy that his fans get today. Since Marley’s untimely death in 1981, he has been defined as a musical icon.His smiling visage adorns T-shirts, bags, key chains, scented candles, lip balm, iPhone cases and posters in college dorm rooms. His album, “Exodus,” was selected as the best album of the 20th century by Time magazine. His song, “One Love” was named the song of the century by the BBC. Some critics even say Marley was the most influential songwriter of the 20th century.This is the version of Marley that primarily appears in the current hit film, “Bob Marley: One Love.” It offers a glimpse into Marley’s life in the late ’70s, when he became a symbol of reconciliation in his home country of Jamaica.But there’s another reason why many people don’t see Marley as a religious figure. There’s a less savory aspect to his personal life that the current film only touches on: Marley was a married man who reportedly fathered at least 11 children, some of them outside of his marriage to Rita Marley.So how can a man who fathered illegitimate children and smoked marijuana be considered a holy man?The answer can be found in the way that Marley lived and died. Start with his music. His musical career began and ended with a Biblical verse.Marley would often start concerts by reciting Biblical passages, MacNeil says. His first published song, “Judge Not,” recorded when he was 17, was based on Matthew 7:1 — a passage in which Jesus warned his followers to “Judge not, that ye be not judged.”The last track on his final album was “Redemption Song” (“How long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look?”). It was based on Luke 13:34, (“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you”).“His faith was central not only to his music but to what Rastafarians would call his ‘livity,’ which is his whole lifestyle, his whole approach to life,” says Vivien Goldman, a British journalist and educator who befriended Marley while working as his publicist.Marley invented a new species of musician: the holy rocker. Other musicians like Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash sang about their faith. But none cherished the Bible like Marley. Several biographers have noted that while on tour, Marley would often withdraw to a secluded spot on his bus to ponder scripture. He would then return to the rest of his bandmates and debate — not over women or song credits — but the meaning of biblical verses.There are classic stories of musicians who were inseparable from their instruments. Jimi Hendrix supposedly slept with his guitar. Marley had the same attitude toward his Bible.Goldman says that Marley never went anywhere without his weathered King James Bible, which had a photocopied portrait of the Lion of Judah in full regalia pasted on the cover, and photos of Haile Selassie I, the former emperor of Ethiopia, on the inside cover. Rastafarians consider Selassie, who died in 1975, as the second coming of Jesus, a Black messiah.“His spiritual practice was absolutely a crucial part of his life,” says Goldman, author of “The Book of Exodus: The Making and Meaning of Bob Marley and the Wailers’ Album of the Century.”“He would make time no matter what — if he was in a busy airport, he would retreat to the side so he could sit and study his Bible.”For some, God and the Bible are symbols of oppression. Both have been used to justify slavery, homophobia and imperialism. But Marley saw God as a liberator, a deliverer from political and personal oppression.In his song “Exodus,” he sang: “Jah come to break downpression, rule equality, wipe away transgression, set the captives free.”MacNeil says it’s almost impossible to listen to any Marley song without bumping up against the Bible. He examined 83 Marley songs and identified 137 Biblical references, comprised of 39 quotations and 98 allusions.Marley’s song, “Forever Loving Jah,” is a prime example. When Marley sings, “Because only a fool lean upon his own misunderstanding,” he’s quoting a scripture from Proverbs 3. And Marley’s album “Exodus” is named after a famous book in the Bible, revered by Jews and Christians.“He’s not just quoting the Bible,” MacNeil says. “He’s actively engaged with it. He’s interpreting it. He’s making it relevant to his own experience. He’s making it relevant to a wide audience.”Marley also made something else relevant to a wider audience: the Rastafari religion. No musical figure has, arguably, done more to popularize a religion than Marley. His beliefs revolved around Rastafarianism.But in the years since Marley’s death, his religious and political beliefs have been sanded down, reduced to a fuzzy, marijuana-inspired haze call for “One love, one heart. One destiny.” Some critics call this the “Disneyfication” of Marley’s legacy.But the Rastafari religion has a much gritter and more defiant edge. It was spawned by the tremendous suffering Afro-Jamaicans experienced for centuries. The slave trade, for example, was even more lethal in Jamaica, where Marley was born, than the Deep South of the US. More than twice as many slaves were shipped to Jamaica alone than all thirteen North American colonies. Most were tortured, raped and worked to death, according to Adam Hochschild, author of “Bury the Chains,” a history of the abolition movement in the United Kingdom.“The Caribbean was a slaughterhouse,” Hochschild wrote, describing the region’s slave trade.The grinding poverty, suffering and political disenfranchisement of Afro-Jamaicans persisted under British colonial rule. Marley was born in rural Jamaica to an Afro-Jamaican teenage mom and a White father. It is impossible to understand him and the Rastafari faith, which emerged in Jamaica during the 1930s, without knowing the country’s violent history.“Rastafari is a religion of resistance that blended Afrocentrism, Judaism, and Christianity,” says Deepak Sarma, a religious studies professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio.“Though it is often categorized as a religion, it is also a revolutionary ideology to right the wrongs of British imperialism, the slave trade, and colonization of Jamaica and other Caribbean islands.”Marley saw his music as a divine calling.“God sent me on earth. He send me to do something, and nobody can stop me,” he once said. “If God want to stop me, then I stop. Man never can.”Rastafarians, though, are known primarily by many casual observers for two elements of their religion: dreadlocks and the smoking of marijuana. The dreadlocks are inspired by an Old Testament passage from Leviticus 21:5, (“They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in the flesh”). Marijuana, or “ganja,” was seen as a sacrament for Rastafarians to deepen spiritual awareness.If there is a founder of the Rastafari religion, many point to Marcus Garvey, a Black Jamaican and activist who preached Black self-reliance, self-pride and led a “Back to Africa” movement in the first half of the 20th century. Selassie is also a central figure to Rastafarians in ways that puzzle some outsiders: How can Rastas worship a Black political figure who was also seen by some as a dictator?Goldman, Marley’s former publicist, recalled asking Marley about the wisdom of worshipping Selassie. She wrote that he was stunned by her question, asking:“So, you want me to worship a white god?”If an outsider fixates on the bitterness of Marley’s quote about a White god, it’s easy to fall for the myth that Rastafarians demonize White people. But one of the reasons Marley’s spiritual beliefs still resonate is his religion didn’t go that route.Marley didn’t limit oppression to one color.“I can’t be prejudiced against myself,” he once said when someone asked him if he was prejudiced against White people.“My father was a White and my mother Black, you know. Them call me half-caste, or whatever. Well, me don’t dip on the Black man’s side nor the White man’ side. Me dip on God’s side, the one who create me and cause me to come from Black and White.”Marley didn’t just live for his beliefs. He also died, in part, because of them.In 1977, Marley visited a doctor after noticing a blackened lesion under his big toenail. He was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer. The doctor advised Marley to amputate his toe to prevent the spread of cancer. But he refused because he thought it would violate the Rasta prohibition against the “cutting of the flesh,” and opted for a less invasive procedure.The cancer eventually spread. Marley died on May 11, 1981, in Miami while trying to return to his beloved Jamaica for his final days. A man who was a fitness and health food fanatic died at 36.Marley was honored with a state funeral in Jamaica at the National Arena in Kingston. He was buried with his favorite Gibson Les Paul guitar and his personalized Bible, opened to Psalm 23, which begins with, “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.”In an interview several years before his death, Marley said a person achieves a sense of immortality by having a right relationship with God.“I don’t believe in death, neither in flesh nor in spirit . . . Death does not exist for me. I truly know God,” Marley said.His musical legacy has found an afterlife. Marley’s stature on the international stage has only grown in the decades since his death. It’s ironic that Marley, a fierce critic of capitalism and materialism, posthumously generated $16 million through his estate in 2023, according to Forbes magazine, right behind John Lennon of the Beatles.That type of immortality, of course, wasn’t what Marley was talking about. He alluded to an “ever-living” legacy. It’s the faith of an abandoned kid from the slums of Jamaica who knew hardship and abandonment but assured his listeners in his classic “Three Little Birds,” “Don’t worry about a thing, ‘Cause every little thing is gonna be alright.”Somewhere in the world right now someone is playing a Bob Marley song to help them get through a difficult time — the kind that tears a hole in someone’s soul.Marley was right. When it comes to his music and his spiritual message — death does not exist.He is more alive today than ever before.John Blake is the author of “More Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.”"

        "text": "There’s no place like home for legendary musician Lionel Richie.For Richie, that is the historic town of Tuskegee, Alabama, where he’s bringing his fellow “American Idol” judges Katy Perry and Luke Bryan to show them his roots on a new episode of the singing competition series.“I was born and raised with the Tuskegee Airmen,” Richie said in an exclusive clip shared with CNN from Sunday’s upcoming episode, going on to explain that the “Airmen were the first group of Black air force pilots who bravely fought in World War II. This was a time before integration.”Before World War II, Black Americans were not allowed to become aviators in the military, but the US Army Air Corps created what was then an experimental training program for Black aviators – later referred to as the Tuskegee Airmen – at Alabama’s Tuskegee Army Airfield.In the “American Idol” clip, the trio of judges are seen touching down and are greeted by uniformed military personnel who present each of them with their very own leather aviator jackets.They venture onto the campus of Tuskegee University, where they receive a warm and rousing welcome from the school’s students, cheerleaders and marching band.This season on “Idol,” all three judges are featured bringing each other to their respective hometowns where they hold auditions. Perry hails from Santa Barbara, California, and Bryan is a Leesburg, Georgia native.Richie said in a 2023 interview with “GMA” anchor Robin Roberts that he was looking forward to bringing his “Idol” costars and the show to his hometown, saying he felt it was a chance to “get them to understand the roots of another kind of Black America that people don’t get to hear and talk about every day.”The town is certainly a special place for the Grammy-winner, who said in this week’s clip that despite his success as an artist, “Tuskegee for me was about as far away from music as you could possibly think of.”In 2012, Richie brought his music much closer to home when he released his 10th studio album, titled “Tuskegee,” which features duets with various country artists performing his classic hits.“Coming back to Tuskegee was wonderful, it was overwhelming,” Richie said in the “American Idol” clip. “It was just one of those moments where I had to kind of reflect.”With pride, Richie added, “And it’s still home.”The full episode of “American Idol” will air this Sunday on ABC at 8 p.m. in the viewer’s timezone."

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "After her Emmy-winning roles in “Mildred Pierce” and “Mare of Easttown,” HBO would probably say “yes” to a series in which Kate Winslet reads the phone book. Alas, they’ve come a little too close to that with “The Regime,” a political satire that’s weird but not very good, other than savoring Winslet’s over-the-top antics as an autocratic leader.Political satire can be hard work, and this creation from writer Will Tracy (whose credits include “The Menu” and “Succession”), working with directors Stephen Frears and Jessica Hobbs (whose regal credentials include “The Queen” and “The Crown,” respectively), too often goes for the broad and below the belt, which makes it feel less savvy than it clearly aspires to be.Paranoid and mercurial, Winslet’s Chancellor Elena Vernham heads a fictional country in Central Europe, whose possession of cobalt mines forces representatives of bigger nations – including a US senator (Martha Plimpton) – to take an interest in its stability and future.When the story begins, Vernham is already engaging in odd behavior that leaves her ministers (who assemble in “Dr. Strangelove”-esque meeting rooms) exchanging pained expressions, before she recruits a disgraced soldier, Herbert Zubak (Matthias Schoenaerts, seen in “Amsterdam” and “Red Sparrow”), as her confidant and near-constant companion. Confused at first, Herbert gradually occupies an increasingly significant role in affairs of state, which only makes Vernham’s stewardship, and her grip on her exalted position, more tenuous.Like everything else in this six-episode series, the Elena-Herbert relationship is decidedly strange, confounding her aide (Andrea Riseborough) and husband (Guillaume Gallienne). As for the ministers, eager to protect their phony-baloney jobs, they privately express hope she’ll simply become bored with this latest plaything, implying that Herbert isn’t the first stray the chancellor has brought into her orbit.While there’s a seemingly fertile idea in watching how an autocracy crumbles from within and without, as unchecked power breeds a kind of insanity, the more cerebral aspects largely get lost in the show’s eccentricities, overwhelming any sense of nuance.Isolated from her people in a garish palace, there’s some logic in Elena seeking out someone like Herbert as an anchor, but his quirks merely add to the lunacy, clouding who’s really manipulating whom. Even what amounts to an extended cameo by Hugh Grant as an imprisoned rival can’t do much to class up the joint.Lustily sneering her dialogue in an exaggerated accent, Winslet throws her all into the character, but to what end? Forced to exit the palace, the delusional leader finds herself needing help at one point, saying naively, “No one could refuse my face.”HBO, understandably, would have found it difficult saying “no” to a limited series with the deservedly decorated star at its center. But after watching “The Regime,” consider this an offer they probably should have refused.“The Regime” premieres March 3 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery."

        "title": "Inside Hollywood’s new effort to curb gun deaths",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "An elite police tactical officer comes home after an exhausting shift.He and his wife begin sharing details of their respective day – the cop recounting a harrowing moment saving the life of a woman and her child.But before officer Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson settles in, he has an important stop to make. Hondo heads to the bedroom closet, removes his semi-automatic service weapon, and safely locks it away in his gun safe.This scene is much more than a brief pause in the non-stop action on the hit CBS television show “S.W.A.T.,” rather, the intentional result of a new partnership between Hollywood and safety advocates to help save lives in an era of seemingly endless gun violence.“I’m big badass Hondo, and I get out there and take down bad guys,” actor Shemar Moore, who plays Hondo, told CNN. “But when I come home…I own a firearm, but it’s safe, it’s protected.”This approach of utilizing the entertainment industry to model safe practices is one of the successes of “Show Gun Safety,” a campaign launched by the advocacy group Brady United, which is now partnering with television studios across the country.“We lose eight kids a day in this country — a uniquely American epidemic — to family fire,” Kris Brown, president of Brady United, told CNN. “That’s because of firearms in the home that are not safely stored.”Last year, the group organized a White House roundtable with actors and writers, including “S.W.A.T.” showrunner Andrew Dettmann.“I think the thing that really pulled me was when they were talking about the fact that guns had become the number one killer of kids,” Dettmann told CNN during a recent visit to the Sony Pictures set where “S.W.A.T.” is filmed.While gun policies can be politically polarizing, Dettmann said encouraging the safe storage of firearms shouldn’t be controversial at all.“This is not part of that larger gun debate,” he said, noting the show’s audience includes individuals across the political spectrum. However, he believes the drama’s approach to depicting guns properly secured is a “common sense” issue that could shape viewer behavior and prevent gun accidents.“Stow it safely, don’t leave it out in the house, and if they see their favorite characters doing it on a regular basis, maybe that influences them some way.”The influence of Hollywood is backed by academic research.“People think media characters are cool – they want to be like them,” said Brad Bushman, Professor of Communication at The Ohio State University, who has studied how witnessing safe gun practices impacts behavior. “If they view their favorite character using guns in a safe way, then what they learn is a script for how they can behave themselves.”Bushman said viewers “encode” behavior they see on screen in their own memory, which is tapped into when someone finds themselves in a similar situation as an actor.While the production team at “S.W.A.T.” has purposefully incorporated safe gun storage into their scripts, they haven’t stopped there. The show has also curbed the amount of gunfire shown.“Maybe the director had an automatic weapon in mind, but maybe we can pull that back and just have it be a few shots so that we don’t have all this gratuitous gunfire with no consequences,” Dettmann said.“We’ve got to start normalizing this behavior across the board,” Christian Heyne, chief policy officer of Brady United, and a gun violence survivor whose mother was shot and killed in 2005, told CNN.Heyne hopes the organization’s “Show Gun Safety” campaign succeeds like past advocacy partnerships with Hollywood to deglamorize smoking and to promote safe driving.“You will never see somebody get into a car on a film or on television and not put a seatbelt on. We have to be thinking the same way about gun violence,” Heyne said, “to really create a movement in Hollywood where this becomes second nature. If you’re able to impact culture and policy, you will significantly lower the gun death rate.”Back out on the set of “S.W.A.T.,” Moore had just finished filming a scene. The father of a young daughter both on and off screen, and a gunowner himself, paused to describe what it’s like knowing his performance on the show might save lives.“If people are going to watch me and listen to me, and I know that by behavior – by how I present myself – somebody could follow suit, that’s a huge responsibility,” he said. “So hopefully this is a reminder to the adults, to the parents, to be extra cautious.”"

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Zoë Kravitz had some beautiful, and sometimes biting, words for her “cool dad” Lenny Kravitz on Tuesday, as the rocker received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Toward the beginning of her tribute to her father, the “Batman” actor said, “being your daughter has been one of the great adventures of my life.”She then explained that since her father was relatively young when she was born, “in many ways, we’ve grown up together.”Lenny Kravitz was 24 years old when he welcomed daughter Zoë with his ex-wife Lisa Bonet.“We’ve been through a lot. We’ve seen a lot. I’ve seen a lot. I’ve seen you change in the most beautiful ways, I’ve seen the way you’ve stayed the same in the most important ways,” the younger Kravitz said, before her remarks took on a more humorous tone.“I’ve seen the way you show up, take care of the people you love – I’ve seen your incredible dedication to your art, but mostly, I’ve seen through your shirts,” she said, to laughs. “According to my dad, if it doesn’t expose your nipples, it’s not a shirt.”The “Big Little Lies” star admitted that she’d sometimes get embarrassed when her dad would pick her up from school – presumably decked out in said type of shirt – “but I gotta say, at this point, I respect it.”“You really do pull it off. Your relationship with the knitted shirt is probably your longest one, and it works,” she said.The “Are You Gonna Go My Way” singer’s only child then said that all her life, when people ask her what it’s like to have a “such a cool dad,” she answers, “awesome.”“But not for the reasons some might think,” she explained. “What’s cool about you is not what people think is cool about you. Your radness doesn’t come from your shades or your leather pants or knitted shirts. It comes from your true love for life.”Lenny Kravitz is a four-time Grammy winner, with hits including “American Woman” and “Fly Away,” among others. The New York City-born singer-songwriter is well known for his rocker-cool style, perennial shade-wearing and smooth vocals. This spring, he is slated to release his twelfth studio album, titled “Blue Electric Light.”In her tribute to her father on Tuesday, Zoë Kravitz further gushed, “your music, your lyrics, your live performances, your homes, your love of food, of family, of good conversations, stupid jokes, dance parties, late night kitchen talks – you absolutely devour life. You eat up every crumb and lick the plate. Life is your art and that is why your music is so inspiring and important.”Oscar-winning actor Denzel Washington also honored Lenny Kravitz on Tuesday, calling the musician “more than a friend, he’s more than a brother.”“We’re twins, we just don’t look alike. We’ve had a close brothership, friendship … for 30 years,” Washington added. “God has blessed him with an unbelievable talent, but even more so, an unbelievable heart.”After the ceremony, the elder Kravitz spoke with CNN about receiving the honor.“That’s surreal, and mind-blowing,” he said of receiving his star, later adding that he’s “so blessed to have these folks with me, that have walked this journey with me.”CNN’s David Daniel contributed to this story."

        "title": "‘The Gentlemen’ offers a few highs in a Guy Ritchie series that’s mostly smoke and mirrors",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "The story behind “The Gentlemen” might be more interesting than the show, with director Guy Ritchie rebooting his 2020 movie as an eight-episode Netflix series. Yet despite the dashing presence of Theo James as the unexpected heir to a cannabis empire, the net result blows by briskly enough but yields relatively few highs.James’ Eddie returns from military service in the British army to discover that his late father, the Duke of Halstead, has left him the family’s sprawling “Downton Abbey”-sized estate, bypassing his understandably gobsmacked older brother, Freddy (Daniel Ings). The real surprise, though, comes when Eddie discovers that the property has become home to a criminal enterprise, forcing Eddie to deal with those behind it, his main contact being Susie (Kaya Scodelario), the ice-cold daughter of the reigning boss (Ray Winstone).Lots of hair-trigger situations, violence and frantic negotiations ensue, as Eddie labors to compensate for his brother’s stupidity while trying to extricate the family from its ties to an assortment of nefarious and eccentric characters, leading to darkly comic encounters that give the show a decidedly episodic feel.Despite Ritchie’s trademark visual style (seen in “The Wrath of Man” and the Robert Downey Jr.-starring Sherlock Holmes movies), which coincides with lots of crank-up-the-volume music, there’s not much to distinguish the show from a host of others where ordinary folk find themselves thrust into a criminal milieu, sometimes discovering reservoirs of grit and sides of their personalities they barely recognize.Still, similar concepts like “Breaking Bad” and “Ozark” have set a high bar, which might help explain the “meh” verdict. That’s despite a nice starring turn by James – much better served here than he was in “The Time Traveler’s Wife” – and a lot of classy talent on the fringes: Giancarlo Esposito (playing a character not far removed from his “Breaking Bad” role) as a drug lord with an interest in Eddie’s estate; Vinnie Jones as Halstead Manor’s gamekeeper; and Joely Richardson as Eddie’s mother, who is rather deliciously unflustered by all these dirty doings.Indeed, part of the fun in these scenarios involves the gradual transformations and strange connections that occur when, to quote “The Gentlemen’s” ad line, “Old money meets drug money.”In this show, though, it’s really more a case of an old idea meeting new packaging, with the added allure of attaching a director with a strong (if somewhat uneven) creative pedigree and vision.Ritchie clearly appears to have had fun expanding upon the concept of his earlier film, which starred Matthew McConaughey. Whether the new mixture of talent and tone provides enough rationale for Netflix to invest its relatively new money is debatable for a show whose appeal, beyond the general atmosphere, mostly boils down to smoke and mirrors.“The Gentlemen” premieres March 7 on Netflix."

Night Shyamalan’s “The Village” in 2004, the actress said her parents had strict rules against working as a child actor.“My parents were very firm on that boundary, that they were not going to support anyone who wanted to be a child actor,” she told People.Her father, who as a kid played Opie Taylor on “The Andy Griffith Show” from 1960 to 1966 and later starred in “Happy Days,” explained their thinking.“It’s possible for child performers to really find a lot that is positive within it, but it’s fraught with landmines,” he said. “On top of everything else, because the characters that I played as a child were so well-known as to almost be iconic, I also thought, ‘Hey, if one of our kids tries to act as a child, boy or girl, they’re going to be unfairly compared.’”Bryce Howard said she is happy with their decision.“I’m really glad that they did that because when I did start acting, it took a while to make a living.

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "After fighting “The Good Fight” for streaming, the producers of “The Good Wife” indulge in a more CBS-friendly spinoff with “Elsbeth,” which breezily takes Carrie Preston’s quirky title character and turns her into a modern version of “Columbo.” About all that’s missing is the latter’s “Oh, one thing” method of springing the final trap.The pilot sets up Elsbeth Tascioni’s fast-talking attorney by relocating her from Chicago to New York, where she’s positively giddy about everything associated with the Big Apple, from the Statue of Liberty to the theater. The reason for said move involves having her become the appointed liaison to oversee the police because of a consent decree related to what she diplomatically describes as “some teeny corruption problems.”Of course, the NYPD and its captain (Wendell Pierce, somewhat underemployed) aren’t thrilled about having Elsbeth around, and he assigns a quiet officer (Carra Patterson) to keep an eye on her. Still, Elsbeth’s mandate provides her with the opportunity to wade into investigations, and she does so with a disarming style that causes everyone to underestimate her.Created by Robert and Michelle King, there’s a teeny serialized aspect to the premise, but really not much that departs from the classic murder-of-the-week format. The series also employs the old device of identifying the killer in the early moments, putting the audience a step ahead of everyone except perhaps Elsbeth, who has a knack for zeroing in on the smallest of clues.The episodes previewed include Stephen Moyer, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Jane Krakowski as guest stars, with Ferguson portraying the producer of a very Bravo-like reality show called “Lavish Ladies,” where one of the regulars winds up dead.Preston received a guest-star Emmy for the role back in 2013, so the stand-alone series represents a long-delayed effort to wring extra mileage from “The Good Wife’s” legacy while hewing to the kind of comfort-food formula that still works reasonably well for the traditional networks – an appetite CBS has recently fed with its other new procedural drama, “Tracker.”Granted, there’s not a whole lot about that approach to prompt wild enthusiasm, but to those looking for a modest diversion, Preston is good company, and the writing is intermittently clever. Besides, the irrepressible Elsbeth has enough enthusiasm for all of us.“Elsbeth” premieres February 29 at 10 p.m. ET on CBS."

        "title": "‘Love on the Spectrum’ reveals the challenges of autism representation",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Editor’s Note: This article uses both person-first and identity-first language, in keeping with the latest conversations among autism communities and advocates.It’s rare to see autism portrayed in media, and rarer still to see representation for adults with autism. The Netflix reality show “Love on the Spectrum,” based on an Australian show with the same name, is arguably the most visible program where people can see what it’s like for real autistic adults to navigate the challenges of life and love.The show follows a group of adults with autism as they navigate the dating world, aided by a relationship coach and the input of their loved ones. Despite its generally warm reception, the show has also received criticism from within adult autism communities. Some see it as a kind, compassionate representation of the social challenges people with autism face. Others see any good faith representation as a step in the right direction, even if it’s incomplete.“‘Love on the Spectrum’ is kind, but unrepresentative,” reads a review of the first season posted on Spectrum, an autism news and research publication.In online forums, some adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have taken issue with production details: A violin plucks a childlike motif when people describe their special interests and hobbies. Descriptions from family and friends, though well meaning, sometimes carry the tone of one speaking about a child rather than a grown adult. Throughout their dating journey, advice the cast receives sometimes encourages a “normalcy” that is, frankly, unnatural to many people with autism.“While it’s nice to see representation, some of the ways they portray people’s behaviors and their likes and dislikes feels like they’re playing into stereotypes of autistic people as being weird or childlike when they’re not,” Krista Ferguson, a 42-year-old with ASD and a member of Reddit’s 342,000-member autism subreddit, told CNN.Rather than being a criticism of the show in particular, the reactions to “Love on the Spectrum” speak to deeper nuances within the autism community that often go unnoticed. They also reveal gaps in the way allistic (non-autistic) people understand the autistic mind; that “normal” is sometimes neither possible nor desired, and that love — and acceptance, and success — are not things to be gained at the expense of suppressing one’s true self.Cast members on “Love on the Spectrum” make it clear they want to find someone who loves them for them.For some, that means a partner who will participate in their special interests, whether it’s medieval history or a love of cosplay. One could practically hear swoons when animal lover Abbey Romeo, a Season 1 favorite who continued her dating journey in Season 2, joined her boyfriend David Isaacmen on a trip to Africa — an adventure he had planned especially for her. For others, it means a partner who supports specific sensitivities or displays patience and understanding in challenging situations.It’s not uncommon to see very matter-of-fact language as cast members clarify the particulars of their romantic expectations. “I hope you don’t think me blunt, but I kind of like you, and I was wondering if maybe you’d like to hold hands,” cast member Connor Tomlinson tells one of his partners during a speed date. Another cast member suggests to her date that they have a round of kissing practice on cupcakes before trying the real thing.Obviously, not every date works out, and “Love on the Spectrum” shows daters weighing their fears of being alone with their fears of settling for someone who’s not quite right. When cast member Steve Spitz started to get close to a woman he wasn’t sure about, he ended up cutting ties rather than ignoring discomfort in the name of love.“I learned that finding love isn’t an easy process,” Spitz told Netflix after Season 2 was released. “There’s so much more to finding love than just having similar interests. You have to be compatible, trusting, and fair to the other person.”Autism among adults is often hard to understand due to a lack of research and public awareness. The first US study of adults with autism wasn’t published until 2020. Despite its conclusion that an estimated 5.5 million US adults live with ASD, most high-profile autism research and advocacy revolves around children with autism and their parents. Fearing stigma and discrimination, many adults with autism keep their condition a secret. Even more adults may live with autism and not know it, or avoid a diagnosis.When autism is visible, whether it’s in our own social circles or on a TV show, the individual experience is never representative of the whole.“When we’re talking about a spectrum, there’s an infinite number of ways a person can be autistic, so there are also endless possibilities for how a person can be seen or portrayed,” said André Felipe de Medeiros, a neurodivergent podcaster and journalist from São Paulo, Brazil.In his limited viewing of “Love on the Spectrum,” Medeiros said he found a “good mix of people presenting different traits that can be found on the spectrum.” These traits can include different tolerances to social situations or stimuli, varied speech patterns and conversational habits, the presence of verbal or physical “stimming,” (self-regulating with repetitive motions or vocalizations) physical differences and the need for some kind of supportive care.He also recommended the scripted shows “Everything’s Gonna Be Okay” and “Atypical” as two examples where autism representation hit the mark.“On both shows, different characters on the spectrum had different traits, giving viewers a broader picture of what autism can be,” he told CNN.“Good autism representation comes from being open to understanding that the spectrum is incredibly vast and being honest about how the way an autistic person or character is being represented is only one of infinite possibilities.”On “Love on the Spectrum,” the focus for participants is mostly on social interactions — the infinite web of cues and clues that make dating hard for anyone, let alone people with differently-wired brains. That’s definitely part of it, but limiting the challenges of ASD to some double-black-diamond social gauntlet ignores larger experiences of autism.“Autism is so much more than social communication,” said Dr. Megan Anna Neff, a clinical psychologist and author of “Self-Care for Autistic People.” “We have very sensitive nervous systems. Part of that is how we take in sensory information and stressors, and there are a lot of things we do to accommodate that.”Neff says common “autistic” traits like adhering to routines and disliking unexpected change may manifest in a social way, but are really speaking to something different.“All of these things that are so-called symptoms of autism are really ways that we are adapting to our nervous system to be able to move through the world,” she said.Having to constantly regulate in a way that most people don’t can lead to other behaviors that are considered to be outside of the social norm, like seeking long periods of time alone. While some people might find this concerning, Neff said for many people with autism, it is a necessary form of self-care.One of the most frustrating things for autistic adults is the pressure to act “normal” — a pressure that, for better or worse, is reflected in shows like “Love on the Spectrum.” On the show, dating coaches gently instruct participants how to act in socially typical ways. That often means suppressing natural autistic tendencies like stimming and editing oneself in conversations to avoid, say, speaking too forcefully or talking at length about a special interest.The fact is, many people with autism already engage in some form of self-censorship. It’s called “masking,” and while it is a common way for autistic adults to fit into social situations, it’s also extremely draining and isolating.“When we mask, we suppress the urge to communicate authentically, or to soothe our bodies in ways that might look different to others,” said Neff. “So perhaps other people might feel more connected to me when I mask, but I’m going to feel less connected to them. It can facilitate small talk, but it doesn’t actually forge authentic connection.”Sometimes, Neff said, autistic people find masking necessary — but it’s also a privilege that many on the spectrum simply cannot access.That diversity of ability and comfort with suppressing natural behaviors makes media representation even more complicated. Some critics of shows like “Love on the Spectrum” say it doesn’t acknowledge a wide array of ASD experiences, which can include physical, verbal and intellectual differences. While Neff says she’d like to see more diversity of race, gender and sexuality in such programs, she says the experiences that do get portrayed are just as valid.“I think there’s some division happening in the autistic advocacy space among those who mask and those who don’t. There’s a temptation to see a show and be like, well, that doesn’t show me,” she said.“But for those who present in a more stereotypical way, who do mask and want to fit in, they might feel seen. So I think it’s always important to show the many ways we present. We need a kaleidoscope of representation.”"

        "title": "‘Manhunt’ struggles to find the drama in Apple’s Lincoln-assassination thriller",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "What sounds like an enticing historical thriller mostly falls flat in “Manhunt,” an Apple TV+ series about the frantic search for John Wilkes Booth after he assassinated Abraham Lincoln. Using flashbacks to flesh out the seven episodes, the show lacks the narrative momentum the title would suggest, feeling a little too much like homework by landing in a no-man’s land that doesn’t find the sweet spot between politics and true crime.Adapted from James L. Swanson’s bestselling book, “Manhunt” largely oscillates between two principal characters: Edwin Stanton (Tobias Menzies of “The Crown” and “Outlander” renown), Lincoln’s Secretary of War – who filled the leadership vacuum created by his boss’ death while being wracked with guilt for not having been at his side – and Booth (Anthony Boyle, also featured in Apple’s “Masters of the Air”), who managed to stay ahead of the authorities for days despite an injured leg thanks to a network of like-minded confederates.Stanton’s arc includes cutting back to the prosecution of the Civil War and his relationship with Lincoln (Hamish Linklater, mostly unrecognizable while nailing the reedy voice), as on-air graphics grimly count down to the president’s fateful trip to Ford’s Theatre.As for Booth, his odyssey takes him to various stops, including the home of friendly doctor Samuel Mudd (Matt Walsh), while his fame as an actor, even in this pre-screen era, serves as both a help and occasional hindrance to his efforts to escape.Despite seeking to flesh out the story with detours into the actions of peripheral players – a conceit that tends to work better in literary form – the structure undercuts the dramatic tension. And while Menzies brings considerable gravitas to Stanton’s impressive juggling of tasks, turning him into a sort-of detective spearheading the hunt for Booth feels a trifle strained.Perhaps foremost, what should represent a chance to zoom in on one aspect of a fascinating chapter in history, one that has echoed across decades, suffers because none of the characters really hold your attention. That’s especially true of Booth, through no fault of Boyle’s, who as written possesses less depth than his flamboyantly villainous mustache.“Manhunt” starts a bit better than it finishes, faring best in capturing the chaos throughout Washington immediately following the assassination, and the political fallout as Stanton seizes and steadies the reins of government. That challenge is magnified by his lack of faith in or respect for Vice President Andrew Johnson (“24” alum Glenn Morshower), whose initial response to the horrifying news is to get drunk.“Manhunt” sounds promising on paper, only to mirror Apple’s even-splashier World War II series “Masters of the Air” by offering a meticulously produced window into the past that only fitfully gets off the ground.To paraphrase a very old line: other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show? While it would be nice to enthusiastically endorse an ambitious project with classy credentials, doing so would hardly honor the example set forth by Honest Abe.“Manhunt” premieres March 15 on Apple TV+. (Disclosure: Lowry’s wife works for a division of Apple.)"

        "text": "Richard Simmons has apologized after posts he made on social media caused concern and speculation about his health.It all began when Simmons, who is 75, posted an ominous message to X and Facebook on Monday: “I have some news to tell you. Please don’t be sad. I am …. dying. The truth is we all are dying. Every day we live we are getting closer to our death.”He added: “Why am I telling you this? Because I want you to enjoy your life to the fullest every single day. Get up in the morning and look at the sky… count your blessings and enjoy.”In a later post Monday, Simmons said he was “sorry for the confusion.”“Sorry many of you have gotten upset about my message today. Even the press has gotten in touch with me,” the fitness celebrity wrote on a post on X. “I am not dying.”In fact, Simmons said, his message was meant to be one about “how we should embrace every day that we have.”When reached by CNN prior to Simmons’ apology, Tom Estey, a spokesman for Simmons, also asserted that the posts were meant to be motivational in nature and not a personal announcement related to his health.“I can confirm with one hundred percent certainty that Richard is not dying,” Estey told CNN. “He’s, in fact, very healthy and happy. The sole purpose of the post was meant to be inspirational.”In the thread of posts on his X page stemming from his original post, Simmons writes about healthy eating and encouraged his followers to check out his workout videos available on his YouTube channel.“A big hug really goes a long way,” he wrote at the end of his post.Simmons grew a fitness business and became a television regular in the 1980s, with a reputation as a gregarious health advocate.He has remained out of the public eye in recent years, but the circumstances surrounding his whereabouts and wellbeing has provided a fair share of internet fodder.On occasion, Simmons will share personal updates on his social media pages, writing in a January Facebook post, “I just try to live a quiet life and be peaceful.”"

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Built atop a provocative-sounding title and premise, “The American Society of Magical Negroes” starts and ends quite well. Almost everything in between, alas, proves uneven and inert in a way that dilutes its satirical punch, making this an interesting introduction for first-time writer-director Kobi Libii but a less than satisfying one.Like “American Fiction,” the basic concept hinges on the way Black people are seen – and especially depicted in various forms of media – by a white-dominated culture. The “magical negro” refers, as the director’s statement explains, to “a narrative device in which a Black supporting character exists solely to serve a white protagonist’s storyline.”Plenty of movies and TV through the years have fallen into that dubious basket, and Libii might have been better served by weaving in clips (assuming the budget would have allowed for that) instead of satirically replicating them, which is the approach employed here.Still, the film gets off to a reasonably good start as Aren (Justice Smith), a struggling artist, is recruited to join the secret society by one of its members, Roger (David Alan Grier, easily the movie’s strongest asset), who observes his awkward demeanor toward Whites at an art-gallery event.As Roger explains it, the shadowy society provides “client services” for white people in need of some sort of emotional support, because “white discomfort” represents an enduring danger to Black people. Gifted with semi-magical powers to assist in their tasks, the operatives proceed from a playbook that includes making themselves “acceptable to Whites” while still managing to seem authentically Black.After his rapid orientation, though, Aren quickly embarks on an assignment that involves becoming the helpful pal of Jason (“The Other Two’s” Drew Tarver), an employee at a very-Facebook-like social-media firm called Meetbox, who wants to rise within the company’s ranks and realizes that he has a crush on Lizzie (An-Li Bogan), one of his coworkers. Unfortunately, Aren feels the same way about her, plaguing him with conflicted feelings as he endeavors to fulfill his mission.While Libii appears to be going for natural and relaxed in the performances and interactions, there’s a flatness to much of what transpires. And while Smith has experience playing against fantastical situations (see “Detective Pikachu”), the character and the key rom-com component remain too thinly drawn through much of the film.The ending nearly redeems that, but not entirely, or at least, not enough to endorse this as a theatrical experience as opposed to the “Whenever I find it streaming somewhere” option.That’s too bad, since the core issue, and relegating people of color to secondary roles, resonates in a way that’s both timely and timeless, in everything from movies to the “Black best friend” trope in sitcoms.Principally known as an actor, Libii found a way to get this ambitious project made, which itself feels like an accomplishment for a new director. Mostly, though, “The American Society of Magical Negroes” demonstrates that truly nailing this kind of satire requires a deft, if not magical, touch.“The American Society of Magical Negroes” premieres March 15 in US theaters. It’s rated PG-13."

        "text": "It’s been nearly 13 years since “The Oprah Winfrey Show” came to an end, but for viewers of her weight loss special on Monday night, it likely felt like Winfrey’s talk show was back.“An Oprah Special: Shame, Blame and the Weight Loss Revolution” featured Winfrey doing what she proved for 25 seasons on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” she can do better than just about anyone else: bring people together and get them talking – and listening – to each other.“I wanted to do this special for the more than 100 million people in the United States and the over 1 billion people around the world who are living with obesity,” Winfrey said as she introduced the program. “Maybe that’s you or maybe that’s somebody you love.”“In my lifetime I never dreamed we would be talking about medicines that would be providing hope to people, like me, who have struggled for years with being overweight or with obesity,” Winfrey continued. “I come to this conversation with the hope that we can start releasing the stigma and the shame and the judgment – to stop shaming other people for being overweight or how they choose to lose or not lose weight – and more importantly to stop shaming ourselves.”The program featured several guests who shared their personal experiences with obesity and weight management. Winfrey, too, shared the pain she has felt at times in her weight journey.“I took on the shame that the world gave to me. For 25 years, making fun of my weight was national sport,” she said.Winfrey described the relief she felt when she finally came to understand obesity as a disease.“When I tell you how many times I have blamed myself,” Winfrey said, choking up in conversation with a young woman in the audience. “You think I’m smart enough to figure this out and then to hear, all along it’s you fighting your brain.”W. Scott Butsch, Director of Obesity Medicine in the Bariatric and Metabolic Institute at the Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Amanda Velazquez, an obesity expert at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, were among the medical experts who participated in the special.“There’s a spectrum of obesity. It’s not one disease, it’s many different subtypes of disease,” Butsch said. “It’s not a matter of willpower.”The medical experts addressed potential side effects of weight loss medications and factors and risks that should be considered before taking it as part of a multiifaceted care plan.Winfrey spoke about her use of weight loss medication as one “tool” to manage her weight, combined with hiking, running, weight resistance training and eating a healthy diet.“It’s not just one thing, it’s multiple things,” Winfrey said.At the conclusion of the program, Winfrey acknowledged people who may feel “happy and healthy” living in a bigger body, those who feel diet and exercise are “the best and only way” to lose excess weight, and those interested in learning more about how medications may help in weight loss.“There is space for all points of view,” Winfrey said at the end of the program. “Let’s stop the shaming and blaming. There’s no place for it.”"

        "title": "‘Ricky Stanicky’ gives John Cena and Zac Efron a chance to flex their comedy muscles",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Playfully letting John Cena flex his comedy muscles, “Ricky Stanicky” works from an amusing premise that owes an unlikely debt to a 51-year-old “MASH” episode, in which an imaginary character must be brought to life. Also serving as a reunion of Zac Efron and director Peter Farrelly, the execution yields an only fitfully funny R-rated comedy, a genre that’s found a receptive platform via Amazon.Like seemingly all friendship-based comedies, this one begins with a flashback, as a trio of boys get into trouble and desperately blame what happened on “Ricky Stanicky,” a made-up kid.Jump to the present day, and Dean (Efron) along with his pals JT (“Dave’s” Andrew Santino) and Wes (Jermaine Fowler) are still invoking the name – in much the way “MASH’s” Hawkeye did with “Captain Tuttle” – although here, mostly to get away for guys weekends or escape situations they’d rather avoid, such as a baby shower. Feeling smug about the ruse, they wryly toast Stanicky as “The best friend we never had.”As it happens, their latest juvenile escapade takes them to Atlantic City, where they meet an odd lounge-entertainer type who goes by the name “Rock Hard” Rod (Cena), right before the ruse blows up in their faces. Forced to produce Stanicky after using him as their excuse, Dean has the bright idea of hiring Rod to portray Stanicky at a bris for JT’s baby.Not surprisingly given the film’s below-the-belt bent, a circumcision gag follows, while Rod has to vamp his way through all the fabulous attributes the trio have ascribed to Stanicky through the years.Although Rod has dutifully studied the “bible” they’ve assembled, that sets up plenty of highly awkward moments to keep misleading both their romantic partners and Dean and JT’s boss (William H. Macy, getting into the silly spirit).After winning a much-debated Oscar with “Green Book,” Farrelly collaborated with Efron on another streaming movie, 2022’s “The Greatest Beer Run Ever.” “Ricky Stanicky” shifts closer to the sort of raunchy comedic fare for which Farrelly was known when working with brother Bobby on movies like “There’s Something About Mary.”Usually crediting a script to six writers (Farrelly being one of them) isn’t a particularly good sign – and the film does have a sitcom-writers-room feel about it – yet there are some reasonably good laughs peppered throughout, as well as a darker, more serious side about Dean’s difficult childhood that feels too incongruous with the movie’s overall tone.While edgier comedies have found the sledding fairly difficult at the box office of late (“Anyone But You” being a notable exception), Amazon has exhibited a fondness for the genre, including the recent Snoop Dogg vehicle “The Underdoggs.”Like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cena has smartly taken advantage of his tough-guy physique to carve a path into broad comedy, from the DC series “Peacemaker” to “Blockers,” “Trainwreck” and “Playing with Fire.” “Ricky Stanicky” might be imaginary and doesn’t measure up to its promise, but in terms of that basket within the wrestler-turned-actor’s filmography, it at least fits Cena like a glove.“Ricky Stanicky” premieres March 7 on Amazon’s Prime Video. It’s rated R."

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "In romantic comedies, casual sex isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and the commitment-phobic eventually see the error of their ways. The Netflix movie “Players” follows that basic playbook, but the fun is in getting there, thanks largely to Gina Rodriguez as the leader of a gang of friends who operate like a “Mission: Impossible”-type team for the purpose of orchestrating one-night stands.Nobody should expect too much of a movie in this genre released on Valentine’s Day, and grading on that curve, “Players” happily punches above its weight class and exceeds expectations.Rodriguez’s Mack and her longtime buddies (played by Damon Wayans Jr., Augustus Prew and Joel Courtney) hang out together until it’s time to leap into action and “run a play,” employing one of several tried-and-true methods they’ve developed in order to arrange random hookups.By day, they work for a newspaper where Mack works as a sportswriter, and, in what’s definitely a sign of the times, stresses about whether the next round of layoffs might catch up with her.Before you can say “Boomerang,” though, Mack meets dashing author Nick (“Lucifer’s” Tom Ellis), and tumbles into bed with him, only later deciding that she wants to try and have an actual relationship with him. (“Mission accomplished” would mean being offered a drawer in his apartment for her stuff, which owes a small debt to another movie from this well-worn genre, “About Last Night.”)Although initially horrified that Mack would try to parlay their encounter into a deeper relationship after running a “play,” her buddies join in her elaborate scheme to woo Nick, and one of them, Adam (Wayans), even wonders aloud whether it’s “time to be adults” – a signal that their life of easy hookups might be coming to an end.Of course, nothing’s ever as simple as that, and director Trish Sie (“Pitch Perfect 3” and the more recent “Sitting in Bars With Cake”) and writer Whit Anderson throw in hurdles and wrinkles. Fortunately, Rodriguez spent five seasons trying to figure out who she should be with on “Jane the Virgin,” so she’s got plenty of experience dealing with that particular conundrum.“Players” isn’t here to carve out any new ground, merely to cover familiar territory as pleasantly as possible. And as Mack or any other sportswriter could tell you, when calling a basic play, success really boils down to execution and making the right calls.“Players” premieres February 14 on Netflix."

        "title": "‘Spaceman’ launches Adam Sandler into a heavy-handed sci-fi drama",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Adam Sandler’s deal with Netflix means pretty much doing whatever he wants, which, in the case of “Spaceman,” means traveling to the furthest reaches of space as the near-solitary star of a pretentious, message-heavy drama. Violating “Seinfeld’s” “No hugging, no learning” rule, the concept holds some interest for a time but runs out fuel before reaching home.Adapted from Jaroslav Kalfař’s novel titled “Spaceman of Bohemia” by director Johan Renck (an Emmy winner for “Chernobyl”) and writer Colby Day, the film features Sandler as a Czech astronaut named Jakub, having spent more than six months journeying to take samples of a mysterious space cloud. Yet while mission control tries to keep him focused on matters at hand – and underwrites the venture by having Jakub, a celebrity back home, read ads for things like anti-nausea medication – all is not well back on Earth.Indeed, Jakub has noticed that his wife, Lenka (Carey Mulligan, between this and “Maestro,” the VIP of under-appreciated wives in Netflix movies), has stopped sending messages, and he’s fretting about the strained nature of their relationship. He’s right to worry, since Lenka wants to end things, a revelation that the leader of the space agency (Isabella Rossellini) is reluctant to share, lest it distract Jakub from the mission.Before Jakub can reach his objective, though, he receives an unexpected visitor in the form of a wise alien with a soothing voice (provided by Paul Dano, who excels at this sort of creepiness) that belies its unsettling appearance.After getting over his initial shock, Jakub begins to build a relationship with the alien, whom he names Hanuš. The extreterrstrial takes an inordinate interest in details of the life of this “skinny human,” and especially his relationship with his mate. The why of that stays a bit murky, but the thrust involves the not-terribly-subtle lesson that we sometimes have to go far away to realize what’s really important and that there’s no place like home, Auntie Em.After playing a supporting role in “You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah” – a showcase for his daughters – and scratching his sports itch with “Hustle,” Sandler seems to relish this dramatic turn as the pained astronaut, driven professionally to the point of jeopardizing his marriage. The actor has exhibited plenty of range, but one suspects Netflix would much prefer his next endeavor tilt closer to “Murder Mystery” territory.While there’s a fair amount of “Gravity” in the outer-space trappings and the way Sandler has to hold the screen, “Spaceman” feels a little too weighty in its reliance on emotional cliches. Whether that’s ultimately due to the underlying material or the heavy hand brought to translating it, the net effect is a failure to launch.“Spaceman” premieres February 23 in select theaters and March 1 on Netflix. It’s rated R."

        "title": "‘Apples Never Fall’ grows from the twisty roots of a Liane Moriarty mystery",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "After “Big Little Lies” and “Nine Perfect Strangers,” author Liane Moriarty has graduated to the point where nearly everything she’s put on paper will likely be adapted for the screen, really just boiling down to execution. The latest, “Apples Never Fall,” provides a healthy dollop of “Big Little Lies” energy, thanks in part to an excellent cast headed by Sam Neill and Annette Bening.Like most of Moriarty’s stories, this one deals with a mystery within a mystery, jumping around in time (labeling those sequences “then” and “now”) while shifting perspectives from episode to episode among the various characters. At seven chapters, this Peacock production has the advantage of being the rare limited series that milks the premise without overdoing it.The show focuses on the Delaney family, presided over by accomplished tennis coaches Stan (Neill) and his wife Joy (Bening), whose tutelage of young players included some of their four children, played by Alison Brie, Jake Lacy, Conor Merrigan-Turner, and Essie Randles.Yet as Stan and Joy retire, they’re soon interrupted by a young woman, Savannah (Australian actor Georgia Flood), in need of refuge from what she describes as an abusive boyfriend.To the chagrin of the kids and eventually Stan, Savannah essentially moves in, becoming a valuable aide, companion and even de facto daughter to Joy, before Joy goes missing, which triggers both a mad hunt for her and suspicions around Stan, whose temper and past bad behavior gradually drips back through the course of the flashbacks.Then again, that’s just one of the family secrets uncovered as the search continues, fraying relationships that were already pretty fragile, with plenty of old wounds, squandered opportunities and resentment just below the surface.As adapted by showrunner Melanie Marnich (whose recent credits include Hulu’s less effective “A Murder at the End of the World”), “Apples Never Fall” deftly dribbles out clues, fostering uncertainty about what happened while building toward a conclusion that’s not as satisfying as it should be, but good enough.Mostly, the show serves as a worthy binge and a solid showcase for the stars – including Bening, coming off an Oscar nomination for “Nyad” – with the one disclaimer being that it probably won’t garner the same level of attention on Peacock as it might have on another streaming platform.“Apples Never Fall” also reinforces a sense that Moriarty’s books are particularly well suited to the popular limited-series format, a case of fortuitous timing. It’s often wryly noted that in tennis, “love” means “nothing,” but it means something here. As for the old expression “How do you like them apples?,” in this case, happily, the answer is quite a lot.“Apples Never Fall” premieres March 14 on Peacock."

        "title": "Let ‘Dune: Part Two’ inspire you to revisit these other timeless sci-fi sequels",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "“Dune: Part Two” is landing in theaters this weekend, and the movie is already a promising franchise hit, with (to date) an impressive 94% critical rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and an audience score one percentage point higher.After 2021’s first entry fared similarly well – and picked up a total of six Academy Awards – the zeitgeist is inevitably comparing director Denis Villeneuve’s sprawling world of “Dune” to those of “Star Wars” and “Lord of the Rings.” With that said, there’s no time like the present to use Arrakis, the desert planet at the heart of “Dune,” as the jumping-off point to explore other amazing sequels in science-fiction, a genre that’s luckily been fertile ground for various second chapters in cinema.Behold, a list of some the most notable, in no particular order.What better way to start off than with one of the greatest sequels – and sci-fi films in general – ever made, with a screenplay that’s been taught in film schools. James Cameron’s Oscar-winning followup to Ridley Scott’s haunted-house-in-space classic from 1979 broke the mold in many ways, from its deft ability to develop every member of the ensemble cast of mercenaries to the heart-wrenching crux of the story, Ellen Ripley’s (Sigourney Weaver) fiercely protective and maternal relationship with a young survivor named Newt (Carrie Henn). And that’s not to mention the absolutely iconic face-off between Ripley and another maternal figure in the movie – namely the horrifying Alien Queen, as seen above.A groundbreaking achievement in terms of special effects and world-building at the time, “Star Trek II” was a sequel no one saw coming, as it felt very different from the troubled first feature film based on the historic television series. From early use of CGI to full-throttle performances from both heroic William Shatner and villainous Ricardo Montalban, “Khan” stands the test of time – especially with that whopper of an ending.James Cameron (yes, he’s been referred to as the king of sequels) struck cinematic sequel gold again with his awe-inspiring revisit of a world fated to be dominated by evil killer robots, and the few people – along with a now friendly cyborg in Arnold Schwarzenegger’s most unforgettable performance – who stand in the way. Among its many, many credits, including a truly badass turn from Linda Hamilton as a stronger and more resilient Sarah Connor – the second “Terminator” also marked a massive leap forward for CGI effects, helping to lay the groundwork for “Jurassic Park” and beyond.After a bold new beginning in 2011’s “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” this sequel raised the stakes in this rebooted franchise that finally had the incredible special effects to back up an idea first planted with the 1968 original. Featuring Andy Serkis in top form as ape leader Caesar, “Dawn” builds to an explosive crescendo anchored by chilling post-apocalyptic visions and real emotion, as viewers are confronted with the true nature of what it means to be human. A fourth entry to the series, “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” is out this summer.In the post-apocalyptic space, it doesn’t get any more bonkers than the world of Mad Max, which has seen several sequels reinvent and build upon what came before in truly eye-popping fashion. Franchise mastermind George Miller’s second entry “The Road Warrior” took the ingredients from his gritty first outing and crystallized them into a superb sequel, while the third installment remains memorable if for no other reason than Tina Turner’s unbelievable appearance as the menacing Auntie Entity. Thirty years later, the Tom Hardy- and Charlize Theron-led reboot “Fury Road” showed just how many new mind-bending possibilities there were for this world. Miller is at work on not one but two new installments, including an origin story for Theron’s Furiosa starring Anya Taylor-Joy.While this franchise borders on both the supernatural and comedy genres, it deserves a place on this list for being an inventive and under-appreciated sequel that took the elements from the original “Ghostbusters” and ran with them. Giving more room for performers including Annie Potts, Rick Moranis, Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver to play – not to mention a truly madcap performance from Peter MacNicol as an outlandish museum employee-turned-possessed demon, sometimes in drag – “Ghostbusters II” still brings the chills as well as the fun, giving new meaning to the idea of “feel-good music” thanks to the prominent placement of “(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher” as sung by Howard Huntsberry.Truly and deservedly the “father” of all sequels, “Empire” blew the spaceship door off the “Star Wars ” franchise and is most likely the reason it has not only lasted this long, but become a perennial element in pop culture the world over. Its blueprint for deepening the story and expanding the characters has been followed – but never bested – by many a sequel since, including “Dune: Part Two” (the source material of which, it must be said, served as a heavy influence for George Lucas when he was first conceiving his “Star Wars” universe). If for no other reason, the decision to end “Empire” on not only a cliffhanger, but a down note at that, is a daring move few franchises have ever attempted, “Dune” among them.“Dune: Part Two” is produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, which, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery."

She returned to portray the hardy nemesis to the Ghostface killer in four of the slasher franchise’s sequels, most recently in 2022’s fifth installment, also titled “Scream.”Her character was notably absent, however, from last year’s “Scream VI,” which was reportedly due at least in part to a salary dispute.She told Variety in June 2022 that she felt the offer to appear in the sequel “did not equate to the value” she’s brought to the franchise as its principal star.She made reference to her “Scream VI” negotiations in her post Tuesday, writing, “I’m very happy and proud to say I’ve been asked, in the most respectful way, to bring Sidney back to the screen and I couldn’t be more thrilled!”Campbell discussed her absence from “Scream VI,” which starred Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega, at an event in January. She told Indiewire at the time, “I just really felt the need to stand up and say that I don’t think I would have been treated that way if I was a man carrying a franchise for 25 years.”Original “Scream” scribe Williamson will be directing the seventh installment, according to the script shown on Campbell’s social media.“This was (Williamson’s) baby and it’s his brilliant mind that dreamt up this world. Kevin is not just an inspiration as an artist but has been a dear friend for many years,” the “Party of Five” star added.Williamson has one previous directing credit, for 1999’s Katie Holmes-starring thriller “Teaching Mrs. Tingle” featuring Helen Mirren.The “Scream” movies make up one of the bestselling horror franchises in history, with the first film – costarring Drew Barrymore, Courteney Cox and Rose McGowan – becoming a cultural reference point and inspiration for many horror films to follow.The most recent installment, set in New York City, made over $165 million at the box office globally in 2023.

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Tom Hollander is just the latest actor to portray the late writer Truman Capote, and that legacy all but added to the pressure.Hollander told CNN in a recent interview that he was more than familiar with Phillip Seymour Hoffman’s Oscar-winning portrayal of the writer in the 2005 film “Capote,” as well as that of Toby Jones in 2006’s “Infamous.”As a matter of fact, Hollander said, he had auditioned for the part Jones ended up getting back in the mid-aughts, and went back to watch some of Jones’ and Hoffman’s performances “to reassure myself that I could, that there was something left for me to do.”“I realized that (my performance) would be distinct. I would be doing my own version,” Hollander said. “One of (Capote’s) legacies, I suppose, is to be so extraordinary as a character that different actors all get to play him at different times. Because there are different ways of telling his story.”The diminutive Capote, with his distinctive voice and penchant for gossip, is at the center of FX’s anthology series “Feud: Capote vs. The Swans,” which airs its final episode Thursday.“This is a story, Truman and the Swans, that has not been told before,” the “White Lotus” actor said. “And so we were dealing with different stuff from either of those films.”“Feud” tells the story of “In Cold Blood” writer Capote and the socialites in his life he called his “Swans” in 1960s New York City.Ryan Murphy – who is behind the fashion and style-heavy project – brought in some major players for the series, from Gus Van Sant as director of six episodes to an all-star cast which included Chloë Sevigny, Diane Lane, Calista Flockhart, Molly Ringwald, Demi Moore, Naomi Watts and the late Treat Williams.Hollander declined to name his “favorite swan,” instead hailing all the women for their performances as the group who turned on Capote after he revealed their secrets in a thinly disguised roman à clef.But he did say he and Watts have grown close given the many scenes they shared portraying the incredibly involved, and sometimes toxic, relationship between Capote and Watts’ character Babe Paley.“We sort of had to because we were, as Babe and Truman, so close and that’s such an important part of the story,” Hollander said. “So we spent time together before we shot. She was incredibly welcoming and kind and invited me over before we started shooting.”Another cast member Hollander developed a deep affection for was Treat Williams.In June 2023 Williams was hit and killed while motorcycling in his home state of Vermont. He was 71.Hollander called the accident “a pointless bit of life tragedy where you just go, well, why does that have to happen to a man who was just the warmest, most generous, most delightful?”Williams was thrilled with the role of media magnate William S. Paley, his costar said.“He had been doing stuff that hadn’t been particularly fulfilling him,” Hollander said. “He was loving (the role as Bill Paley), a great part, which he was playing brilliantly.”Such richness of character is something Hollander has also enjoyed himself about “Feud.”His Capote is one who is spiraling from both alcoholism and the loss of the friendships that had meant so much to him. Hollander digs his teeth into every scene, from Capote spouting the rapier wit that the writer used to bring down more than a few, to cooking in his Manhattan apartment.So what would Hollander, who is known to be a talent in the kitchen in real life, cook for Capote if he could?The question illicits a smile and a chuckle from the actor.“I like cooking for my family and for friends when they come,” he said. “I wouldn’t want to cook for a difficult celebrity drunk writer that who could turn at any moment.”Sounds like sage advice.“Feud: Capote vs. The Swans” is streaming on Hulu."

        "title": "Marcello Gandini, designer of the world’s most famous supercar, dies at 85",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Look at almost any modern high-horsepower supercar and you will see the work of auto designer Marcello Gandini. Sharp lines, a low stance, doors that swing up; all were influenced by Gandini’s seminal work, the Lamborghini Countach.The Countach and its predecessor, the Lamborghini Miura, are widely regarded as the first modern supercars, creating the template for a vehicle category that still marks the pinnacle in automotive performance and design. Gandini designed both of those cars and, if he had done nothing else, he would still be remembered.But in addition to his work for Lamborghini, Gandini produced cars for automakers including BMW, Fiat and Ferrari. He designed rally racing cars, economy hatchbacks (such as the first Volkswagen Polo and the Renault Supercinq, a follow up the Renault 5), concept cars and at least one helicopter.He died Wednesday at the age of 85 in Turin, Italy, the city where he was born and where — throughout his career at the Gruppo Bertone design studio and, later, his own firm — he worked much of his auto design magic.Gandini’s radical, sharp-edged Countach was designed as a replacement for the Lamborghini Miura, a car with curved edges and rows of black “eyelashes” around its circular headlights. While the Miura was considered one of the most beautiful cars ever made, it was not radical — rather, it was the perfection of sports car design up to that time. The Countach, unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in 1971, meanwhile, was angular and sharp-edged like shattered crystal.“Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but nothing better has been done since,” Gandini said of the Countach during a 2019 interview with CNN at Museo Nazionale dell’Automobile, Italy’s National Automobile Museum in Turin.Before the Countach came the Lancia Statos HF Zero in 1970. Looking at that sportscar, it’s almost hard to imagine that it is, in fact, a drivable automobile. Instead of doors, the cabin is entered through an upward swinging windshield. When driving, rear visibility is afforded by a temporary rearview mirror that attaches to the nearly horizontal windshield. (Rear visibility in the first Countach models was through a periscope built into the roof.)Gandini’s interest in automobiles started with machinery rather than design. When he was five years old his father bought him a Meccano set, the metal building toy known as an Erector Set in the United States. Children could build cars, airplanes and machines with thin metal sheets and bars held together by tiny nuts and bolts.At 18, Gandini became a mechanic. A wealthy friend with a Fiat OSCA 1500S he liked to race asked Gandini to work on its engine. Gandini decided to alter the car’s body as well, a project that became his entrance into automotive design.“I always loved things that moved,” Gandini said. “Not static objects. They never attracted me.”In 1965 he joined the Turin-based auto design firm Gruppo Bertone, replacing the famous and highly influential Giorgetto Giugiaro. Gandini’s first project, a body that went over a Porsche 911’s chassis and engine, was exhibited at the 1966 Geneva Motor Show. That car was sold at a Gooding & Co. auction in Pebble Beach, California, for $1.4 million in 2018.“Gandini was not just a designer; he was a visionary, whose skill and creativity redefined the aesthetic standards of sports and luxury cars, influencing generations of designers and enthusiasts,” Bertone wrote in a tribute posted Wednesday on its official Instagram page.The starting point for all his designs, Gandini said, was purpose. Each suited a need.Prototypes, or concept cars, were his favorites, though, he said. They gave Gandini the opportunity to create entirely new automotive forms. He loved the opportunity to start from a clean sheet of paper. And, in these cases, the need was simple.“When we are talking about a prototype,” he told CNN in 2019, “The most important thing is to create a sensation. As much sensation as possible.”"

        "category": "style",
        "text": "The disastrous Willy Wonka-inspired experience held in Glasgow, Scotland, last month has already been immortalized in an endless stream of meme-orabilia that will forever live on a corner of the internet.And now, some of the physical memorabilia that provided sparse decoration for the event’s venue has been preserved for an Ebay auction, where bids for it are already fetching almost $1,000.Monorail Music, an independent record store based in Glasgow, is selling three of the backdrops that were hung in an attempt to decorate the warehouse, after they were salvaged from the trash by a friend of Michael Kasparis, the store’s online manager.“He has a workshop underneath the venue that hosted the Willy Wonka experience and… the day after everything blew up, he was just at the bins and saw all this stuff lying there,” Kasparis told CNN Wednesday.“He thought ‘I’ll just take it’ and was joking to me and some other friends he had this… but then he said some good should come of it and we suggested that Monorail auction it for Medical Aid for Palestinians,” Kasparis added.Despite having a starting price of £10 ($13), the three backdrops have already fetched 48 bids on Ebay, including a highest one of £760 ($973) as of Wednesday morning. The bidding is set to end on Thursday at 3:10 p.m. local time (11:10 a.m. ET).“I’m anticipating getting into four figures,” Kasparis said, “which is what I’m hoping for.”A hastily handmade sign announcing the event’s cancellation was also sold last week by Box Hub – the venue that hosted the viral experience – for £840 ($1,075), with 80% of the proceeds donated to Glasgow Children’s Hospital Charity.“All comedy aside, we understand that many children and families were left disappointed after travelling from across the country for this event,” Box Hub said in an Instagram post on March 1. “We’d like to see some good from this.”Photos from the Willy Wonka-inspired event, with its quarter cups of lemonade handed out to each child, minimal decorations and actors dressed as Oompa Loompas, were endlessly memed across social media, even making its way into British politics when the opposition Labour Party jumped in on the fun.Two of the backdrops being sold by the record store depict a colorful candyland while another black and white one was used to create a “Time Tunnel,” the lot said, but they all look nothing like the fantastical images that had been used to advertise the event.Frustrated with that gap between the advertising and reality, families attending the experience became so angry that the police were called, and the event was eventually canceled.Organizer House of Illuminati said in its latest Facebook post that the “fallout from this event has been heart-wrenching,” adding that it was continuing to refund tickets, after apologizing multiple times in previous posts."

        "text": "Charter jets for tycoons and celebrities, a performance by Rihanna and directions to don “jungle fever” outfits when visiting an animal rescue center — that’s how billionaire Mukesh Ambani is kickstarting big fat Indian wedding celebrations for his son.The head of Indian conglomerate Reliance and Asia’s richest man with a net worth of $114 billion according to Forbes, Ambani is known for never doing a party by halves.The occasion of the moment that has India transfixed is a three-day pre-wedding jamboree for his youngest son Anant Ambani, 28, who is set to marry his long-time girlfriend Radhika Merchant, 29. It begins Friday, will entertain 1,200 guests and takes place in a township in Jamnagar near Reliance’s main oil refinery in the western state of Gujarat.The wedding itself does not take place until July and festivities de facto began on Wednesday when Anant and his bride-to-be hosted a communal dinner for local villagers that served 51,000.In addition to pop and R&B superstar Rihanna, US magician David Blaine will perform and there will also be traditional ceremonies in a temple complex.Anant’s pre-wedding bash is likely to be attended by Bill Gates, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, fellow Indian billionaires Gautam Adani and Kumar Mangalam Birla, as well as many cricketers and Bollywood film stars such as Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the plans who declined to be identified.Also likely to attend is Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, which announced a $8.5 billion merger of its India media assets with Reliance’s on Wednesday.Anant is a director at Reliance’s new energy business and one of Ambani’s three children who are the heirs to his empire. Merchant is a director at India’s Encore Healthcare.Ambani also made headlines with his daughter Isha’s wedding in 2018 which was described by some as a mini-Davos summit. Former U.S. Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among those who hit the dance floor with Bollywood stars back then.Guests to Anant Ambani’s celebrations are set to savor 500 dishes created by around 100 chefs.They will be pampered — hair styling, makeup artists and Indian wear drapists are available but only on a “first come, first serve basis,” according to a planning document provided to invitees and seen by Reuters.They will visit a rescue center that Reliance says is home to more than 2,000 animals and has one of the world’s largest elephant hospitals. The dress code is “jungle fever” with guests advised to wear animal print clothing or Hawaiian shirts.Return charter jet flights from New Delhi and Mumbai are on offer, but guests have been asked to limit themselves to only two luggage items or three suitcases per couple. The document cautions that “if you bring more,” there’s no guarantee it will arrive on the same flight.Guests have also been asked to be reasonable in their expectations for laundry services.“Any clothes given to steam (press) will be returned within 3 hours… expecting or requesting anything quicker than that may not be feasible,” it said."

        "title": "New sanctions on Russian diamonds will change the global trade in gems",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "After close to two years of conflict, the global diamond market is set to feel the full consequences of the war in Ukraine.The European Union earlier this month added the world’s biggest diamond producer, Russia’s Alrosa, to its sanctions list alongside its CEO, Pavel Alekseevich Marinychev. The new year marked the start of an escalating series of export restrictions on Russian stones coordinated with the G7, which includes the US, UK, Canada and Japan, as well as EU members France, Germany and Italy.Though some countries had already imposed their own sanctions, figuring out a comprehensive system to effectively police the market proved challenging; diamond traders in Antwerp, the Belgian port city that serves as a major trading hub for the precious stones, had lobbied to slow restrictions on the lucrative business. But now that a sanctions scheme has been agreed, it stands to push through seismic changes in the way the diamond industry operates, imposing new requirements for transparency and traceability in a sector that has historically operated with little of either.“These sanctions have been in the works for two years now and it took this long because it’s that challenging to come up with a framework that everyone in the industry can effectively adhere to,” said diamond industry analyst Paul Zimnisky.Though the US and UK banned direct imports of rough diamonds from Russia shortly after the war began, stones cut and polished elsewhere in the world had remained fair game — until now.But as of the start of January, EU and G7 countries have banned the direct purchase of non-industrial diamonds from Russia. This move will be followed by further restrictions on the import of Russian diamonds processed in third countries starting in March. And come September, diamonds sold within the powerful group of countries will need to adhere to a certification scheme to verify where they came from. In Europe, jewelry and watches containing diamonds will be included too.In other words, even if stones are sent halfway around the world for cutting and polishing, if they originated in Russia they’ll be banned from markets in Europe and the G7. And the industry will need to figure out how to prove it.No one seems to really know yet. Diamond supply chains are long and complicated, with stones typically passing through dozens of hands in multiple countries before making it to market.Keeping track of where stones originated while navigating this web of hard-to-police middlemen is notoriously difficult. That’s particularly true for the smaller diamonds Russia is known for producing, which are typically sold in large quantities and often mixed with other stones from other places.So far, the EU and G7 have only painted a broad outline of their plans for a system to trace and verify stones’ origins, with a pilot system set to be operational at the beginning of March. Industry groups including the World Diamond Council, Antwerp World Diamond Centre, the Gem and Jewellery Export Council of India and the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) have been working together to develop an effective solution.“It’s a bit of a work in progress,” said Morgane Winterholer, general manager of strategic brands and sustainability diamond manufacturer Dimexon. “At the moment it is extremely important that the roadmap needs to be developed.”Technology could help. The GIA is able to triangulate data gathered from a rough stone and match it to finished diamonds, but still relies on documentation of where the stone came from to begin with. De Beers has developed a blockchain based traceability system known as Tracr, while other companies are developing their own offerings.But none of these solutions are operating at scale and there’s currently no scientific method to trace a diamond right back to the mine.The new sanctions will dramatically accelerate efforts to build traceability into the diamond industry, in a way that will restructure supply chains that stretch around the world.Big businesses have been preparing for the change. LVMH-owned Tiffany and Richemont both said they stopped sourcing Russian stones shortly after the war in Ukraine broke out. Dimexon has segregated its supply chain to ensure Russian stones don’t reach Western clients, tracking each transaction and relying on direct commercial relationships with mining companies to demonstrate the origin of each package of stones.These changes have market ramifications too. Russia accounts for roughly one third of the world’s diamond supply, but while Russian stones will likely still end up sparkling in engagement rings, necklaces and tennis bracelets bought by consumers in places outside of the new sanctions regime, the countries that will adhere to the diamond ban account for nearly three quarters of global jewelry demand, according to Zimnisky.“In the medium- to longer-term, there will be times the industry runs into supply shortages because of this,” he said.This article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

        "text": "An awards ceremony curveball indeed: Emma Stone, winner of the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in “Poor Things,” dealt with a sartorial snafu just moments before she took the stage to accept her trophy.“My dress is broken,” Stone appeared to mouth while en route to receive her Academy Award. Once on stage, she opened her acceptance speech with an acknowledgment of the wardrobe malfunction, which appeared to be a broken zipper or seam on the back of her Louis Vuitton gown.“I think it happened during ‘I’m Just Ken,’” she explained, referencing Ryan Gosling’s performance of his song from the “Barbie” movie — and, presumably, some dance moves she’d indulged in (because who wouldn’t boogie down with Gosling should the opportunity present itself?).Speaking to reporters backstage, Stone said she had been “going for it” during Gosling’s performance, adding: “I was so amazed by Ryan and what he was doing, and that number just blew my mind.”“They sewed me back in, which was wonderful,” she also revealed.Stone, now a two-time Oscar winner, had earlier wowed the red carpet outside the Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre in her custom strapless Vuitton look, which featured a flared peplum waist and shell-like detailing. The actor was dressed by top fashion and celebrity stylist Petra Flannery.Stone won her first Oscar in 2017 for her role in “La La Land,” a movie that co-starred Gosling — and, in fact, the pair shared the microphone for a few lines during Gosling’s “I’m Just Ken” showcase tonight.In this year’s Best Actress category, she was up against Lily Gladstone of “Killers of the Flower Moon,” Annette Bening of “Nyad,” Carey Mulligan of “Maestro” and Sandra Hüller of “Anatomy of a Fall.”Stone is also in illustrious company when it comes to fashion mishaps at the Oscars: In a 2022 interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Charlize Theron recounted that the ruched back seams of the Vera Wang gown she wore to the 2000 Oscars ripped as she took her seat. “When I stood up for the first standing ovation, I felt this kind of cool breeze coming up my tush,” she said. “And I realized my whole butt was hanging out.”In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, actor Jenny Slate spoke of a similar moment when she joined her co-stars “Everything Everywhere All at Once” on stage at last year’s Oscars, saying that she “waddled” on-stage to stop anyone noticing a ripped seam on her Thom Browne gown. And perhaps most infamously, Jennifer Lawrence, who was on stage with Stone tonight (as one of the former Best Actress winners who introduced this year’s nominees), took a tumble when accepting her Oscar for Best Actress in 2013 due to the hemline on her cascading Dior Haute Couture gown.Lawrence, along with the other former winners, helped usher Stone off-stage."

        "title": "Lusail Towers: Norman Foster on how to ‘reinvent the tall building’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Lord Norman Foster, renowned as one of the world’s foremost architects, has dedicated decades to redefining the concept of tall buildings. His portfolio boasts iconic structures such as London’s 30 St Mary Axe (better known to Londoners as the “Gherkin”) and the HSBC building in Hong Kong. Now, he’s set his sights on Qatar.Currently nearing completion and set to reach a height of 301 meters (988 feet), Foster’s Lusail Towers are poised to claim the title of Qatar’s tallest buildings, surpassing the current record holder, The Torch Doha.Part of a 1.1 million-square-meter project conceived by Foster + Partners, the towers’ construction is a pivotal component of the larger masterplan for the city of Lusail, situated 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of the capital, Doha.Breaking ground in January 2020, the Lusail Towers stand amidst a plethora of new developments in the area, including Lusail Stadium, also designed by Foster + Partners for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Comprising four distinctive blocks, two standing at 70 stories and two at 50 stories, each tower is intended to serve as a hub for Qatar’s financial institutions.“As an architect, I find myself engaging with cities in their infancy,” Foster said. “We’ve made a mark for what is essentially a new district, laying down infrastructure for future generations.”To address the unique challenges presented by Qatar’s hot climate, Foster’s team had to depart from the materials commonly used in skyscrapers in cooler countries – part of what Foster called a decades-long quest to “reinvent the tall building.”“You think so many times of the tower being a glass tower, but (with) the whole climate here and the issue of sustainability … you really want to defend against solar gain,” he added.The design incorporates advanced shading and ventilation, while the towers’ exteriors are coated with “marine-grade” aluminum that wraps around the buildings, protecting the glass from strong sunlight while maintaining the views and still letting in natural light.Central to the project are special shading fins, akin to gills, which not only optimize views and natural lighting for occupants but reduce solar radiation by 70% compared to traditional all-glass towers.“What we’ve done here is create a sense of identity drawn from real needs,” Foster said. “It’s not a fashionable imposition, it’s generated from the realities of the climate.”According to Luke Fox, project lead and senior executive partner at Foster + Partners, this shading system contributes to a 35% reduction in cooling requirements and overall energy consumption.The towers are strategically placed to create maximum shading, and as they rise their shape shifts by rotating 90 degrees.“We made sure that the towers were deliberately placed to rotate slightly, providing perspectives between them as they rise above ground level. It’s quite unique. They appear as distinct entities,” Fox said.While the towers are poised to become a recognizable landmark for Lusail, Foster believes that a city’s skyline reflects what lies beneath the surface. He says it was crucial for his team to integrate the towers into a “low-scale master plan.”They are strategically positioned on top of a metro line and at the end of a commercial boulevard linking the waterfront to the nearby football stadium, which recently hosted the final of AFC Asian Cup.According to Foster, the ground features of the plaza will be instrumental in the overarching objective of transforming the area into a vibrant public space for the future.“What isn’t always apparent from those distant views is the pedestrian experience. It’s the lower infrastructure that binds these diverse elements together,” Foster said.The Lusail Towers are set to be completed in phases over the next 12 months."

        "title": "This photo of male intimacy in 1980s India was more subversive than it seems",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "To passersby, the sight of two men embracing besides New Delhi’s India Gate in 1986 might have seemed unremarkable. In a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace, it was photographer Sunil Gupta who attracted more attention at the time.“Men holding hands or lying in each other’s laps is not an issue — it looks very romantic from (the outside), but they’re usually just hanging out,” he said in a video interview from the UK, before recalling: “I was creating more interest than them, because I was standing there with a tripod and a camera, so everybody was focused on me.”Onlookers may not have realized, but Gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he has described as the “repressive atmosphere” of 1980s India. At a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today — and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an “unnatural offense” — the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting Delhi’s gay scene. The pair in question had chosen the war monument’s gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot.Having lived in New Delhi until his mid-teens, London-based Gupta knew this from personal experience. “I passed that place on my way to school every day for 11 years,” he said. “You just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home. It was very easy.”The image forms part of the photographer’s series “Exiles,” which was first exhibited in the UK in 1987 but is this week showing at the India Art Fair in New Delhi. Primarily shot outdoors around India’s capital, it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners, their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera.Concerned about “outing” his subjects, Gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a “constructed documentary” approach. After shooting his images and developing the film in London, he returned to Delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show.“There was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures,” he said of the India Gate shoot. “And there were other photos that were (more suggestive)… So I picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series.”The other ethical challenge, he recalled, was communicating to the duo how the images would be used — and the art of photography itself.“It wasn’t for publication, and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine, so it took some explaining,” he said, adding: “Then I tried to explain the process.”Photography for many at the time, Gupta observed, was still “a very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom.”Now among India’s most celebrated photographic artists, Gupta often addressed LGBTQ experiences in his explorations of race, immigration and identity. While studying in the US in the mid-1970s he produced a now-celebrated series of photos from New York’s Christopher Street that captured the city’s gay scene in the years between the Stonewall Riots and onset of the AIDS epidemic.Although “Exiles” presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the West, Gupta’s intended audience was always back in London. Homophobia was rife in 1980s Britain, and the photographer said he faced “a lot of hostility” at art school for making work relating to his sexuality.“I couldn’t make gay work, and I couldn’t make gay work about India, especially,” he said. “There was none in the library for reference. So, I thought, ‘I’m making it my mission to make some. Not for India, but for this canon — we need to have gay Indian guys in our library, in our art schools, over here.’”New York’s Museum of Modern Art has since acquired several of the pictures for its permanent collection, signifying the series’ place in contemporary photography. But it was not an instant success.“It didn’t have any impact when it was first shown,” Gupta said of its debut. “I think it was too early.”By the 1990s, however, interest in Gupta’s work was growing, as art made by, and about, gay people of color became increasingly visible in the West. The fact that “Exiles” is now showing in India, where he said it is positively received, is testament to changes on the subcontinent, too.Although the country’s LGBTQ communities still face significant social stigma, gay sex was decriminalized in 2018 and the arrival of apps like Grindr have been transformative, Gupta said. (“Those sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening — or maybe happening less,” he added). This modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light.“I think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before Grindr and the internet,” Gupta said. “People think it was all doom and gloom, and people jumping off buildings. They don’t seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then.”This is a message reflected in the photographer’s carefree India Gate shoot, which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight.“It just seemed very pleasurable. It was a nice day out, and I got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh.”“Exiles” is showing via Vadehra Art Gallery at India Art Fair, which runs February 9-12 in New Delhi, India. A book of outtakes from the series, published by Aperture, is available now."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "The FBI has returned a trove of looted Japanese art to its country of origin after a family found a stash of artifacts in their late father’s Massachusetts attic.The family of a deceased World War II veteran contacted the FBI after discovering the items, which they determined to be “very valuable Asian art,” while sorting through his personal effects. The man had never served in the Pacific theater, according to the FBI.“There were some scrolls, there were some pottery pieces, there was an ancient map. They looked old and valuable,” Special Agent Geoffrey J. Kelly, art crime coordinator for FBI Boston and a member of the FBI Art Crime Team, said in a statement.“And because of this, they did a little research and they determined that at least the scrolls had been entered about 20 years ago in the FBI’s National Stolen Art File.”Among the items were six 18th-19th-century painted scrolls, an ornate 19th-century hand-drawn map of Japan’s fifth largest island, Okinawa, and pottery and ceramics that included plates, bowls and teapots.When unfurled and studied at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Asian Art in Washington, D.C., the scrolls showed colorful portraits of Okinawan royalty.A typewritten letter found alongside the artifacts in Massachusetts helped confirm they were looted during the last days of World War II, the FBI added.“When taken together, they really represent a substantial piece of Okinawan history,” Kelly said of the artifacts.“A nation’s cultural identity is really summed up in the artifacts and the history,” he said.“This is what makes a culture. And without it, you’re taking away their history. And the surest way to eliminate a culture is to eliminate their past. And so, it’s really important for us as stewards of artifacts and cultural patrimony to make every effort that we can to see that these go back to the civilizations and the cultures in the countries where they belong,” Kelly added.The artifacts were returned to Okinawa last week, the FBI said, but noted that several Okinawan objects are still missing and are listed in the National Stolen Art File."

        "title": "World’s oldest unchanged brand changes logo for the first time in over 140 years",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "For over 140 years, Lyle’s Golden Syrup — a staple item in any British baker’s pantry — has featured a rather curious logo on its tin: a lion’s carcass surrounded by bees. But now, for the first time since the 1880s, the product recognized by Guinness World Records for having the world’s oldest branding and packaging is undergoing a major redesign.The company said its new visual identity was designed to “refresh the brand’s legacy to appeal to a 21st century audience.”Golden syrup, also known as light treacle, is a sweet, amber-colored syrup made from refined sugar that was first produced by Abram Lyle & Sons in 1881. The company’s founder, the Scottish businessman Abram Lyle, chose a logo inspired by the story of Samson who, in the Old Testament, kills a lion with his bare hands only to later discover that honeybees have nestled in the animal’s carcass.In the biblical tale, part of the Book of Judges, Samson eats honey from inside the lion, gives some to his parents and then presents 30 wedding guests with a riddle alluding to the encounter: “Out of the eater came something to eat; out of the strong came something sweet.”An alternative wording of the riddle, “Out of the strong came forth sweetness,” has featured on Lyle’s logo since its inception.The new logo, meanwhile, gives the animal a more abstracted — and somewhat more animated — appearance. Just a single bee remains, located slightly above the lion’s head.Acknowledging the product’s unchanged branding in 2006, Guinness World Records noted that the only alterations made since 1885 were “slight technical changes during the war due to shortages of materials.” In 2008, to mark the product’s 125th anniversary, then-owner Tate & Lyle announced that it was changing the tin to a gold color, although the logo remained unchanged.Tate & Lyle was formed in the 1920s when Lyle’s firm merged with rival sugar refinery Henry Tate & Sons. The company, now a major global food and beverage supplier, sold its sugar refining business (including Lyle’s Golden Syrup) to US firm American Sugar Refining, or ASR Group, in 2010.The product’s old logo will continue to be used on Lyle’s classic golden syrup tin, though its bottles and dessert toppings will all now bear the new branding. A company spokesperson declined to comment on whether this represents a majority of the units sold.In a statement, brand director for Lyle’s Golden Syrup, James Whiteley, said that “consumers need to see brands moving with the times and meeting their current need.”“Our fresh, contemporary design brings Lyle’s into the modern day, appealing to the everyday British household while still feeling nostalgic and authentically Lyle’s,” he added. Still, the redesign was met with mixed reactions. On Instagram, designer Laura Evans described the new logo as “contemporary and clever.” She added: “It cuts the fuss and gets straight to the point, whilst retaining the core essence and magic. It says more about the product’s texture and feel than the etched lion surrounded by bees did.”Others however, including several Christian commentators, were less complimentary. “This is what happens when brand managers get involved: take a story that has survived 2000 years and ‘refresh’ it (i.e. ditch it),” author Colin Freeman wrote on X."

        "title": "Witty, sexy, low cost and low brow: The enduring appeal of Pop art",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "As accidental adverts for art shows go, a giant pooch made of flowers is a crowd pleaser. Outside the Guggenheim Bilbao in northern Spain, Jeff Koons’ much-loved flower 1992 sculpture “Puppy,” shows how Pop art — that high kick of counter-intuitive artistic expression so often equated with the 1960s — never really went away.It’s appropriate then, that Koons’ monumental 43ft-high Highland Terrier made of 38,000 bedding plants sits faithfully — and spectacularly — outside the museum’s new show “Signs and Objects: Pop Art from the Guggenheim Collection.”The exhibition both celebrates and deconstructs Pop – the artistic movement that reframed everything from comics to product packaging as high art in a mashup of Dada, Surrealism and, some would say, chicanery. The show delivers bombastic examples by many of the old masters — Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg — while pondering whether Pop has a place in today’s cultural landscape.Curators present Warhol’s silkscreened electric chairs — “When you see a gruesome picture over and over again, it doesn’t really have any effect,” he once remarked — and Lichtenstein’s cartoonish studies using Ben Day dots. But there are also whimsical works from the 1990s and 2000s by Claes Oldenburg and Maurizio Cattelan (who presents a bitterly comic sculpture of Pinocchio drowned in a pond), and more recent politically minded pieces by contemporary artists such as Lucia Hierro, whose work addresses cultural identity as much as the effects of capitalism and consumerism. The Pop baton has been handed over numerous times in art history.The Guggenheim Museum was pivotal to the development of the movement, both in terms of its fame and its art historical importance. In 1963 it staged the New York exhibition “Six Painters and the Object” in which works by Warhol, Lichtenstein and Rauschenberg joined those of Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist and Jim Dine in their museum debut, solidifying the artists’ scholarly importance. And the museum has been collecting in the field ever since.The Bilbao show includes 40 works, dating from 1961 to 2021. The largest,“Soft Shuttlecock” (1995) by Claes Oldenburg and his wife Coosje van Bruggen, was specifically created for the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed rotunda of the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan. In Bilbao, the monstrous shuttlecock with its flaccid feathers sits in its own space like a sad echo of an ancient badminton game between giants. Pop can be funny and melancholy at the same time.The show is primarily spread over two main galleries, the first showing large-format high-sheen works by, primarily American A-listers — including a huge green self portrait of Warhol looking like the Wicked Witch of the West — while the second shifts the focus to European artists, such as Mimmo Rotella and Sigmar Polke). Audiences move from the “new, shiny” realm of a young country to the regions with “long histories”, notes Lauren Hinkson, who has co-curated the Bilbao exhibition with fellow Guggenheim scholar Joan Young.Pop has become synonymous with the stuff of shop shelves and self-promotion. So, is it partly responsible for today’s rabid consumerism and narcissism? “Sure,” says Hinkson. “Andy Warhol chief among them. He did it before anyone had thought to do it, before the Kardashians even thought to take a selfie. Warhol anticipated all of that.” Those original Pop pioneers, she notes, “turned a mirror back on the culture, they made the public self-aware.” And today, she adds, contemporary artists are injecting wit into the mix. “But it’s an incredibly dark read.” Poor old Pinocchio is a case in point.In the exhibition entrance, “A Little Bit of Everything (2017-21)” by the Dominican American contemporary artist Lucía Hierro, highlights the potential of Pop to be both critical and culturally specific. Hierro has created a giant shopping bag full of Latin-American groceries that briefly baffles audience’s sense of scale. The work, created in collaboration with her late mother Lucía Guzmán García, features a selection of oversized felt replicas of Dominican products, all jumbled together. It’s a strange melding of the personal, political and whimsical.Talking from her studio in New York, Hierro explains how she brings an outsider’s perspective on the movement, blending politics – in particular discussions of colonialism – and family lore into an aesthetic often thought of as universal and generic. “I see myself in an interesting position as a Dominican American and Spanish-speaking Caribbean to confront and analyze my place within these systems, within the visual analysis we call ‘Pop’.”Like many of the works on view in ‘Signs and Objects’, Hierro’s work is as playful as it is profound. “I’ve always loved humor in art,” says Hierro. “Humor is a great way to engage with each other, especially when wanting to broach heavier subjects. It’s not passive like entertainment; it’s collaborative.” Outside the museum, Koons’ giant hound of marigolds and begonias punctuates her point perfectly. As people pass, they giggle and get their Instagram snaps. Pop was never going to get just 15 minutes of fame."

        "title": "Photo of a man posing with a Coca-Cola bottle in 1981 symbolized a cultural shift in China",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A young man stands grinning in Beijing’s Forbidden City. It’s the dead of winter, and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill. The other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass Coca-Cola bottle.Today, Coke is the world’s most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere. But back in 1981, when the image was shot by Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer Liu Heung Shing, it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary Chinese people.Liu, who was in his late 20s when he began working for Time magazine in Beijing, felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.“The changes (at first) were subtle, and unless you lived there, you wouldn’t have noticed,” he recalled during an interview at his home in Hong Kong.He had earlier photographed people grieving for Mao along the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou. It was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late-1950s China, where he grew up during the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign — a series of failed industrialization policies — before moving back to Hong Kong as a child.Under Mao, the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty, and the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. But in the aftermath of the Chinese leader’s death, Liu said, “suddenly, people’s steps looked a little bit lighter, they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed.”It would prove to be a relatively liberal period in Chinese history — politically, economically and in terms of everyday life, which Liu captured in candid shots. One photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure. Another depicted people gathering at a “Democracy Wall” in Beijing, where they wrote now-unthinkable criticisms of the government.One of Liu’s most iconic images was captured on his way into the Time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was “missing.” He turned his car around and, sure enough, a large portrait of Mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down. He quickly shot images of workers gathered around the depiction of the late Chairman, with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame.This was China “moving out of the shadow of Mao,” he said.In December 1978, Coca-Cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland Chinese market since the communist revolution. That same month, Beijing and Washington announced the normalization of Sino-American relations and Deng Xiaoping kick-started China’s transformative economic reforms with his “Open Door” policy. (Coca-Cola was first introduced to China in the 1920s but had been forced to leave in 1949, along with other foreign companies, by a government that regarded it as bourgeois).Liu had photographed the opening of a joint-venture bottling plant in Beijing, capturing Coke chairman Roberto Goizueta and Chinese trade officials drinking Coca Cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of “ganbei” (cheers). He then thought to himself, “Now where do I find a (regular) Chinese person enjoying this (drink)?”He headed to the Forbidden City, with its heavy flow of tourists, and soon found a man named Zhang Wei purchasing a Coke from a small stand.“I remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy Coke: ‘It tastes so-so’” said Liu, who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace’s picturesque pavilions in the background.The response to Coke itself may have been underwhelming, but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many Chinese people felt at the time.“As a photographer, I of course realized the significance. That this man, dressed in a ubiquitous PLA (People’s Liberation Army) coat, was one of the very first people to taste it,” he said, adding: “But I didn’t realize it would become part of the Chinese collective memory.”The image would be widely published and displayed in the following years, and he later became friends with Zhang. In 1983, it appeared in Liu’s photography book “China after Mao,” a collection of images taken between 1976 and 1982. More recently he included it in his book “Liu Heung Shing: A Life in a Sea of Red.”The photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country’s modern history, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. And just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy, Liu’s Coca-Cola photograph feels part of another era altogether.With its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign — ideas encapsulated in that most American of drinks — the image stands in stark contrast to today’s China, where relations with the US are at an all-time low. Xi Jinping’s nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the West.“I realized that the story I did in the last quarter of the 20th century (would) continue to carry relevance into the 21st century,” Liu said.“Especially with the story of China, I never doubt that these photographs are in the Chinese people’s collective memory.“Even though this memory keeps being re-edited… the good thing about a photograph, is you cannot re-edit it. It becomes an image seared in people’s minds.”Top image: A 1981 photograph of a man with a Coke bottle in Beijing’s Forbidden City, shot by Liu Heung Shing."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "The former London home of rock legend Freddie Mercury is available to buy – that is, for those with a cool £30 million ($38 million) to spare.Garden Lodge in Kensington, west London, was home to the Queen front man for 11 years, and boasts features including a Japanese sitting room, a double height drawing room, a bar/library and a music center.The property was bought by Mercury on the spot when he first visited it in 1980, according to Knight Frank, which is handling the sale.Collaborating with specialist interior architect and designer Robin Moore Ede, Mercury renovated the home over the next decade, using the finest materials and his personal design taste to create what he called his “country house in central London,” Knight Frank said in a press release Monday.The Queen singer designed his home to be a “memorable, inviting place that reflected his vibrant personality and eclectic vision,” the release added.In this spirit, the dining room was painted citrus-yellow, reportedly Mercury’s favorite color, with complementary jewel tones in the cornices of the room.Once home to the grand piano that Mercury used to compose “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the drawing room offers views of the property’s garden, which is adorned with large magnolia trees and “oriental inspired” water features.The property’s principal suite is entered through what used to be Mercury’s dressing room, where he stored his clothes and stage costumes. The room is mirrored from floor to ceiling, with multiple cupboard doors.Upon his death in 1991, Mercury bequeathed the property and all of its possessions to his close friend and confidante, Mary Austin.After more than 30 years taking care of them, Austin, now 72, auctioned about 1,400 of Mercury’s belongings last year, and is now looking to sell Garden Lodge for offers in excess of £30 million ($38 million), according to Knight Frank.“This house has been the most glorious memory box, because it has such love and warmth in every room,” Austin said in the press release.“It has been a joy to live in and I have many wonderful memories here. Now that it is empty, I’m transported back to the first time we viewed it.“Ever since Freddie and I stepped through the fabled green door, it has been a place of peace, a true artist’s house, and now is the time to entrust that sense of peace to the next person,” she added."

        "title": "The rarest US stamp is going up for auction. It’s expected to sell for millions",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Here’s something for serious stamp collectors only. This summer, philatelists will have a chance to snag the rarest US stamp ever: the 1868 one-cent “Z-grill.”Interested? It’ll cost you (more than) a pretty penny.On June 14, the one-cent Z-grill will be put up for sale by Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries, marking the first time the rare stamp has been on auction since 1998. Experts from the New York auction house say it could fetch four to five million dollars, which would make it the single most expensive US stamp ever sold. (It’s surpassed internationally by the British Guiana One-Cent Magenta, which sold in 2021 for $8.3 million.)The reason for the exorbitant cost is simple. Of the two known copies of the one-cent Z-grill, one is held by the New York Public Library. That leaves only one one-cent Z-grill available to private collectors. Since 2005, the coveted stamp has belonged to billionaire investor and “bond king” Bill Gross.“It’s considered the trophy of collecting United States stamps,” said Charles Shreve, who has managed and built Gross’ extensive stamp collection for years and serves as director of international auctions at Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries.“There’s only one. If you want to brag, that’s the stamp.”To the untrained eye, the blue one-cent Z-grill, which depicts the nation’s first postmaster general Benjamin Franklin, looks like any old stamp. What’s distinct about it is the waffle pattern embossed in the paper, also known as a Z grill.The detail has a fascinating history. After the Civil War, the US Post Office “developed an irrational fear” of people cleaning and reusing stamps, which in turn would contribute to a loss of revenue, Scott Trepel, president of Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries, told CNN.One of the ways they sought to prevent stamp fraud was through a technique called grilling, which created a pattern of small indentations in the surface of the paper. Once the stamp was canceled, the ink would seep through those indentations into the stamp, making it difficult to reuse. The Z grill, while uncommon, was one of several grilling patterns.“Does it look like a lot of other cheap stamps? Yeah, on the face of it, it looks like a common stamp,” Trepel said. “But that grill is what makes it so important.”The one-cent Z-grills were produced in 1868. According to Trepel, this particular one was discovered in 1916 and reemerged in 1957. The stamp came on the market in 1975, selling for $42,500, and again in 1977, this time selling for $90,000, according to the auction house. Eventually, it was acquired by Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss, who sold it in 1986 for $418,000.The one-cent Z-grill came up for auction once again in 1998.Gross, co-founder of the Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) and a lifelong philatelist, had enlisted Charles Shreve to help him assemble a complete collection of every single stamp issued by the US Postal Service.He got his hobby from his mother, who started collecting stamps when Gross was a child. According to Shreve, she believed they would increase in value and yield enough money to pay for his college education.When the collection proved worthless, Gross couldn’t forget the dejected look on his mother’s face. So he set out to prove her theory.“When he started to make money, he said to himself, ‘I’m gonna prove that my mother was right buying stamps. She just bought the wrong ones,’” Shreve said.The one-cent Z grill was one of the last stamps Gross needed to realize his goal, but he ultimately lost the 1998 auction to fellow stamp collector Don Sundman, Shreve said.In 2005, Gross finally acquired the one-cent Z-grill by purchasing a block of Inverted Jennies for $3 million and trading it to Sundman for the prized stamp, finally completing his collection.Once Gross had completed that goal, he ventured into collecting other rare stamps before eventually losing interest. He started selling some of them in 2007, but hung onto his beloved collection of US stamps until about 2017, when he told Shreve he was ready to sell that too.The entire collection is estimated to be worth $15 to $20 million. The top 100 stamps from the collection will be auctioned off on June 14, while the remaining stamps will be sold on June 15.“There’s multiple stamps that’ll bring $500,000 or $750,000, but the (one-cent) Z-grill is the star of the show,” Shreve said. “I just know some people who are lusting for it, and we want to try to get as many people interested in it as possible.”"

        "category": "style",
        "text": "The cast of “Barbie” will go down in red-carpet history for their dedication to method dressing, as stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling diligently showed up to press events, premieres and award shows in outfits that could have been borrowed straight from Barbie and Ken’s dollhouse closets.But at the Academy Awards on Sunday, where the summer blockbuster was nominated for nine awards, including “Best Picture,” Robbie appeared to pass the pink torch to co-star America Ferrera, wearing a striking black (but decidedly non-Barbie-like) gown while Ferrera arrived in shimmering hot pink.Still, it seemed as if the actors’ dresses were connected, and linked to that of “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig’s too. While Robbie and Ferrera’s dresses were polar opposite in color and mood, they were both courtesy of Versace and seemed to be made of the same chainmail material. (Robbie’s was fresh off the Fall-Winter 2024 runway, while Ferrera’s was custom-made.) Gerwig’s gown, meanwhile, was a sparkling Gucci number of crystal mesh that also had an armor-like feel.The collection of feminine chainmail was a subtle play on power dressing — appropriate for the movie’s message of female empowerment. But they weren’t the only “Barbie” cast and team members to sparkle. With a touch of Ken’s flair for opulence, Gosling wore a custom Gucci black tuxedo suit lined with sparkling beading, while Simu Liu opted for a black jacket cinched with a glittering brooch clasp.Despite missing out to Oppenheimer’s Robert Downey Jr. for the best actor in a supporting role award, Gosling later channeled all his Kenergy during a delightful performance of the song “I’m Just Ken.” He was joined by a crew of Kens including Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Ncuti Gatwa and Scott Evans, and a surprise appearance by guitarist Slash, and wore a hot pink studded suit with matching leather gloves — and shades of course.Though Ferrera didn’t win Best Supporting Actress (the award went to Da’Vine Joy Randolph for “The Holdovers”), her outfit embodied the spirit of the four-minute feminist monologue that helped earn her the nomination, in which her character laments about the ways in which women have to weather impossible and contradictory societal standards.“When I first read it, it just hit me as the truth,” she told the Los Angeles Times last July. “There’s no woman in my life who those words aren’t true for. Not a single one. So it felt like a gift.”"

        "title": "4,000-year-old vial contains ancient red lipstick, archaeologists say",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A small stone vial discovered in southeastern Iran contained a red cosmetic that was likely used as a lip coloring nearly 4,000 years ago, according to archaeologists.The rare find is “probably the earliest” example of lipstick to be scientifically documented and analyzed, the researchers reported in February in the journal Scientific Reports.More than 80% of the analyzed sample was made up of minerals that produce a deep red color — primarily hematite. The mixture also contained manganite and braunite, which have dark hues, as well as traces of other minerals and waxy substances made from vegetables and other organic substances.“Both the intensity of the red coloring minerals and the waxy substances are, surprisingly enough, fully compatible with recipes for contemporary lipsticks,” the study authors noted.It’s not possible to exclude the possibility the cosmetic was used in other ways, say, as a blusher, according to lead study author Massimo Vidale, an archaeologist at the University of Padua’s Department of Cultural Heritage in Italy. But he said the homogenous, deep red color, the compounds used and the shape of the vial “suggested to us it was used on lips.”It’s one of the first examples of an ancient, red-colored cosmetic to be studied, he said, although it wasn’t clear why cosmetic preparations resembling lipstick were uncommon in the archaeological record.“We have no idea, for the moment. The deep red color we found is the first one we met, while several lighter-colored foundations and eye shadows had been identified before,” he said via email.The use of hematite — crushed red ocher — had been documented on stone cosmetic palettes from the late Neolithic, as well as in ancient Egyptian cosmetic vessels, according to Joann Fletcher, a professor in the University of York’s department of archaeology. Whether the vial from Iran was the earliest lipstick, “all comes down to what this new discovery was actually used for,” she said.“It is possible the contents of the vial were used as a lip colour. But they could also have been applied to give colour to the cheeks, or for some other purpose, even if the vial looks like a modern lipstick tube,” said Fletcher, who was not involved in the research, in an email.It is “very plausible” the artifact was a lipstick, said Laurence Totelin, a professor of ancient history in the School of History, Archaeology and Religion at Cardiff University specializing in Greek and Roman science, technology, and medicine.“As the authors point out, the recipe is not dissimilar to a modern one. The deep red colour is also what we would expect for lip make up,” said Totelin, who was not involved in the study, via email.“That said, the ingredients are also regularly found in the preparation of ancient medicines, and the vial has a shape that is not inconsistent with a pharmaceutical use,” Totelin said.Other products previously unearthed in Egypt and the Middle East and studied by archaeologists have included black kohl eyeliners and lighter-colored compounds used as eye shadows or foundations. Unlike other ancient cosmetics, the vial’s concoction had a low lead content. This low level, the researchers suggested, might mean the lipstick’s makers understood the dangers of consuming lead, a naturally occurring toxic metal that can cause numerous health problems.“There is a long and harsh debate among experts on the toxicity of lead compounds in cosmetics,” Vidale said.Earlier research on artifacts from the same region that Vidale was involved with “suggests that 5,000 years ago white lead was the base material for facial foundations, meanwhile the content of our deep red preparation, supposedly meant for lips, was almost lead-free. It might have been a conscious choice,” he said.The preparation contained quartz particles, from ground sand or crystal, perhaps added, the study suggested, as a ”shimmery-glittering agent” — although it was possible they came from the inside of the vial itself, which was finely crafted from a greenish stone called chlorite.It’s also not clear what the original consistency of the cosmetic would have been — a fluid or more solid, Vidale said.“The vial’s slender shape and limited thickness suggest that it could have been conveniently held in one hand together with the handle of a copper/bronze mirror, leaving the other hand free to use a brush or another kind of applicator,” the study authors wrote, citing an ancient Egyptian papyrus dated to the 12th century BC that depicts a young woman painting her lips in such a way as an example.The artifact was among thousands of items unearthed from Bronze Age tombs and graves in the Jiroft region of Iran. The graves — part of an ancient kingdom known as Marhasi — were exposed and dislodged in 2001 when a river flooded, after which their precious contents were looted and sold by locals. Many stone and copper items, including the vial, were subsequently recovered by Iranian security forces.The vial is kept in the National Archaeological Museum of Jiroft, where the team took samples.“Like a bolt out of the blue, this civilization was discovered … when a disastrous flood hit its ancient cemeteries, exposing all kinds of archaeological treasures,” Vidale said.“Now the region is well protected, but serious damages were done,” he added. “What we know today is that this was an advanced Mesopotamian-like civilization, a major player in long-distance trade and military ventures, which used its own writing system and was ruled by large cities and powerful, authoritative rulers. The rest is slowly emerging from new excavations.”It’s not clear who would have worn the lipstick — or in what context. “As far as we know, cosmetics were regularly deposited near the face of the deceased in the graves of the time,” Vidale said.However, given the looting and destruction of the graves, researchers have not been able to link the artifact with specific human remains."

        "title": "‘They’re quite like us’: Scientists reveal groundbreaking finding on Stone Age piercings — and who wore them",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Archaeologists in Turkey have discovered groundbreaking evidence connecting prehistoric facial piercings to the bodies of the people who wore them.Personal adornment — including earring-like objects thought to be worn as piercings — has been documented among Neolithic or late Stone Age peoples in multiple locations across southwest Asia, with evidence from as far back as 12,000 years ago. But none of the objects interpreted as piercings had previously been directly associated with body parts where they may have been worn.Now, analysis of excavations at the archeological site Boncuklu Tarla in southeastern Turkey has revealed burials in which adornments for piercings were found placed near grave occupants’ ears and mouths. Dental wear on the lower incisors of these remains, dating to around 11,000 years ago, resembled known wear patterns caused by abrasion from a type of ornament called a labret, often worn below the lower lip.This is the first time that facial piercings in Neolithic people from southwestern Asia have been directly linked to the body parts that they perforated, researchers reported Monday in the journal Antiquity. Their findings further confirm that the practice was already common during the early Neolithic.People of all ages were buried at Boncuklu Tarla, but the newly described ornaments were found only near the remains of adults. This suggests that such adornments were not worn by children, and acquiring these piercings may have marked coming-of-age rituals within social groups, according to the study.There are some other types of evidence for coming-of-age rituals in the Neolithic, such as burials that arrange the body with certain artifacts “or the placement of the deceased in particular locations prescribed for a particular age group,” said anthropological archaeologist Dusan Boric, an associate professor at Sapienza Università di Roma in Italy, in an email.“But I cannot think of many other examples as convincing as this one,” said Boric, who was not involved in the study.Hunter-gatherers occupied Boncuklu Tarla from around 10,300 BC to 7100 BC, as people began to shift away from a nomadic lifestyle and form settlements. The site was first excavated in 2012 and has since yielded a bounty of ornamental objects from the Neolithic period, with approximately 100,000 decorative artifacts found to date — a staggering number, said study coauthor Dr. Emma L. Baysal, an associate professor of archaeology at Ankara University in Turkey.“The sheer quantity is unbelievable. This is a site of people who just adore adornment, more than at any other site,” Baysal told CNN. “They had masses and masses of beads and they made complicated things out of beads,” including necklaces, bracelets, animal-shaped pendants and decorations that could be sewn onto clothing, Baysal said.They also crafted ornaments for ear and lip piercings. Labrets, which are still worn in some cultures in Amazonia and Africa, come in a variety of forms: rounded, oblong and disc-shaped. Some are long and thin, but most have one end that is wider and flattened, and they vary in diameter and width.Scientists identified 85 objects from Boncuklu Tarla burials as ornaments worn in piercings, made of materials such as flint, limestone, copper and obsidian. The researchers classified the labrets into seven types, based on shape — all measured at least 0.3 inches (7 millimeters) in diameter, and the longest was just over 2 inches (50 millimeters) in length.Ornaments described as Type 1 had long shafts and a “nail-like appearance” and were probably worn “inserted into the flesh or cartilage of the ear,” according to the study. Elongated Types 2, 4 and 6 were also thought to be ear ornaments. By comparison, Types 3 and 5 labrets had shorter, more bulbous shafts — better-suited for lip wear. Type 7, a flattened disc, was also thought to be a kind of labret.Some of the labrets had been dislodged from their original positions in the graves, possibly by rodents, though they were still near the head and neck area of the human remains. Other pieces were still “lodged in position on the upper or lower surface of the skull or under the lower jaw,” the study authors reported.Scientists have long thought that Neolithic objects called labrets were used as piercings, “especially in relation to the mouth or ear,” Dusan said.“However, now we have inconvertible and robust contextual evidence from the site of Boncuklu Tarla that here and very likely at other broadly contemporaneous sites such objects were indeed associated with these parts of the body as they were found in burials and were likely worn in the same way in life.”Though children were buried with pendants and beads, none had ear ornaments or labrets near their heads, necks or chests, indicating that facial piercings were reserved for adults, the researchers concluded.“It’s probably something associated with being grown-up,” Baysal said. “Maybe a kind of social status associated with age, or a particular role in society.”For archaeologists who are working to piece together how prehistoric peoples presented themselves to each other and to outside groups, piercings and other types of body decoration “are the absolute best source of information that we have about people of these periods, until writing is invented and people are directly expressing themselves,” Baysal said.This form of personal expression may be rooted in the mythologies of traditional societies, Dusan added, in which “a specific genre of myths relates to the origin of ornaments and body decoration, suggesting a fundamental importance of decorating the body as an act that goes beyond purely aesthetic concerns,” he said. “Wearing bodily adornment might rather have been an act of personhood construction and protection.”More than tools or other artifacts of daily life, these adornments also share a highly relatable view of Neolithic people, as the human motivation to express identity or community through piercings and other personal ornamentation continues to this day.“When you put earrings on, you can’t see the earrings that you’re wearing. You’re not doing it for yourself, because you can’t see them. You’re doing it for how you project yourself to other people. And I don’t think that has changed for all these thousands of years,” Baysal said. “It’s a way that we can identify with people in the past and think, ‘Well, actually, they’re quite like us.’”Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Photographer Felipe Romero Beltrán’s depiction of a migrant facility in Spain oozes with the boredom and malaise of life in legal limbo. His young subjects are seen smoking cigarettes, lifting weights and trimming one another’s hair. Other images show them hanging out in a grubby yard or lying around on mattresses.The photos were shot with the help of nine young Moroccans whom Beltrán befriended in Seville, capital of the southern region of Andalucía. Published in his new book “Dialect,” the pictures were initially intended to be personal, not political. But they ultimately spoke to what Beltrán called a “Kafka-esque” system in which the men waited for years to learn whether their residency applications would be approved.“At the beginning, it was just about this group of guys,” Beltrán said on a video call from Madrid. “But of course, I realized that I was photographing these really specific political bodies, or political subjects in this bureaucracy.”Last year, nearly 30,000 migrants arrived in Spain by sea, down from a record of over 58,000 in 2018, according to UNHCR data. Of these, most arrived in the Canary Islands or Andalucía, a region separated from Morocco by the Strait of Gibraltar, a stretch of water just 13 kilometers (eight miles) at its narrowest.The nine men, who didn’t previously know one another, were among those to arrive by boat during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in search of a better life. Recounting his journey with an essay in “Dialect,” one of Beltrán’s subjects, Youssef Elhafidi, recalls another terrified teen migrant being forced by smugglers to pilot their boat.“He did not want to drive, the fear was paralyzing him, they took out a knife and put it on his neck, threatening him to start the engines,” Elhafidi wrote. “The boy started the machine between trembling and crying and we headed north.”According to Beltrán, his nine subjects were required to stay in Spain for three continuous years before applying for residency. Undocumented and without the right to work during this time, they were dependent on the state for food and housing.While living at the government-run facility, the men took Spanish lessons and joined workshops to help them adapt to life in Spain — some of which were run by Beltrán.Overcoming an initial language barrier, the photographer began working with the group to produce images and videos. As well as candid portraits, the pictures focus on conditions at the facility, from peeling walls to basic food supplies.Many of the images were, however, staged. As Beltrán looked for different ways to engage with his subjects, he asked them to re-enact moments from their respective migration journeys. In one, a subject lies motionless on blue gym mats, just as he had upon landing on Spain’s coast. Another shows two of the men carrying a third on their shoulders to recreate the moment he fainted during a day-long walk to Seville from a small town to its south.The resulting book is thus part documentary and part performance, with Beltrán toeing the line between mentor and collaborator, photographer and choreographer. More than just an artistic decision, staging photos directly responded to the tedium of the migrants’ abundant free time.“There was an activity around taking the images — it was something during the day that (could get them) excited. And it was fun,” Beltrán recalled. “Everyone was laughing, and they just make jokes each other during the sessions.”When Beltrán began delivering workshops at the facility in 2020, he was all too familiar with the system his subjects were trapped in. A few years earlier, he had relocated to Spain from his native Colombia, and — even as a college-educated Spanish speaker — also struggled to navigate the complex immigration processes.To illustrate the challenge facing his francophone subjects, his project included a video titled “Recital” in which they attempted to read the first four pages of the Spanish immigration law that would determine their futures. “They weren’t understanding a word,” he recalled, noting that, although lawyers were assigned to act on the men’s behalf, the language barrier and dense legalese removed their agency.The opening pages of “Dialect” — whose title alludes to these very linguistical challenges — are dedicated to stills from the video. Pictures of the men struggling to comprehend the legislation are overlaid with technical terminology (“Right to effective judicial protection” reads the text on one frame; another says, “Authorizations for the purpose of carrying out profit-making activities”).“These legal procedures are really, really complicated, even for native speakers,” said Beltrán, who is now completing a PhD program in photography in Madrid. “It becomes almost like translation work — translating these laws and bureaucracies into (something understandable to) normal people like us.”The result, he said, is an inevitable sense of helplessness.“You can’t talk with anyone,” Beltrán added. “You can’t ask, ‘Who is the law?’ or ‘Who is the state?’ You don’t have anyone to approach. You don’t have any tools to make a living… The system is built to avoid you, or to deny you access to (it).”Describing the group as “just young people trying to figure out what to do with life,” the photographer hopes his project can humanize migrants’ experiences in a world increasingly desensitized to images of their suffering.Since Beltrán completed his project, most of his subjects have completed their three-year wait and now formally reside in Spain, he says. He remains in touch with some — including Elhafidi, who he says works in a restaurant and has accompanied him at promotional events for the book’s launch.In the conclusion of his essay, Elhafidi recalled how he felt when he secured his residency, writing: “It took me three years of searching and putting courage to life, until finally the moment came, after being cold, scared, hungry and the most difficult thing, my mother’s tears… I got it,” he wrote.“I got the papers. Now after getting it I have another look at life, I finally feel that I have the opportunity to be whoever I want to be.”“They’re building their lives,” Beltrán said of those, including Elhafidi, who have secured residency. “Fortunately, they now can go back to Morocco to visit and see their families.”“Dialect,” published by Loose Joints, is available now."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Slicked-back hair, a leather jacket, a cross dangling from his ear and his trademark aviator sunglasses.This is how many of George Michael’s fans remember the late, great singer—and his image has now been immortalized just so on a new collectible coin issued by Britain’s Royal Mint.Visitors to the institution’s website had to wait in a virtual line to shop for the limited-edition coins, which went on sale at 9 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) local time on Monday.The design of the coin pays tribute to the late singer’s second solo hit single, “Faith,” according to the Royal Mint. In a statement published online, the mint, which is the official producer of Britain’s coins, said the George Michael coin is the latest addition to its Music Legends series. Similar issues have honored fellow British music stars David Bowie, Elton John and Queen.Officially approved by the estate of the Wham! front man, who died on Christmas Day in 2016 at age 53, the coin was designed by Italian artist and sculptor Sandra Deiana. The headshot is set against an engraving of the refrain of “Faith.”In a statement in the media release, Deiana said she was clear from the start that there were “certain elements” she wanted to include. She added: “I wanted a detailed portrait that captured his charismatic expression—I was particularly thinking of his iconic sunglasses. It’s amazing to be able to pay tribute to his music and what you see in the design is truly a piece of George Michael’s song.”The coin is available in several different finishes and weights, and ranges in price from £15.50 (around $20) to £2,770 ($3,500).In a career spanning four decades, Michael sold more than 100 million albums, with hit singles including “Careless Whisper,” “Faith” and “Jesus to a Child.”The singer, songwriter, producer and philanthropist rose to fame in the early 1980s as one half of Wham!, alongside bandmate Andrew Ridgley. The duo split in 1986 and Michael’s first solo hit was a duet with Aretha Franklin the following year—“I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me).”The issue of the coins comes two months after Wham’s “Last Christmas” reached number one in the UK—39 years after it was first released.Welcoming the coins’ creation, a statement from George Michael Entertainment included in the media release said: “On behalf of George Michael, we are deeply honored that the Royal Mint is paying tribute to him by creating a series of beautifully crafted coins. He would have been enormously proud and genuinely touched that a national institution should have decided to pay tribute to his memory in this way.”"

        "title": "What Paris Jackson and Doja Cat’s latest red carpet looks say about tattoos today",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Tattoos are for life. Unless you buy a heavy duty concealer, as demonstrated by 25-year-old Paris Jackson on Sunday.The model and actor had all 80 of her tattoos expertly covered for the 66th annual Grammy awards, a process that only took her team of two makeup artists two hours in total. In a time lapse video posted to Instagram, Jackson’s skin is painted, brushed and sprayed a convincing ivory color. Out on the red carpet, her body — once a doodle-pad of colored ink and black lines — was a striking blank canvas, emphasized by a slinky, asymmetrical cut-out gown by Celine.While Jackson’s transformation was a savvy collaboration with makeup brand CoverFx, temporary tattoo camouflage has snowballed as an essential celebrity makeup technique.In South Korea, tattoos exist in a legal gray area — meaning K-Pop idols often avoid the social stigma by using bandages or makeup to hide any for broadcast performances. While shooting the Disney+ series “The Bear,” Jeremy Allen White required extensive tattoo coverage (and temporary tattoo re-application) that would withstand filming for hours in a hot kitchen. Similarly, for the 2022 film “My Policeman,” Harry Styles’ distinctive ink was airbrushed to oblivion — an undertaking that took two hours and required Styles to wear a gas mask in the makeup chair. “I’d look at myself with no tattoos and be like, ‘look at this boring *ss body,’” he told Teen Vogue.But the ability to opt out of permanent body art, even just for one night, seems to appeal to some in the limelight. In 2014, Amber Rose made headlines when she attended the Grammys in a decidedly stripped-back look. She wore a gold, art-deco sequinned Naeem Khan gown, her two tattoo sleeves completely erased — their blankness accentuated by a sprinkling of body glitter.On Saturday, Lana del Rey arrived at the pre-Grammy Gala with a couple of barely-there tatts seemingly peaking through a layer of makeup. Rey’s romantic black Vivienne Westwood dress perfectly framed her décolletage, as well as two faded collar bone script tattoos.Elsewhere on the red carpet, while Rey and Jackson were disguising their ink, Doja Cat (who scooped three awards this season) went face-first into the world of — albeit temporary — tattoos. Her sheer, flesh-toned, corset dress was paired with a gallery of removable tattoos, from an imposing chestpiece of a gothic cathedral to Romanesque gargoyles and statues. No one needed to ask who she was wearing, either. The designer of her outfit, Dilara Findikoglu, was emblazoned in Old English font across her forehead.Even the technology of impermanent tattoos has changed. No longer is a soaking wet towel and transfer paper your only option. Now, ink can be smart. Celebrity tattoo studio Bang Bang and research team Hyprskin have this year unveiled “Magic Ink,” a new light-sensitive ink formula that promises to be “rewritable, erasable and reprogrammable.” Using photochromic particles that react to UV light, the molecular structure — and therefore outward appearance — of Magic Ink can be altered by specific light wavelengths. In short, future tattoos may be as customizable and non-committal as a classroom whiteboard.One of the oldest forms of art, dating back at least as far back as 5000 BC, tattoos were once entirely defined by their permanence. Now, they’re almost as interchangeable as a piece of jewelry.Once a sign of commitment, sometimes even a badge of community, the meaning of a tattoo could be shifting. Whether it’s a temporary piece that washes away in a matter of weeks, or an inked image that can be brushed off to match an outfit, the culture of body art has widened out to include those who view their anatomy with the fixity of an etch-a-sketch."

        "title": "What it’s like to be a celebrity photographer at the Oscars",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "It’s been over a century since theater mogul Sid Grauman introduced the concept of the Hollywood red carpet at the 1922 premiere of “Robin Hood.” Ever since, the Tinseltown tradition has seen stars attend film premieres, festivals and award ceremonies bedecked in couture, debuting new looks or new relationships (or, perhaps, subtly hinting at a breakup) with photographers capturing their every move.These behind-the-lens creatives are a crucial link between celebrity and civilian; their work serving as an arbiter of trends and beauty and aspiration in the moment, as well as visual time capsules for years to come. Photographer Chelsea Lauren has documented the red carpet scene for the photo agency Shutterstock for nearly a decade.Every year, from January to April, Lauren shoots most of the major awards ceremonies — the Golden Globes, Emmys, Grammys, alongside other industry events like the Costume Design Guild Awards and Independent Spirit Awards. It’s a hectic time.Billed as the celebrity event of the year, with its 900-foot-long red carpet that sweeps down Hollywood Boulevard and into the Dolby Theatre, the Oscars are on another level.There’s a hierarchy to the arrivals — non-famous attendees take a less central route down the red carpet, while the biggest stars arrive last. But Lauren admits it can be overwhelming, even for some of the seasoned celebrities in attendance. It’s noisy — photographers vie for the attention of stars by calling out their names — and despite a sea of professional lights, camera flashes go off all around as live TV cameras roll.“I have a lot of (actors) tell me they look for me on the carpet because it makes them feel calmer and safe,” Lauren told CNN. “It’s a lot to be screamed at like that… Sometimes, they’ll break from posing and run over to me on the carpet to give me a hug.”Having worked the circuit for several years, Lauren says many celebrities have begun to feel comfortable in her presence — some have even become friends. She cites the likes of Paris Hilton (Lauren took her wedding photos), singer Janelle Monáe and actor and 2024 Oscar nominee Colman Domingo. “He is the most beautiful, wonderful human being in the whole world,” she said of the “Rustin” star. “I’m so proud of him and seeing him flourish this season.”While the stars step out in their finery, the photographers at the Oscars have to put on a show too. It’s one of the only awards shows where there is a dress code, even for those covering the event: Long gowns for women and suits for men.Sartorial mishaps are a major concern for celebrities in the media eye; Lauren recounts a time when one helped her create a bond with actor Daniel Kaluuya at a pre-Oscars party after someone spilt red wine on his suit. “I had a stain remover in my purse that I had just gotten that day… We spent like 20 minutes trying to get this stain out,” she recalled. When they weren’t successful, Lauren helped sneak him out of the party so the other photographers wouldn’t catch it. The next day on the Oscars red carpet, Kaluuya pointed at Lauren and yelled “You’re my G!” “It’s just the little moments like that,” she said. “I treat people like people and not like ATMs. Those result in some fun photos sometimes.”While undoubtedly fun, being a red carpet photographer is not all glamour. Lauren says that people don’t realize how much there is to be done at the same time — from recognizing, by name, the hundreds of celebrities who come past her lens to getting a variety of images of each person.Every year for the Oscars, Lauren’s assignment changes. Sometimes, it’s shooting the show, executive arrivals or the afterparty. This year, she is only shooting arrivals — since she’ll be on a plane the very next morning to shoot studio portraits at South by Southwest. “Once that’s done, maybe I’ll get to sleep,” she laughed.With a warm demeanor and talent behind the lens, Lauren is a natural celebrity photographer, but her career began as a hobby. (Growing up in the LA suburbs, Lauren also worked as a child actor herself, but now says she’s much happier as a “celebrity adjacent.”) “When I was younger, my grandparents got me a nice camera, and I used to take it everywhere,” she told CNN. Eventually, when her portfolio was strong enough, Lauren went for a job at an agency. “I brought in a big book of photos, all old-school, and plopped it down,” says Lauren. She landed the job, working for the agency for about seven years until Shutterstock hired her.A lot has changed since Lauren first began her career. Back then, she was one of “very few” women on the red carpet — only 30 percent of the press pack she estimates, with the rest being “men who were significantly older.”“I don’t like conflict at all,” Lauren said. “And other photographers would try to push me around or try to claim their territory and say, ‘You can’t do this. You go over here.’ Now, I’m like, ‘No, I’m good here.’ I’m gonna stand my ground. I wish I’d been a little more aggressive about that,” she said.Now, however, the gender split is closer to 50/50 which has brought about changes at events. “I have definitely seen a shift. Certain behaviors aren’t so acceptable anymore, which is really wonderful because it became a more welcoming place for women to work,” she said. “Diversity is increasing in general, which is wonderful.”Even though she’s been photographing the stars for over 15 years, Lauren hasn’t lost her perspective. “I’m grateful to be around the most creative, talented, artistic, beautiful human beings in the world,” she said. It’s easy to forget when you’re in the midst of working, but if you take a step back from yourself, it’s like, ‘wow, I have a dream job.’ It’s really special.”"

        "text": "The red carpet at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre shimmered on Sunday, as the stars arrived at the Oscars in a flurry of sequins, sparkles and striking metallic gowns.Lupita Nyong’o’s Armani Privé dress, Gabrielle Union’s bedazzled Carolina Herrera number and Michelle Yeoh’s custom Balenciaga gown were among the glittering looks on display during an elegant — if somewhat unadventurous — evening of red-carpet fashion. (Indeed, a fair number of attendees opted for monochrome black, white or black-and-white ensembles.)Elsewhere, “Barbie” actor America Ferrera gave the metallic trend a pop of color in a pink chainmail design by Atelier Versace, while co-star Margot Robbie took a rare break from Barbie-pink in an equally glistening black Versace dress. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande also opted for color-coded dressing, with the former’s emerald-green leather Louis Vuitton dress and the latter’s pillowy pink custom Giambattista Valli gown nodding to their roles in the forthcoming movie adaptation of “Wicked.”This awards season has provided plenty of florals, cut-outs and sheer gowns, but the Oscars heralded a new theme altogether: mermaid chic.Sunday’s red carpet was awash with gowns channeling scallops and shells, from Anya Taylor-Joy’s Christian Dior Haute Couture gown, inspired by Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus,” to Best Actress nominee Carey Mulligan’s custom Balenciaga look featuring an elegant mermaid skirt. Elsewhere, Emma Stone wowed in a shell-inspired custom Louis Vuitton dress with a flared peplum waist, and Hailee Steinfeld looked ethereal in a sea foam green Elie Saab Couture design.The evening’s menswear was relatively pared back, on what is usually the most formal of Hollywood red carpets (though that didn’t stop Simu Liu and “Young Royals” star Omar Rudberg from turning up shirtless). Even actors known for colorful suiting like Colman Domingo and Ryan Gosling, who arrived in Louis Vuitton and Gucci, respectively, stuck to a largely black palette, though many accessorized with broaches, bracelets and pins. Gosling did, however, make the change into a hot-pink number for his performance of the Best Original Song-nominated “I’m Just Ken” during the ceremony.Ramy Youssef, Mark Ruffalo, Mahershala Ali and Finneas meanwhile used their lapels to call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. They were joined by a handful of other attendees — including Billie Eilish, Ava DuVernay and Quannah Chasinghorse — wearing red pins as part of the Artists4Ceasefire campaign.Scroll down to see the best looks from the 96th Academy Awards."

        "title": "A nostalgic look back at when the Internet still felt joyful",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "At the turn of the millennium, web-based technology was in a state of chrysalis. Google was just one of several mainstream search engines, not yet a monopolistic empire. Dial-up internet (and its iconic dial tone) was still a thing in many American homes. File-sharing services like Napster and LimeWire were just beginning to take off. MP3 players and advances in 3D graphics represented brand-new technology.And in sweaty dorm rooms and sparse basements across the world, people brought their desktop monitors together to set up a local area network (LAN) and play multiplayer games — “Half-Life,” “Counter-Strike,” “Starsiege: Tribes,” “StarCraft,” “WarCraft” or “Unreal Tournament,” to name just a few. These were informal but high-stakes gatherings, then known as LAN parties, whether winning a box of energy drinks or just the joy of emerging victorious.The parties could last several days and nights, with gamers crowded together among heavy computers and fast food boxes, crashing underneath their desks in sleeping bags and taking breaks to pull pranks on each other or watch movies.Since then, much has changed. For one, the gaming world has evolved from a user-driven subculture to a multi-billion dollar industry that is less about getting together in person and more about a wider web of e-sports competitions, the lucrative intersection of gaming and content creation and a prominent corporate fingerprint on gameplay, design and monetization.Particularly for Gen Z gamers, a generation that grew up almost completely in the smartphone era, 25 years ago may feel like a different reality. But for millennials and Gen Xers, the boxy monitors and pixelated graphics will be familiar reminders of a not-so-distant technological past.It’s this nostalgia that prompted writer and podcaster Merritt K to document the era’s gaming culture in her new photobook “LAN Party.” After floating the idea on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, she received an immediate — and visceral — response from old-school gamers all too keen to share memories and photos from LAN parties and gaming conventions across the world.“I know that none of these are my friends and I,” wrote one X user in response to the images in K’s call-out post, “but because the photos feel so familiar I find myself looking for us all. This is pretty much how most weekends in 2000-2004 looked for us.”“Despite the fact that, in a literal sense, I am not in any of these photos, high school me is in every one of these photos,” another wrote.Many people who had never experienced the era of LAN parties also responded with excitement. “I think everyone has some kind of nostalgia for a period before they were alive,” K told CNN. “I had people who are 20 years old, who were tweeting and being like, ‘I was born in the wrong decade.’”Throughout the pages of “LAN Party,” there is an all-too evocative sense of fernweh — fond, wistful memories for a pastime in times past. It’s strange to remember that the internet was once a place you went to spend time with other real people; a tethered space, not a cling-film-like reality enveloping the corporeal world from your own pocket.“That time — the late ’90s, early 2000s — was pre-social media,” K said. “It’s the era of blogs and forums. No one really had 24/7 access. So even though we were starting to get high-speed internet, it was still a place that you went, rather than just another part of your life. And this feeling of connecting to people in other parts of the world was cool. It wasn’t something that was taken for granted yet.”Growing up as a teenager in this era, you could feel a sense of hope (that perhaps now feels like naivete) about the possibilities of technology, K explained. The book is full of photos featuring people smiling and posing with their desktop monitors, pride and fanfare apparent. At that point in time, many new tech products were designed with ostentatious playfulness in mind — cellphones were often blinged out or swiveled up, cameras came in hot pink shells and tech companies even collaborated with luxury fashion houses.“It felt like, ‘Wow, the future is coming,’” K said. “It was this exciting time where you felt like you were just charting your own way. I don’t want to romanticize it too much, because obviously it wasn’t perfect, but it was a very, very different experience.”It was also a new era for photography. Digital cameras — with which most of the photos in “LAN Party” were taken — had just become widely available to the public. As a result, the visuals are grainy, unedited and generally low quality by today’s standards. Documenting everyday life through images was still an anomaly, after all, K said. As such, people in the book’s photos weren’t yet conscious of their best angles, nor does it seem they were necessarily trying to look ‘good’ for the camera.“Some people are just making goofy faces, flipping the camera off,” K said. “No one really knows how to be in a selfie yet. When digital cameras show up, it starts to become a much more everyday thing… people are figuring out, ‘How do I look in this picture? What do I do?’”Of course, many of the photos also portend what was to come. They also contain early footprints of modern gamer culture stereotypes — dank, antisocial and seemingly unhealthy environments. (Despite gaming’s global popularity, today it is sometimes characterized as the domain of young White men, internalizing and disseminating racist, misogynistic or right-wing politics.)Still, “it was a little more communal,” K said. “If you’re playing games in the same room with someone, it’s a different experience than doing it online. You can only be so much of a jackass to somebody who was sitting three feet away from you, whereas today with online games, toxicity is a huge problem. Being anonymous online can inspire the worst in people.”Though they have significantly dwindled in frequency, LAN parties do still take place. (They have also maintained their status over the years as cultural iconography; a photo of a man duct-taped to the ceiling — but still playing “Counter-Strike,” mind you — in a dimly-lit room during such a party for example, has become a legendary gamer meme in its own right). K acknowledges a fascination among young people in memorializing the phenomenon, but the parties are today still mostly hosted and attended “IRL” by people who remember what the experience was like the first time around.“We’ve kind of lost a lot of control, I think over our relationship to technology,” K said. “We have lost a lot of privacy as well. There’s less of a sense of exploration because there just isn’t as much out there.”"

        "title": "How this dream-like photo challenges notions of the male gaze",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A group of men lie at the foot of a sofa, their naked bodies peeking out through a carpet of rose petals. Some look toward the photograph’s protagonist, an Asian woman in a lime green dress laying across the cushioned loveseat. Others gaze away, seemingly indifferent, as if caught in some sort of hazy spell.Despite Chinese photographer Yushi Li’s gentle staging, her title for the photograph, “The Smothering Dream,” suggests something more sinister is at play. Referencing Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema’s 1888 work “The Roses of Heliogabalus,” in which a Roman emperor watches on as unsuspecting banquet guests slowly suffocate in flowers, Li’s modern take — shot on a set awash with pastel colors and delicate furniture — is equally deceptive at first glance.Li, is not only the photographer, but also the muse at the center of the image. “I made this very pink and kitsch dream,” she said, describing the London living room set in a phone interview. “But underneath it, there is, like, some kind of violence. It’s a fantasy of love and eroticism… smothering these men I desire.”Shot in 2022, “The Smothering Dream” was recently on show at Photofairs Shanghai as part of a group exhibition called “A Quiet Gaze.” It was a fitting title to showcase the work of an artist for whom an examination of the male and female gazes has been a recurring theme.Li’s wider portfolio of subversive images include softly-lit nude portraits of strangers she scouted through a dating app (a series titled “My Tinder Boys”). Stripped of their clothes and therefore their character, she said, the men lounge around their homes doing banal tasks: one scoops out of a fresh watermelon, while another casually balances a plate of spaghetti over his private parts.The series is partly a response to erotic images objectifying women that are historically ubiquitous in art, advertisements and photography. Although a canon of male nudes does exist, it largely comprises images shot by gay male photographers. When Li began the series in 2017, she noticed a lack of images depicting naked men as objects of desire from a woman’s perspective.After some mistook her work as being shot by a male photographer, she began inserting herself into the photos — fully clothed alongside naked counterparts, and often the only person looking directly at the camera.“Instead of being a passive, ‘looked-at’ thing, I want to be the one who is in control, who is creating the story, who is expressing my fantasy,” said Li.Her images have also pushed back against the longstanding fetishization of Asian women, often by Western men, something Li said she has experienced first-hand: “I’m a small person, and come across as quiet, so I kind of fit the stereotype.” Li, who was born in China’s Hunan province and now lives in the UK.She said she feels flattered when women reach out to her online to say they feel empowered by her photographs. “As a woman, especially as an Asian or Chinese woman, you (should be able to) feel that you can also express your erotic desire.”Li has been fascinated with how the idea of the gaze has, today, become “less binary.” She has also been examining and playing with the way classical paintings depict power dynamics, portrayals of desire and representations of the body.She brings these ideas into “Paintings, Dreams and Love,” an ongoing project to which “The Smothering Dream” belongs. (A second photo from the same shoot, entitled “After the Dream,” hints at what has just taken place, with satin cushions and wilted petals strewn about the scene).Other sources of inspiration include Swiss painter Henry Fuseli’s 1781 “The Nightmare,” showing an incubus crouching menacingly atop a sleeping woman, and “The Death of Actaeon,” Renaissance painter Titian’s 16th-century oil painting of the Romans’ goddess of the hunt, Diana, transforming the Theban hero into a stag that is then killed by his own hounds.In Li’s reinterpretations, she is in full control. In the former, she wears a tight, red turtleneck as she casually sits on an unsuspecting male figure, thwarting the idea of seduction. In the latter, she strikes a calm, calculated pose, pointing a bow and arrow at a naked man in a window.But control, Li says, is subjective in images where multiple gazes can co-exist. “Some of these men (in the photographs) also look at me, and the viewer also looks at all of us,” she said. The internet age, she added, has only further complicated matters. “Now you can look at so many things like instantly, everywhere, or wherever, whenever you want… it’s something very different, it’s not (just) a physical thing, it’s a digital thing.“There’s also the gaze from the algorithm, and the gaze from the screen that reflects yourself when you look at it… the internet (means) we’re subjected to the gaze more, in a way.”"

        "title": "What this playful photo reveals about Hong Kong’s infamous ‘Walled City’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "It was the summer of 1989. Hong Kong’s humidity – already oppressive – was intensified in the dark, maze-like alleyways of an unruly enclave known as Kowloon Walled City. Then the most densely populated place on Earth, its buildings were packed together so tightly that barely a slither of sky was visible from the ground.Searching for a moment of respite from the heat and chaos below, photographer Greg Girard found himself on the roof of one of the enclave’s many illegally-built high-rises among a tangled thicket of television antennas.He wasn’t alone. In the Walled City, the delineation of private and public spaces “wasn’t always so clear,” Girard recalled in a video call, adding that the roof was an escape for many of its residents to relax, do laundry or watch planes land at Kai Tak International Airport. “Once you get up to the rooftop, everything sort of changes. The vista opens up, and it’s cooler, there’s a breeze.”Navigating the narrow gaps between buildings with planks of wood, children would skip and play between the webs of laundry lines and satellites. “No one seemed to think of it as a dangerous place, even though there were no guardrails or anything like that,” said Girard.On that particular summer day, some children spotted Girard’s camera and approached him. When he turned the lens on them, they began performing and pulling faces. He snapped several shots, describing the final one, which he eventually chose to publish, as the moment when they had “settled into this face-off with me.”In the photograph a young girl, barefoot and wearing a blue dress, stares into the camera. Her face is relaxed and her hands are wrapped around an antenna pole as if she’s about to swing. In the backdrop, her friend strikes a defiant stance, hands on her hips, while another is in the throes of messing around, bent double in a playful squat.“I thought (the image) captured the kids’ indifference to the potential danger … of the rooftop, while at the same time sort of owning their territory and confronting me while goofing around,” said Girard, adding: “It was just quite an average day up on (there).”The playfulness of the children, juxtaposed with the jagged antennas and stark concrete of their surroundings, seem to epitomized the spirit of Kowloon Walled City, the photographer said.“It wasn’t an ideal playground but that never seemed to bother anyone — which was, of course, very much the spirit of the Walled City: making the best of, and even enjoying life in, a situation most other people would be horrified by.”Girard first visited Kowloon Walled City in 1986 while on a shoot at the nearby airport.At that time, around 350 buildings, up to 14 stories high, were packed precariously into a space of 0.01 square miles. Most of the towers were built without proper foundations or regard for safety codes.“This strange, vertical village wasn’t really supposed to exist,” said Girard, explaining the Kowloon Walled City was the product of a historical and political quirk. Although the enclave was situated in the middle of Hong Kong, then a British colony, imperial officials refused to take legal responsibility for it. As such, the Walled City remained technically subject to Chinese rule, though this was never enforced.“That allowed it to become something you couldn’t have dreamed up,” Girard added.Existing in ambiguity for nearly a century, it had a reputation for illicit dealings and was infamous for its triads, drug dens, brothels and unlicensed dentistry.But by the time the Canadian photographer made his first visit to the “thriving” city in 1986, triad control had waned and these characterizations were, he said, “very out of date.”“It might have been true at one time,” he added. But his enduring memory of the place was the community that lived there. “You quickly realize that it’s just a place where folks are trying to get by, like any other working-class part of Hong Kong.”Girard was determined to demystify the so-called “City of Darkness,” particularly after the colonial government announced plans in 1987 to demolish it. He spent four years documenting the Walled City with fellow photographer Ian Lambot, with the pair eventually publishing a book of their images in 1999.Early on, Girard decided to photograph the series in color and used portable lighting equipment — similar to the kind he used to capture celebrities and CEOs for glossy magazine portraits.“The only pictures you saw of the Walled City at the time tended to be in black and white, and they made the place look as bad as possible, in keeping with the reputation of the Walled City as a dangerous, squalid slum,” said Girard. When it came to capturing people’s day-to-day lives, and images of residents, shopkeepers and factory owners, the photographer wanted to use “a more even-handed approach,” he added.Girard documented, among much else, the blurred chaos of noodle and fish ball factories, a young child inspecting his grazed knee on the counter of his family’s grocery store, and a barber curling a client’s hair. While initial reactions to his presence were often frosty (“there was a palpable unwelcomeness to outsiders,” he recalled), residents eventually allowed him into their cramped apartments.His guiding principle, Girard said, was “to try to show it for what it really was, since rumor and myths were the only things that were known about the place.”When the Walled City was razed, from 1993 to 1994, that was supposed to be the end of it. But in the decades since, the enclave has arguably garnered more interest than it ever did while standing. In 2014, Girard and Lambot published a “revisited” edition of their book that explored the city’s legacy in popular culture — including as an inspiration for fictional dystopias in video games and films, such as “Call of Duty: Black Ops” and “Batman Begins.”“The Walled City was this jumping-off point for an imaginary city where the normal rules don’t apply,” said Girard.There has been renewed interest in architectural circles, too: The unregulated, organic construction that made Kowloon Walled City a “dystopia” to live in is now being examined as a source of innovation due to its resourceful use of limited space and cheap or second-hand materials, said Girard.“The limitations of that place certainly spurred a lot of creative responses, in building terms, to (the question of) what to do in a place that no one cares about, or pays attention to, except the residents,” Girard added.The site of the Walled City has since been transformed into a public park, which opened in 1995. Quiet and uncrowded, it is in many ways the opposite of what it replaced, providing a much-needed reprieve from the clamor of a city desperately short on public space. Open-air chess pavilions and banyan-shaded ponds surround the old yamen building, a relic of the 19th-century Chinese garrison city that once stood on the site and the only structure to survive the demolition.Inside the building, Girard’s famous rooftop photo is blown-up to fill an entire wall, accompanied by an audio track of children laughing and the roar of airplane engines. The memory of a vibrant community — immortalized by photographers like Girard — lingers.Ongoing interest in the Walled City is, Girard suggests, because of the spirit it encapsulates: the aptitude for survival even in the harshest of circumstances. “It still continues to fascinate,” he said. “And that’s wonderful.”"

        "category": "style",
        "text": "While there was an abundance of daring looks at the Oscars red carpet this year, one of the evening’s most memorable outfits came from Hollywood newcomer Sandra Hüller. The German actor’s arresting performances in “Anatomy of a Fall” and “The Zone of Interest” — two movies nominated for the Best Picture Oscar — have placed her front and center in the celebrity machine, and her red carpet style is pressing all the right buttons.Hüller arrived on Sunday night in a custom black velvet Schiaparelli hourglass gown, cinched at the waist and outstretched at the shoulders. The surrealist, winged, off-the-shoulder structure was topped off with a central, padlock detail, a “Reflection de Cartier” necklace in white gold set with 392 diamonds and a slicked-back ponytail. The vertiginous silhouette — though difficult to pull off — was so nice, Hüller essentially wore it twice. Later that night at the Vanity Fair after-party, the actor stunned in another custom Schiaparelli frock with a sculptural winged neckline: This time in a buttery velvet and embroidered with rhinestones.“It’s been so fresh and fun to look at a piece through Sandra’s eyes because of the level of excitement she brings,” Hüller’s stylist, Jordan Johnson Chung, told Vogue.But if the Oscars were your entry point to Hüllers house of cerebral fashion, don’t stop there. The Academy Award-nominated actor — last week revealed as the face of fashion designer Phoebe Philo’s 60-piece second drop — has been storming the red carpet for months, offering up a range of refreshing looks, from the collarless, sequined Louis Vuitton suit (topped off with a tousled shag haircut) she wore to the 2024 Cesar Film Awards earlier this month to the thigh-high maroon Bottega Veneta boots she donned for an appearance on Jimmy Fallon.Scroll down to see Hüller’s sharpest sartorial moments."

        "title": "A new documentary wrestles with the highlights — and lowlights — of John Galliano’s controversial career",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "After a first intervention for the fashion house’s seismic creative director John Galliano failed, Dior’s then-CEO Sidney Toledano staged a second, more serious one. It was February 2011, shortly before Galliano was set to debut what would become his final collection for Dior at Paris Fashion Week, and the designer was summoned to appear before Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH, Dior’s parent company.In their conversation, Arnault stressed that if Galliano did not stop binge drinking, he would die. In response, as Toledano recounts in the new documentary “High & Low: John Galliano,” the then-50-year-old gym-obsessive ripped open his shirt to reveal a rippling torso and said, “Does this look like the body of an alcoholic?”And so the designer’s drinking and pill-popping rolled on. But just days before the Paris Fashion Week show, Galliano was accused of making antisemitic comments at fashionable watering hole La Perle, in the French capital’s Jewish quarter. Video of a second, separate incident at the bar — filmed a few months earlier — then surfaced in British tabloid “The Sun.” It showed a visibly inebriated Galliano verbally accosting patrons, spewing antisemitic insults and saying, to nobody in particular, “I love Hitler.”Galliano was swiftly fired by Dior and disgraced in the global press. (His final collection was shown without him.) He was found guilty in court of two counts of antisemitic behavior; after paying a 6,000 euro (then $8,415) fine, he decamped to a remote location to find solace. For years, he remained largely out of the spotlight.But in the annals of contemporary “cancel culture,” Galliano’s downfall — though it predated the phenomenon by some years — is an entry that perhaps warrants closer inspection. At least, “High & Low” director Kevin Macdonald, whose documentary performs a thrilling autopsy of Galliano’s career collapse, thinks so.“During lockdown, I’d been reading (about) everybody being canceled, one after another. And it set me to thinking about forgiveness and when and how people are forgiven,” Macdonald told CNN. “Somebody mentioned to me, ‘What about Galliano?’”A friend introduced him to Galliano, and once he saw the designer’s desire to tell his side of the story, Macdonald approached Anna Wintour — Galliano’s “protector,” the Scottish filmmaker said — for her blessing. (Wintour even agreed to appear in the documentary herself.)“One of the things I’ve (encountered), particularly in the US, is people who were like, ‘I don’t want to see a film about an anti-Semite,’” Macdonald said. “I’m like, ‘Well, I don’t know if he is. Maybe he’s not. But shouldn’t we try and understand him and shouldn’t we try and see where that came from?’“I’m not put off by moral ambiguity and complex characters. And that was the thing that made me interested in John — there aren’t easy answers.”As its title suggests, “High & Low” scrutinizes the designer’s extraordinary rise and dramatic flameout. Seemingly addicted to ambition and paid to conjure, in clothes, exotic dreams and transportive visions, Galliano appears to have been peeled away from reality like a shell from a boiled egg. At his creative height, he was producing more than 30 collections a year across both Dior and his namesake label. His assistants had assistants. He did not personally know how to use an ATM. “After every collection, he would crash. He would totally crash,” Johann Brun, an early financial backer of the Galliano label, says in the film.“On the surface, John was told, ‘Do you want to take over the advertising of the perfume? Do you want to take over the watches?’” Macdonald said. “John, being an obsessive control freak, would be like, ‘Yes, yes, yes.’”“I was committing suicide slowly,” Galliano admits at one point in the documentary. “I just wanted to sleep forever.”In one standout scene, Galliano recounts his father’s passing, three days before a Dior Haute Couture show. Toledano proffered a jet to fly Galliano to the burial — and return that same evening, so he could resume fittings.“There’s a madness to it,” Macdonald said of the incident, adding: “And you can see that at the end of that show, where he’s totally drunk and he’s being allowed to give an interview in his office. He’s devastated because his father’s dead, but he’s conflicted because he didn’t think he liked his father. He keeps going about how grateful he is to Mr. Toledano for sending a jet… And you’re thinking, ‘It doesn’t actually sound that great that you didn’t have time off.’ But I would say that if you’d asked John then, he would say, ‘I don’t want time off. I want to keep working.’”That work is on full display throughout “High & Low” — the Victorian princesses, the roving gypsies and the “Eskimo and Mongolian hotties,” as Galliano described them in the stage notes for his Fall-Winter 2002 show “Esquimaux.” Perhaps no other fashion documentary has used archival footage so fittingly to illustrate the madcap genius of a figure whom fashion critic Tim Blanks once referred to as “the Cecil B. DeMille of fashion.”Returning to a place of trust and acceptance in the fashion industry required Galliano to take a pilgrimage of penance. As part of his years-long quest for reconciliation, the designer met with Jewish people — including a rabbi and a holocaust survivor — who could help him understand the gravity of his offensive comments.Galliano hoped that, through this atonement, he would be given a second chance — and he was. Still, Macdonald would like his audience to remember that his outbursts had direct victims, one of whom he interviews in the film and who decidedly does not forgive Galliano. (“That was shocking and surprising to me — that the real victim of this actually has been forgotten,” the filmmaker said.) But he offers, without judgment, all one needs to come to their own conclusion about this public figure and his very public failings.It was Kate Moss who first brought Galliano back into the fashion fold, asking him to design a wedding dress for her 2011 marriage to Jamie Hince. His first official post-Dior position was as designer-in-residence at Oscar de la Renta in 2013; he was installed as creative director at Maison Margiela the following year. His collections received some attention, though the sartorial theatrics he was known for were tamped down to match the house’s avant-garde approach.It wasn’t until Galliano’s recent Spring-Summer 2024 Haute Couture collection for Margiela that he made a cultural impact equivalent to that of his halcyon days, reviving the iconic Brassaï doll aesthetic he previously presented at Dior’s Fall-Winter show in 2007. Men and women were cinched at the waist, teetering on heels, bursting with padding and furnished with chest plates; faces were glazed over by makeup artist Pat McGrath to create a porcelain finish.“I want to take all the credit, of course,” Macdonald said jokingly of the collection, Galliano’s first since filming wrapped.Before one of Galliano’s regular interviews for the film, Macdonald showed the designer a series of clips from his previous fashion shows “He started to shake, uncomfortable and nervous, smoking… He said, ‘It takes me back to the feeling of obsession that I was in the grip of then, which connects to the addiction. It connects to the excess and the bad behavior,’” the director recalled. “There was something really tragic about it. We’re looking at it going, ‘Wow, that’s crazy. It’s beautiful.’ And he’s looking at it, and it’s actually making him feel sick.”“I think there was something cathartic about making the film — talking about all of this in great detail, knowing that it was going to be in public, watching the interviews that I did with other people — that has allowed him to move on from it in a way that maybe he hadn’t before,” Macdonald said of Galliano, who has not commented publicly on the film. “But you’d have to ask him.”"

        "title": "A tech company is growing diamonds in the desert",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Diamonds are the hardest material on Earth — and finding one in nature is comparably tough.For thousands of years, humans have dug deep into the Earth in search of diamonds, creating some of the world’s largest manmade pits in Russia and South Africa that descend as much as 625 meters (2,050 feet) below the ground.The intensive process has an impact on both nature and people, with dangerous working conditions and practices that damage ecosystems.But mining isn’t the only way to source diamonds. The first lab-grown diamond (LGD) was produced in the 1950s, according to the International Gem Society, and the technology has continued to develop, enabling labs to grow gem-quality crystals at affordable prices — up to 80% cheaper — without the sustainability and ethical concerns of mining.And growing diamonds artificially means you can bring diamond production to the most unexpected places — including the desert.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a global leader in diamond imports and exports, but it does not have any diamond mines. So entrepreneur Mohamed Sabeg saw an opportunity to not just trade diamonds, but grow them.In 2022, he co-founded Dubai-based 2DOT4 Diamonds, becoming the first to produce, cut, and polish lab-grown diamonds in the UAE.“Our idea was to bring the mine to the consumer,” says Sabeg. “Instead of having diamonds flying all around the world, the diamond is produced and sold locally.”The company’s name, 2DOT4, comes from the refractive index of a diamond —the speed at which light passes through a diamond compared to air, which is approximately 2.4 times slower.For Sabeg, having a name that relates to a physical property of the gem is a representation that the pieces produced in a lab are identical to the ones in nature.“The only difference is that we control the pressure, we control the heat, we control the gases,” he says. “The mined diamond, you don’t control it, the Earth is doing it.”To grow a diamond, you start with a diamond, either lab-grown or mined, explains Sabeg. It’s called a “seed” and is usually around 0.3 to 0.6 millimeters thick. (2DOT4 makes its own seeds from the diamonds grown in-house.)Placed inside a reactor, the seed is exposed to gases such as hydrogen, methane, oxygen, and argon. It also undergoes a pressure of up to 180 torrs —around two-thirds of the pressure at the peak of Mount Everest — and reaches temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees Fahrenheit). In this way, carbon is slowly deposited onto the thin slice.Then, it’s a matter of time for it to grow in volume.“You decide the speed of growth by using different parameters: the lower your speed is, the better your quality will be,” explains Sabeg.On average, 2DOT4 grows its diamonds at a speed of around 0.01 millimeters per hour. This means that every 24 hours, the stone grows in length comparable to the thickness of two sheets of paper.Once the diamond has grown to at least five millimeters in height, the piece is called a “block,” and there are three possible outcomes. It can be sliced into more seeds, that will be fed back into the reactors to grow more diamonds. Or, based on demand, 2DOT4 will cut and polish the gem. It can then either be sold to jewelers and designers, or turned into a jewelry piece designed in-house.Currently, the US, China, and India dominate LGD production, with the latter two accounting for over two-thirds of global output, according to Paul Zimnisky, a diamond industry analyst and consultant based in the US.Besides jewelry, lab-grown diamonds are used in multiple industries, particularly when it comes to making tools that cut through dense materials such as concrete, marble, and metals.For example, China has “a multi-decade legacy of producing synthetic diamond for abrasive industrial application, so they have the know-how and the infrastructure to be a major producer of man-made diamond for jewelry as well,” explains Zimnisky.India, on the other hand, has been a long-standing leader in diamond cutting and polishing, and embraced LGD technology to jump into production, too. Last year, the country underwent a tax reform in the sector and pledged extra funding to further expand its man-made diamond industry.Given the UAE’s status as a top diamond trading hub and its diversification efforts away from oil, expanding into the lab-grown diamonds industry could be an important move for its economy, says Ahmed Bin Sulayem, CEO and executive chairman of the Dubai Multi Commodities Center (DMCC), a global trade hub that held the very first Lab-Grown Diamond Symposium.“With the rise of the LGD industry symbolizing the intersection of technology and trade, the potential it holds is monumental, [and] we are excited to see Dubai positioned as a pioneering force in this transformative era,” says Bin Sulayem.“Sixty years ago, if you tell someone this is a synthetic or a lab-grown diamond, they won’t even look at it,” he adds. But younger generations are more concerned about ethical and environmental issues associated with mining, and are drawn towards the affordability of luxury goods, “so the industry has to adapt,” he adds.Entering the LGD production space could be a challenge, though. According to Zimnisky, competing with India and China will be difficult at scale, “unless you have a competitive advantage, or have a niche or specialized business.”Other UAE companies are following 2DOT4 and setting up their LGD business in Dubai, including Eviqe Diamonds, a part of HRA Group, which set up its production facility in the Emirate just a few months ago. Meanwhile, local brands such as Etika and Eayni are marketing their designs using lab-grown gems only.For the DMCC, the goal is to encourage the entire production to be done in-house, as a way of adding value to the final product and strengthening the local industry.“The key message we are giving to the lab-grown diamond industry is, don’t waste your time on selling the diamonds: focus on the final art,” says Bin Sulayem.For Sabeg, the hope is that 2DOT4’s creations are laying the foundation for the future of LGD production in a country that currently imports more diamonds than anywhere else in the world.“Our way of looking at what we are doing is to set a standard in the industry,” he says."

        "title": "How this photographer makes sublime landscapes of the American West",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "The first time Reuben Wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast, open skies of the American West, he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus.The British visual artist, now based in Chicago, has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting, enhancing craggy peaks with halos, or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity. But for a long time, art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth-pop band Ladytron.“(Photography) started as an all-consuming hobby,” he explained in a phone interview. But when Ladytron took a break in 2011 after five studio albums (they released a self-titled sixth album in 2019, and the seventh, “Time’s Arrow,” this month), he began a new career from scratch. “While the others did their own solo projects, making their own music and releasing their own albums, this was my solo project.”Wu’s imagery takes a classic photographer’s combination — light and landscape — and marries the two in transformative ways. He often begins with dusky evening light or the ink-black shadows of night, then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom-built consumer drones. In one image, a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky. In a different motion piece, Wu simulated an electrical storm in Goblin Valley, Utah, but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning.The artist’s 2018 photo book “Lux Noctis” is in the collections of the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and he has shot commercial work for Apple, Audi and Google as well as the DJ and music producer Zedd. Last summer, Wu revealed a colossal project for National Geographic: a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about Stonehenge, which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones. In November, one of his NFTs, a 4K video loop titled “An Irresistible Force,” outperformed its high estimate by over 25% during an auction at Sotheby’s Hong Kong, selling at 441,000 HKD (about $56,500).“I couldn’t have dreamed of where I am now,” Wu said. “I just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography.”Wu has always been drawn to wild, remote places where he could find solitude. His parents immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK before he was born, and he grew up an introverted child in Liverpool, he said, who didn’t quite click with school. He was fascinated with science-fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday, such as Steven Spielberg’s “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” which featured Wyoming’s Devils Tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact. (Unfamiliar with American topography, he initially thought the butte, a national monument, was a fictional geological entity, he explained with a laugh).The film’s visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work. “(It’s) cemented into my brain, the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky, kind of like search lights on very ordinary (American) landscapes,” he said.He embarked on his first cross-country photography trip across the US in 2013, around a decade after getting a taste on the road with Ladytron. The resulting series featured vivid depictions of the Grand Canyon and South Dakota Badlands, as well as a time-lapse image of Devils Tower at night among star trails.Two years later, Wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot.“I flew the drone up above some cliffs, and I was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape,” he explained. It made the cliffs glow, reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially.Wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project. The first iteration, he said, which he used when the technology was still nascent, was a “massive” eight-rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time. The next used a 3D-printed bracket with an LED hot light, but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air. The tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room, with a half hour to fly out, capture images and return to him, but he’s had to learn to work within the bounds of each set-up.“I’m a lot less anxious now, because I’ve crashed a number of drones,” he said. “And in the end, they’re just tools.”After developing series of still images such as “Lux Noctis” and “Aeroglyphs,” which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies, Wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music. He began creating 15-second video loops from his images, showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky, to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced.“These (works) were very much experimental and had no end goal — they were just things that I did for love out of love,” he said. “I couldn’t license them, I couldn’t print them… and so they were just there, stacking likes on my Instagram.”But in January 2021, Wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to NFT art. He minted his first “non-fungible token” on the marketplace Foundation two months later — an “aeroglyph” of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff. It sold for 30 ETH ($45,000), a portion of which he donated to the National Parks Conservation Association and the AAPI Community Fund. Later that year, the web3 arts organization Obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled “Aeroglyph Variations,” which took him into the New Mexico badlands for a 20-hour shoot that resulted in 55 images of the same setting, each with different lighting conditions and patterns. Wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways, from animations, to AR experiences, to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints.“It’s very much a hybrid medium, and so I’d like to expand that horizon even more, and think about the end goal for my work,” he said. “Am I creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate, or am I creating an experience for people to share?”Wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes, but no matter the medium, his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent.“A lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly — that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work,” he said. “But I’m not trying to create an alien-looking image; I’m trying to show that this is our planet. And there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective.”"

        "title": "Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s sons publish unfinished novel that the late author wanted ‘destroyed’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Gabriel García Márquez’s last novel, “Memories of My Melancholy Whores,” was published 20 years ago, but the late Colombian author’s legacy did not end there.After his death in 2014, an unfinished work — consisting of up to five drafts that the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature was working on during the last years of his life — remained in storage at his personal archive at the University of Texas.On Wednesday, the day García Márquez would have turned 97, the now-finished novel, “Until August,” was published by the author’s sons Rodrigo and Gonzalo García.But, as the pair acknowledge in the book’s preamble, García Márquez didn’t want the work to be released. “This book doesn’t work,” they recall their father telling them before his death. “It must be destroyed.”Having reviewed the manuscripts, his family determined that they contained the essence of the writer who has captivated so many readers for decades. In the book, García Márquez’s sons admit that publishing it was an act of “betrayal.” But Gonzalo told a press conference Tuesday that nothing had been added that was not included in the various drafts of the novel left by his father.“The novel was a little scattered in a certain number of originals, but it was complete,” he said, as the brothers presented the book at the Cervantes Institute in Madrid.“It is not as polished as his greatest books,” Rodrigo added: “But, as we say in the prologue, it definitely has many of (his) outstanding characteristics: beautiful prose, knowledge of the human being, power of description.”García Márquez worked on the novel for several years until he began to suffer from dementia. The Colombian author’s memory loss undermined his confidence in his work, his sons said.“He never kept unpublished books,” said Rodrigo. “Every book that he did not finish and that he was not satisfied with was destroyed. So, the fact that he did not destroy this book, I think, is also a sign that it became a little indecipherable for him. A Gabo (as García Márquez was affectionately known) completely in his right mind would have either finished the book, or destroyed it.”Set in an unidentified Caribbean location, “Until August” follows protagonist Ana Magdalena Bach as she makes an annual trip to the island where her mother is buried. Each year, while there, she “for one night takes a new lover,” according to a synopsis from the book’s publisher Penguin Random House, which described the novel as a “profound meditation on freedom, regret, self-transformation, and the mysteries of love.”The posthumous novel emerged from the manuscripts thanks to the fine-tuning of publisher and literary agent Cristóbal Pera, who edited the last two books García Márquez published during his lifetime.García Márquez’s sons have confirmed that there are no other unfinished novels in storage. “All of Gabo’s work is now available to his readers,” said Gonzalo."

        "title": "Is it time to revolutionize the toilet?",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Consider the toilet — that humble porcelain bowl that spirits away our waste several times a day. It’s not a piece of technology that often gets flashy updates (though dual flushing, seat warming and electronic bidet features can certainly elevate it), nor is it a darling of the design world.But toilets are in desperate need of an upgrade — as is our entire approach to sewage, according to the many designers, environmental engineers and sanitation experts hoping to bring about a paradigm shift.Flushing our waste is, well, wasteful, accounting for nearly a third of indoor water use in US homes, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In many parts of the world, the use of water toilets has become increasingly fraught as climate change ushers in extreme droughts and flooding, which backs up sewers and overflows septic tanks. In disaster zones, or places without access to running water, the need for innovation is even more urgent.Rethinking how we deal with waste may also present an opportunity: Our excrement can be converted into renewable heat, electricity and fertilizer.“Waste is not waste, it’s a resource,” said Arja Renell, a Finnish artist and architect who brought the topic to last year’s Venice Architecture Biennale as the curator of her country’s pavilion. She wasn’t an expert in the field, but had been alarmed to learn that some of Venice’s wastewater is flushed directly into its canals and wanted to demonstrate a circular approach to sanitation: the “dry” toilet.Known as a “Huussi” in Finnish, the dry toilet separates urine from stool and is ventilated to keep odors out — In Finland, dry toilets are particularly prevalent in rural summer cottages, Renell told CNN in a video call. Users layer the contents of the toilet’s bin with peat or sawdust after doing their business; once full, they move the excrement to a larger airtight container over the course of several months so that any microorganisms die out.The remaining material, rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, can be used as natural fertilizer rather than the usual greenhouse gas-emitting synthetic kind.The dry composting method will be familiar to those with off-grid homes. In the US, dry compost toilets have long been built as alternatives to flush toilets in rural homes that aren’t connected to a sewage system, or by people who can’t afford to install a neutralizing septic tank, which can cost thousands of dollars. Kelsey McWilliams, an environmental engineer who builds circular sanitation systems around the country with her company Point of Shift, said the need for sustainable solutions will only grow in drought- or flood-stricken areas.“There are multiple states right now where people are working on changing the current building codes to allow not only compost toilets, but more innovative solutions for people who want them,” she told CNN. “Septic tanks are great — they served a purpose. They’re a very old type of technology, and they still generally protect our wells from human waste and bacteria. But there are better solutions.”Expanding the use of dry compost toilets poses formidable challenges, however, from state- or county-level regulations right down to personal preferences. They can be difficult to install in urban settings and hard to maintain in anything larger than a single-family home. There’s also the matter of time: Waiting up to a year for waste to be safely recycled will deter many people — and the ick factor may be hard to shake.“It’s asking people to care about something that they’re biologically attuned to be averse to,” McWilliams said.But what if your poo could, for the most part, disappear from your toilet? That’s the question being asked by Change:WATER Labs, a startup led by scientist and entrepreneur Diana Yousef which is patenting an evaporative material that aims to reduce the volume of waste build-up by as much as 97% in a single day.“We have developed a technology that we lovingly term ‘shrink wrap for crap,’” Yousef explained on a phone call.Change:WATER Labs’ low-cost and entirely waterless portable toilet, dubbed the “iThrone,” stores human waste in a pouch lined with the proprietary material. What’s left still needs to be collected and treated — it’s recycable, but not neutralized — but only needs to be retrieved once every one to two months, Yousef said. (Imagine a porta-potty after that long, for context.)Since receiving funding in 2018 from the Humanitarian Grand Challenge, an international acceleration award, the iThrone has been piloted in vulnerable communities without access to safe sanitation in Uganda and Panama. Change:WATER Labs hopes to scale up the project. Last year, the WHO and UNICEF’s Joint Monitoring Programme estimated that around 3.5 billion people — 43% of the world’s population — have no access to a toilet or latrine connected to wastewater treatment or safe disposal. Nearly a billion of those people use unsafe pit latrines or buckets, or defecate in the open.“When you shrink the waste at the point of production, essentially, you do a better job of containing it hygienically, so it cleans up communities.” Yousef said. “But then on top of that you are not using, or polluting, any water.”Though the current version of the iThrone doesn’t yet put excrement to good use, future versions may be able to turn evaporated moisture from urine or feces into potable water, or convert the remaining stored waste into renewable energy, according to Yousef, who said the product will “get more sophisticated” with time.“I don’t think anyone living in a house with a flush toilet is within five or 10 years of saying, ‘Yeah, I want to give that up,’” she said. “But there are so many other applications. And they’re not all just for low-income or distressed, fragile populations. There’s public sanitation, green building, transportation. And there are so many places where people are tied to septic tanks.”In cities with developed sewer systems, radical change may take place out of sight. As California deals with worsening drought, for example, San Francisco now requires new buildings larger than 100,000 square feet to have onsite wastewater recycling systems. Local startup Epic Cleantec, which built the city’s first graywater reuse system in the luxury high-rise Fifteen Fifty, is bringing its system to residential developments, corporate campuses, factories and hotels around the state.At a new coastal development in the Swedish city of Helsingborg, meanwhile, a traditional sewage plant has been completely revamped into an innovative new treatment facility called RecoLab (which is short for “Recovery Lab”). A striking, building that ventilates high in the air, to keep odors at bay, RecoLab connects to every building in the new district through a three-pipe system that separates and recycles water containing human waste (or blackwater) from low-water vacuum-based toilets, graywater from bathtubs and washing machines, and organic matter from food disposal systems. By 2030, when the housing development is complete, RecoLab will serve 2,500 residents.“When you’re ‘source-separating’ the wastewater, it’s the same principle as when you’re separating plastic from metal — it’s easier to recycle,” explained Amanda Haux, business developer at RecoLab.“Ninety-four percent of the wastewater in our cities is actually very easy to clean,” she said, but mixing in blackwater contaminates what could be a reusable resource.As with dry composting toilets, RecoLab extracts nitrogen and phosphorus from human waste — as well as from food compost — and turns them into fertilizer pellets at a nearby factory. Biogas from recycled waste is converted into heating, while recycled water is used in the community swimming pool. As of now, the plant does not recycle graywater, due to strict Swedish government regulations on repurposing wastewater for drinking. But Haux is hoping that will change, particularly in municipalities where water shortages may become more common due to climate change.To demonstrate the project’s circularity, Haux hopes to eventually open a rooftop garden and restaurant on RecoLab’s premises, using its recycled fertilizer and water to grow ingredients. “The purpose is to raise awareness about wastewater as a resource. We shouldn’t hide it away in our cities,” she said. “This is actually a low-hanging fruit when we’re talking about circulation.”At the Venice Biennale, Renell invited Haux to talk about RecoLab in a fall seminar on new approaches to waste. The humble dry toilet and a large-scale urban sewage system may be at opposite ends of the spectrum, but they are both solutions to the same problem.“So many people get so excited about this topic,” Renell said. “Of course, the urban scale feels a bit more daunting, but even within that, there are these amazing examples going on.”“Going to the toilet needs to be quite simple,” Renell said. “If we want to compete with the with the current system, we need to provide something equally easy.”"

        "text": "Billie Eilish, Finneas, Mark Ruffalo, Ava DuVernay, Ramy Youssef and Quannah Chasinghorse are among the latest stars to step onto the red carpet in matching red lapel pins — this time at the Academy Awards. And though he did not walk the carpet, actor Mahershala Ali also donned one of the pins when helping introduce the nominees for this year’s Best Supporting Actor award. But what do they mean?Featuring an outline of a hand around a black heart, the pins call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, which Palestinian health authorities say has resulted in 30,000 deaths in Gaza since October. A group of over 400 celebrities have joined Artists4Ceasefire, a campaign that in late October published a letter urging the US Congress and President Joe Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel.In a press statement, Artists4Ceasefire said: “The pin symbolizes collective support for an immediate and permanent cease-fire, the release of all of the hostages and for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza.”But in contrast to other symbolic accessories like the Time’s Up movement, which became ubiquitous at awards shows in 2018 to show support for victims of sexual harrassment, the ceasefire pins have only been seen on a handful of stars on recent red carpets. At this year’s Grammy Awards, Boygenius and Annie Lennox notably wore the pins, with Lennox pleading for a ceasefire and peace onstage.(Also on the Academy Awards red carpet, actors Milo Machado-Graner and Swann Arlaud or “Anatomy of a Fall” wore pins featuring the Palestinian flag.)On the Oscars red carpet on Sunday, Youssef, a comedian and actor who co-starred in “Poor Things” alongside Ruffalo and Emma Stone, expressed frustration with the lack of momentum for an end to the war.“There’s no other route,” Youssef told Variety of calling for a ceasefire. “It’s taking so long… That’s what we’re all encouraging everyone to be vocal about.”Other stars who signed the Artists4Ceasefire letter include Cate Blanchett, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez, Bradley Cooper and America Ferrera."

        "title": "What happens when history is erased? An artist edits Civil Rights images to eerie effect",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "From the gospel song title “We Shall Overcome” emblazoned on banners and buttons during the Civil Rights era, to the last words of Eric Garner, “I Can’t Breathe,” used in marches and social media hashtags in 2014, protest slogans have often become rallying cries that help concretize history-making movements.But what if that messaging was inexplicably (or deliberately) erased from our records? That’s the version of history Houston-based artist Phillip Pyle II poses in the photographic series “Forgotten Struggle,” in which he presents provocatively edited pictures of Civil Rights protestors during the 1960s carrying blank white signs. The eerie negative space on their posterboard placards abstracts the images; while they are still broadly recognizable to anyone familiar with American history, much of the crucial context is lost.Several of Pyle’s images will be displayed at this year’s FotoFest Biennial in Houston, which opens March 9, but the artist began the series more than a decade ago in response to controversial social studies textbook changes made by the Texas State Board of Education. Since then, classroom curriculum has become a flashpoint around the country, with a tidal wave of new legislation in red states in recent years banning books and restricting topics related to race, racism and LGBTQ+ identity — and in Florida, even trying to cast some aspects of slavery in a positive light.“The whole point of ‘Forgotten Struggle’ is that these (events) happened and now they’re trying to be omitted,” Pyle said in a phone call. “So let’s just play along.”By creating a visual metaphor for the “whitewashing and erasure of history,” he added, he hopes to subvert the process by sparking even more interest in what appears to be censored in his images.FotoFest’s executive director, Steven Evans, said Pyle’s work “communicates really quickly and powerfully.” It was a natural fit for the biennial’s theme “Critical Geographies,” which explore how “space, place and communities are influenced by social, economic, ecological and political forces,” Evans explained in a phone call.The political battles being waged across education have reached a peak in Houston, where the state’s education agency took control of the city’s public schools — 274 in total — early last year, citing, in part, the consistent underperformance of a single high school. The takeover raised alarm over the state’s new power over its largest school district.“A lot of questions about agency are happening here and about what is being taught, how it’s being taught, how resources are being allocated,” Evans said. “So I think that at a very particular level in Houston, but also at a national and international level, (Pyle’s work) is speaking to the moment.”But Pyle’s images don’t just infer commentary on contested curriculum. For some, the images might bring to mind how misinformation spreads online, such as when internet users misattribute an image, edit out important context, or outright fake a photograph through AI. (Perhaps they also resemble blank-sign meme templates, a trope which can be endlessly updated to keep current with the internet discourse of the day.)For others, viewing the images could help place historical events in a contemporary context, be an opportunity to observe lesser-seen details, or the impetus to research the source material on their own.Pyle prefers some ambiguity, arguing that social media has created an environment where “everything can be very matter of fact” and rigid in its presentation. “You have to figure out for yourself what is going on here in this moment,” he explained of his work.“(I want) to talk about history in a way that’s not beating you over the head with history,” he added.At FotoFest, some of Pyle’s works will be printed large and mounted on the wall, while others will be presented in vitrines, the glass display cases that often present historical documents and artifacts in museums. But Pyle also thinks about how his images will live online, and how they might be viewed decades from now.“I want to create these things that enter the internet zeitgeist,” he said. “In the future, somebody will come across it and be like, ‘What happened to this historical photo?’”In that way, he hopes the work — and its glaring absences — will continue to raise questions long after our own lifetimes."

        "title": "Pritzker Prize 2024: Japanese housing pioneer Riken Yamamoto wins ‘Nobel of architecture’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "In the Pritzker Prize’s 45-year history, no country has produced more winners than Japan. And on Tuesday, 78-year-old Riken Yamamoto was named the ninth and latest Japanese laureate of an award often dubbed the “Nobel of architecture.”Best-known for innovative housing projects and educational institutions, Yamamoto is something of a surprise choice. But in a press statement announcing the decision, jury chair and former winner Alejandro Aravena described him as “a reassuring architect who brings dignity to everyday life.” He added: “Normality becomes extraordinary. Calmness leads to splendor.”Across a five-decade career, Yamamoto has dedicated himself to fostering community in Japan’s rapidly expanding cities. From housing projects that coax residents into spontaneous interactions to a glass-walled fire station that invites passersby to peer inside, his architecture appears intent on “blurring boundaries between its public and private dimensions,” a jury citation added.As such, Yamamoto has more in common with other recent winners of the Pritzker Prize — an award that increasingly favors socially-minded architects over the creators of iconic landmarks — than with the Japanese laureates of eras past.It is a point of difference tracing back to the early 1970s: While many of his avant-garde compatriots (most notably 1987 Pritzker laureate Kenzo Tange) advocated conceptual floating cities and grand “megastructures,” Yamamoto was driving across the continents with his mentor to see how people lived in villages around the world. Speaking to CNN ahead of Tuesday’s announcement, he described these formative journeys as “my starting point as an architect.”What Yamamoto found, whether in north Africa or central America, was that human societies were traditionally built around a fluid threshold between private and shared spaces — between villages and the households within them. In modern metropolises, however, this divide has become entrenched to the detriment of their inhabitants, he said.“In the city, we have very few communities — sometimes no community,” Yamamoto said on a video call from Yokohama, near Tokyo, where he founded his architecture firm more than 50 years ago.Social isolation is a concern for both architecture and urban planning. Yamamoto said that cities’ preference for zoning, which governs how land is used, often keeps daily life and commercial activity apart; soaring residential towers (or “tower mansions” as he called them, using a direct but fitting translation of the Japanese term for high-rise condos) meanwhile reinforce what he called the “one family, one house” system.“You can sometimes have 5,000 people living completely independently from the city, and the people inside (tower blocks) are independent of each other… most Japanese people believe this is the ideal living system. I don’t agree with that.”Yamamoto’s solution has been housing that encourages neighbors and the public to come together — a form of architectural intervention that “suggests rather than imposes,” as the Pritzker Prize jury put it.After designing a succession of private homes in his early career, Yamamoto completed his first social housing project, in the coastal city of Kumamoto, in 1991. Hoping to inspire a sense of openness, he arranged its 110 homes into 16 clusters around a tree-lined central courtyard. The central public space has no gates and can only be reached by passing through the housing blocks, a scheme designed to increase the likelihood of chance encounters.Elsewhere, the Shinonome Canal Court project in Tokyo saw Yamamoto connect six huge residential blocks with a second-floor deck comprising terraces and shared green spaces. Pangyo Housing in Seongnam, South Korea (which is among a handful of projects the architect completed outside Japan) also linked homes via communal decks, though the development boasted an altogether more radical design feature: glass walls on the ground level of each residence invited neighbors to look inside one another’s houses.Yamamoto acknowledged this could be seen as an afront to privacy. And, at first, residents felt like they were living in a “fishbowl,” the architect recalled. But over time, they warmed to the idea.“It became very popular, and people liked it … sometimes they use (the ground-floor space) as a gallery. Sometimes it’s the guest room. Sometimes it’s a place to drink and sometimes people gather there,” he said, adding that residents subsequently invited him to a community party at the complex. “I was really, really happy at that moment, because they agreed with my design.”The idea of transparency has informed much of Yamamoto’s oeuvre — and not only housing. The clear glass facade, walls and floors of the fire station he designed in Hiroshima offer pedestrians a rare glimpse inside an institution that, while publicly funded, often hides its inner workings. At the Saitama Prefectural University and Future University (in Koshigaya and Hakodate, respectively), soaring windows provide unobstructed views between classrooms and even departments in the hope of stimulating academic collaboration.If Yamamoto’s civic gestures sound like simple solutions to urban ills, maybe that’s because — by his own reckoning — they are: “It’s very easy to make a community space and public space,” he said, framing his ethos as a return to the way public space operated in medieval Europe or Edo-period Japan.And yet, politics and profit have sometimes stood in the way. Yamamoto expressed dismay that more than 30 years after completing his aforementioned housing project in Kumamoto, his vision of shops and cafes occupying its lower reaches has not yet come to fruition due to local zoning regulations. Perhaps a greater challenge, he added, comes from property developers accustomed to promoting the benefits of standalone private homes.“Of course, political support is very important. But I think developers (should) change their minds a little bit. They believe that ‘one house, one family’ is the best way. I propose to the developer: change the system.”First awarded to American architect Philip Johnson in 1979, the Pritzker Prize recognizes what it describes as architects’ “consistent and significant contributions to humanity and the built environment.”Yamamoto, who has also completed buildings in China and Switzerland, is the latest in a string of laureates recognized for their commitment to the public and civic realms.Last year’s award went to British architect David Chipperfield, who is best-known for cultural institutions like Des Moines Public Library in Iowa his reimagined Neues Museum in Berlin. In 2022, Francis Kéré became the first ever African laureate in recognition of a career designing schools, health centers and community facilities.The Japanese architect will be awarded with $100,000 and a bronze medallion."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Beyoncé has revealed she will be launching a hair care line on February 20. The 29-time Grammy winner made the announcement on Instagram, posting a cryptic video featuring apparent home movie footage of her mother’s salon Headliners, in Houston, Texas — where Beyoncé had her first job sweeping hair.A makeshift projector screen shows snippets of childhood videos; Beyoncé in a pink tracksuit wandering the salon floor, Tina Knowles dressed up for the evening, waving to the camera with her young daughter in tow, sporting a flourishing afro. “Hair is sacred,” read Beyoncé’s caption as she revealed the brand name, Cécred.Intermixed with her family’s archival footage are clips of hair washing, braiding and silk presses. Tina Knowles influence on her daughters career has been far-reaching — one of the first music videos Destiny’s Child shot was for their first number one hit “Bills, Bills, Bills,” (1999), a tale of a disillusioned, independent woman triumphantly cutting off the deadweight of her boyfriend. It was staged in a hairdressers.“There is power in community, and I saw that growing up the daughter of a salon owner,” Beyoncé told Harper’s Bazaar in 2021. “I was exposed to so many entrepreneurial women that I admired. Doctors, business owners, artists, teachers, mothers — they all came through my mom’s salon. I saw firsthand how a salon can be a sanctuary for women.”“I’ve seen how much Black women’s emotions are attached to our hair and beauty,” she told the magazine. “The beauty industry does not always understand these emotions and what we need. I want to build a community where women of all races can communicate and share some of those secrets, so we can continue to support and take care of each other. I want to give women a space to feel their own strength and tell their stories. That is power.”While details about what products Cécred will offer are yet to be shared, a trademark request filed in the summer of 2022 clears the company for production of hair care preparations, candles, vitamin supplements, electric hair styling tools, combs, hair accessories, pillow cases and four other goods and services categories.While the launch date is now imminent, keen fans of Beyoncé may recall that she teased this venture in May last year, telling her followers on Instagram about how she watched her mother at work: “Having learned so much on my hair journey, I’ve always dreamt of carrying on her legacy.”Beyoncé is not the first celebrity to recently enter the world of hair care. In 2019, Tracee Ellis Ross launched Pattern, a now-award winning natural hair line focused on “curl conscious and textured” customers. Two years later, “Friends” star Jennifer Aniston – whose shiny, face-framing layers became known as “The Rachel” haircut on TikTok – launched a line of vegan and cruelty free hair products called LolaVie."

        "title": "‘My beliefs haven’t changed’: From social housing to skyscrapers, architect Moshe Safdie is still an idealist",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "There are few buildings that have more drastically shaped a city’s image than Marina Bay Sands. Just as the Eiffel Tower and Burj Khalifa define the skylines of Paris and Dubai, the soaring three-tower resort, joined across the top by a horizontal “skypark” and the world’s most famous infinity pool, is an icon both in and of Singapore.In fact, the hotel-casino project is so successful that the man who designed it doesn’t even stay there.“It’s too noisy,” said Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. “I’m a swimmer and I can never get in the pool because there are so many people taking pictures.”Now resuming his once-frequent trips to Singapore amid easing travel restrictions, Safdie prefers the nearby Ritz-Carlton, where we meet for afternoon tea. (“I had a British mother,” he explained, “so I’m a sucker for scones and tea.”) At a top-floor table overlooking his best-known creation, he reflected on the sometimes-fraught task of designing contemporary landmarks.“It wasn’t on my mind as much as it was on their minds,” he clarified, recounting the call for design proposals issued by the city-state’s government in the mid-2000s. “They didn’t quite say the building should become the icon of Singapore, but they talked about it being iconic.“When we made the submission, I said, ‘Some buildings have the magic to become memorable and associated with a place.’ And I mentioned Sydney Opera House as the classic contemporary example. But, I said, ‘It’s a mystery what makes that happen.’”The trick, it transpired, was designing something striking yet simple. Constructing a 0.2-mile-long cantilevered roof terrace atop three skyscrapers required a feat of complex engineering but, at its most abstract, Marina Bay Sands can be sketched in four basic strokes. In Singapore Sign Language, the landmark is referenced by simply raising three fingers of one hand and resting another digit across the top. Visible for miles around, it appears on postcards and newscast backdrops. The structure also stars in the official Singapore Lego set, which the architect proudly displays at his office back in Somerville, Massachusetts.“That kind of stuff, you can’t quite plan for or design – it just happens,” he said of the building’s success. “But I’m very happy about it. It changed our lives in terms of the work we get.”Safdie’s eponymous firm is in high demand. In the years since Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010, he has realized almost 20 major projects. Among them are the serene Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas and a dual-tower residential complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka, that sees one high-rise lean dramatically against the other. The architect also bequeathed Singapore with another landmark in 2019: Jewel, a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex that attracts throngs of Instagrammers to Changi Airport each day thanks to its verdant indoor waterfall.Safdie has said he considers seeing finished projects in use to be among an architect’s greatest pleasures. He makes a point of visiting Jewel whenever he’s in Singapore. “I was concerned about how the plants were doing,” he said. “But I was relieved to see they’re thriving.”The architect is not in Singapore to indulge in past glories, however. In the days after our interview, he will inspect two new developments: a gardenesque office complex in the island’s west and a pair of residential towers on the upmarket Orchard Road. The latter features multiple skybridges – a recurring theme in Safdie’s work that was recently taken to new extremes in Chongqing, China, where he lay a gargantuan “horizontal skyscraper” (containing an infinity pool, restaurants and an indoor garden) atop four 820-foot-tall towers.Then there is the small matter of Marina Bay Sands’ second phase. The expansion plans feature, among other things, a fourth tower – though Safdie dismissed early suggestions that his iconic skypark might be extended to rest across its top. In any case, Singapore officials have expressed that he shouldn’t, in his words, “screw around” with an icon.Instead, the new tower will stand apart from the other three, forming “sort of an exclamation mark,” he explained, motioning punctuative strokes: “Boooom… boom.”At 84, Safdie shows little sign of slowing down. Other recent trips have taken him to Sao Paolo, Brazil, where his glass-roofed Albert Einstein Education and Research Center recently opened its doors, and to the Ecuadorian capital Quito, where his tree-covered Qorner Tower will do so later this year. Covid-19 eased the architect’s unrelenting travel schedule, but he used the downtime to pen a memoir, “If Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.” He said he felt it was “time to document things.”Published this week, “If Walls Could Speak” serves as a reminder that much of Safdie’s six-decade career has been dedicated to humbler pursuits – museums, memorials and social housing that reimagined how people might live in densely populated cities.Before Marina Bay Sands, his best-known project was his very first: Habitat 67, a radical 1960s housing development that saw hundreds of identical prefabricated concrete units stacked into clusters along Montreal’s Saint Lawrence River. Safdie’s dream that it would spark a wave of large-scale “Habitats” around the world proved overly optimistic. His attempts to repeat the feat in other cities, including New York, Toronto and Iran’s capital Tehran, have often been thwarted. Projects of such size require land, funding and political will, and Safdie’s book openly recounts times when all three were lacking.But the principles underpinning the experiment – that apartment dwellers should enjoy access to outdoor space, views in multiple directions and the opportunity to interact with nature and neighbors – defined his work thereafter.Born in 1938 in Haifa, then part of British-controlled Palestine, Safdie has credited much of this architectural ethos to his childhood. As a boy, he always lived in apartment buildings, first in a Bauhaus-style block on Haifa’s Mount Carmel and then at his family’s new home further up the hill. At the latter, he would enter via a bridge, while the famous Baha’i Gardens “almost functioned as my backyard,” he writes in “If Walls Could Speak.” One need not look far for the inspiration behind the skybridges and elevated urban gardens that have since characterized his oeuvre.Safdie moved to Canada with his parents aged 15. (In a neat turn of events, he departed Israel via Lod Airport, since renamed Ben Gurion Airport, where decades later he would design a terminal building.) It was in Montreal that Safdie decided to pursue architecture – and where he first grew his signature mustache. He attended the city’s McGill University and wrote a college thesis, “A Case for City Living,” outlining his vision for a flexible housing “system” that could be adapted to different contexts and climates.Those early ideas have long shaped Safdie’s outlook. They would shape his fortunes, too. After showing his college drawings to the influential modernist Louis Kahn, he secured an apprenticeship at the architect’s Philadelphia office. Soon after, he was offered the chance to put his ideas into practice at a scale unimaginable to most young graduates.Montreal was due to host the 1967 World Fair, or Expo 67. Despite having never completed a building, the then 24-year-old Safdie was asked by the event’s mastermind (and his thesis adviser), architect Sandy van Ginkel, to develop a master plan for the site. He was also tasked with building on his ideas, eventually proposing a village-sized development of some 1,200 prefabricated dwellings stacked 20 to 30 stories high. His meticulous placement of each factory-built module was calculated to maximize garden space, allow in sunlight and improve residents’ views. Interconnected pedestrian walkways and bridges lifted the urban realm above ground.Political and financial realities scaled back his design; the final Habitat 67 comprised just 154 apartments – made from 354 modules and stacked 12 stories high across three “clusters.” It was, nonetheless, a major statement. In a postwar world rethinking how to accommodate rapidly urbanizing populations, Safdie’s system of repeated modular forms offered a bold new model for housing. Three of the 20th century’s most important architects, I.M. Pei, Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson, toured the project together prior to its opening. Only when Johnson told Safdie that he had “outdone” the classical Italian architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi did he realize the project “was a game changer,” he recounted.Habitat 67 was not universally adored. A New Yorker cartoon, which Safdie also displays at his Boston office, poked “gentle fun” at the project by depicting a spade-wielding child stacking sand into similar formations. Various journalists and fellow architects were more barbed in their criticisms.“It’s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it,” Safdie mused. “But that’s been true of my career.”To define Safdie’s career by either his breakout success or the “megascale” projects of recent years would be to ignore much else in between.In the early 1970s, he opened an office in Jerusalem, a city whose urban fabric he has profoundly transformed. As well as designing major institutions like the Hebrew Union College and the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, he oversaw a full-scale rebuild of the destroyed Jewish Quarter and planned an entirely new city, Modi’in-Maccabim-Re’ut, about 15 miles to its northwest. At one point, he even considered running for mayor of Jerusalem.He has also built widely in North America, where his output spans from the meditative (a nondenominational chapel at the Harvard Business School) to the mammoth (Terminal 1 of Toronto’s Pearson Airport). A citizen of Israel, the US and Canada, Safdie may be best known in the latter for the National Gallery in Ottawa, a grand glass palace housing some of the country’s most treasured art.Despite earlier setbacks Safdie has, more recently, found fertile ground for his “Habitats” in Asia. In 2017, he completed the first phase of the sprawling Habitat Qinhuangdao – in the titular city, about 200 miles from Beijing – a series of 16-story “mini blocks” connected by garden bridges. Back in Singapore, Safdie’s pixelated Sky Habitat tower saw him stretch his familiar stacked forms high above the ground to maximize floor space on a comparatively small plot.In both cases – and throughout Safdie’s career – ideals articulated in the 1960s have been adapted to meet the realities of new sites and clients. Yet, the architect maintains that his approach to housing remains, fundamentally, the same.“The belief in apartments being rethought as houses, in having gardens for every apartment, in quality of life, in streets and communities and making buildings that belong to their culture – from the outset these were fundamental to my beliefs,” he said. “And they haven’t changed. If anything, they have reinforced themselves as years go by.”“I think, without bragging, there’s been consistency,” he added. “In fact, you could say I’ve not been dynamic enough, but I’ve been pretty consistent.”There were other high-profile proposals that never came to fruition. Among the most divisive was the Columbus Center, a pair of heavy-set towers once set to loom over Manhattan’s Central Park at Columbus Circle before plans were scrapped following 1987’s Wall Street crash (and amid vociferous criticism from the likes of Henry Kissinger and Jacqueline Onassis).But Safdie’s legacy will not be measured only by what was, or wasn’t, built. Many of the once-radical ideas he championed are now mainstream – something he can take an amount of credit for. For one, his fixation on plant life, a principle he dubbed “for everyone a garden” in a 1974 book of the same name, is now widely shared by younger architects. Urban gardens and “living walls” are now almost de rigueur for new large-scale developments.Plants do not always thrive, though. In his memoir, Safdie distinguishes between “significant plant life” and “sorry shrubs.” So-called biophilic architecture may now be all the rage, but it can be undone by insufficient planning or maintenance, leaving occupants with dying trees and even bug infestations. As such, Safdie welcomes the trend while cautioning again token gestures.“The idea of green buildings is a battle cry – everyone is for it,” he said. Making them work, however, is another matter altogether. “There’s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then, in the renderings, everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees. When you look (closer), you see there’s no preparation for the earth, there’s no depth – it’s a fantasy.”Prefabrication, championed by the architect since his college thesis, is also enjoying a renaissance. Just two miles away from Marina Bay Sands, for instance, a Singaporean design firm is overseeing two 630-foot-tall residential skyscrapers built from units constructed in a factory over the border in Malaysia.“For a long time, people totally gave up on (prefabrication),” Safdie said. “But now there is a real shortage of labor and skilled labor – not in China, because they’ve got an extraordinary workforce, and not in India, but everywhere else in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, in the West. So, anything that is labor-saving is now up for grabs.”Much else has changed since Safdie formed his architectural ideals. For one, he “never would have imagined” how densely populated cities would become in the past 50 years. “Programs change, lifestyles change, priorities change and technologies change,” the architect added.But what about him? Has his outlook changed, too? “My daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as I was,” the architect said. “I disagree with her.”Safdie is nonetheless aware that the lofty principles of his youth may not be shared by the casinos or corporate clients he often works for. Being an architect sometimes means serving “regimes you’re not in love with and business entities whose values are different to yours,” he noted.“Take the dilemma I had with Marina Bay Sands,” he said, motioning once more toward the window and our view of the complex from the Ritz-Carlton’s lounge. “On the one hand, the idea of doing a building that could promote ‘gaming’ – that’s a nice word for it, but ‘gambling’ is the reality – is almost immoral if you go there and see poor people with limited means wasting their money.“But, to me, that was 2% or 3% of the area of a project that… could show what the public realm could be in a city. And that took over from the issue that nagged me.“That’s compromise,” he concluded. “But the basic value, the idealism of the end product, has not diminished. Without it, I don’t know how you can be an architect.”“If Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture,” published by Grove Atlantic, is available now."

        "title": "French lawmakers approve bill penalizing fast fashion",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "France’s lower house of parliament on Thursday approved a bill seeking penalties on ultra-fast fashion products, sold by companies like China’s Shein, aimed at helping to offset their environmental impact.The bill calls for gradually increasing penalties of up to 10 euros ($11) per individual item of clothing by 2030, as well for a ban on advertising for such products.All voting lawmakers unanimously approved the bill, which will head to the senate before it can become law.The popularity of fashion retailers Shein and Temu — which scale up orders based on demand thanks to ultra-flexible supply chains — have disrupted the retail sector while established players like Zara and H&M continue to largely rely on predicting shoppers’ preferences.“This evolution of the apparel sector towards ephemeral fashion, combining increased volumes and low prices, is influencing consumer buying habits by creating buying impulses and a constant need for renewal, which is not without environmental, social and economic consequences,” the bill said.Shein said in a statement to Reuters that the clothes it produces meet an existing demand, which allows its rate of unsold garments to remain consistently in low single digits, whereas traditional players can have up to 40% waste.It added that the only impact of the bill would be to “worsen the purchasing power of French consumers, at a time when they are already feeling the impact of the cost-of-living crisis.”Writing on X, France’s environment minister, Christophe Béchu, described the bill as a “major step forward,” adding: “A big step has been taken to reduce the textile sector’s environmental footprint.”The bill comes as the French environmental ministry said it would propose a European Union ban on exports of used clothes, in a bid to tackle the worsening problem of textile waste.Last year, the country launched a repair scheme to encourage people to mend old clothes and shoes rather than throw them away. The French government pledged 154 million euros ($168 million) to the initiative, which reimburses shoppers up to 25 euros ($27.20) for every garment they have repaired. The non-profit group tasked with running the scheme, Refashion, says that 3.3 billion items of clothing, household linen and footwear went on the French market in 2022. At the time, the country’s ministry of ecology said that French people throw away 700,000 tons of clothes — two-thirds of which ends up in landfills — each year.Among the world’s most polluting industries, fashion accounts for between 3% and 5% of global carbon emissions, according to consultancy McKinsey’s State of Fashion report. Around half of all fibers produced by the industry are forms of oil-based polyester, the report added."

        "title": "Paris Fashion Week: Fashion, feminism and a fake Kate Moss",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Although Paris Fashion Week is usually the talk of the town — and every social network — this week the French capital was preoccupied with events more notable than clothing.In an historical vote on Monday — a few days ahead of International Women’s Day (March 8) — the French parliament enshrined the right to abortion into its constitution, the first country in the world to do so. As runway shows popped up in every neighborhood, hundreds also gathered at the city’s famed Trocadero in front of the Eiffel Tower, to follow the historic event on giant screens.Paris has been a theater of style and politics for decades, so it is intriguing to note the revival of late 60s fashion this week. Indeed, this season’s Saint Laurent show revived many aspects of the founder’s 1968 collections (which can currently be admired at the Saint Laurent Museum in the French capital) featuring thinly — but colorfully — veiled nudity. A sartorial manifestation of sexual freedom that coincided with the student revolts of May 1968 where women fought notably for reproductive rights — then, and now again.So if clothing embodies needs, desires and progress, what can be deduced from this week’s garments, shown at a time and place when sexual agency is once again taking center stage?On runways, the women conjured seemed to thrive towards new realities, possibilities and celebrations. Japanese label Undercover dedicated its collection to working mothers, as models marched with bags filled with groceries to the sound of a poem by movie director Wim Wenders, “Watching a working woman.” Balmain’s was an ode to older women, Ester Manas focused on women of all sizes, whilst Nina Ricci highlighted sexually emancipated gender roles. The Parisienne’s static archetype seemed to embrace less normative, narrow ideals towards a wider scope of lifestyles and choices.The week, all seemed possible — even living your life as a Kate Moss lookalike, as model Denise Ohnona showed when she fooled paparazzi and social media users alike as she marched down the Marine Serre runway. The sky’s the limit.If revivals and historical citations always come carrying reinvigorated meanings, this season’s love affair with retro chic was no exception.Rochas’s first collection by Alessandro Vigilante delved into the house’s 1930s archives. Presented in a boudoir-like setting, old-school glamour was on display. Think technicolor lace, satin lingerie, froissé (mussed up) velvet indoor pieces – as a way to tie back to “one’s imagination and to anticipate women’s desires” said the designer after the presentation, offering indulgent rather than flashy luxury.Chanel’s show was steeped into Deauville references, the French beach resort in Normandy where Coco first set foot in 1913. The seaside-inspired collection featured pinned up floppy hats, soft knitted suits and loose embroidered tweed, celebrating a sense of freedom of movement and mobility.As for Chemena Kamali’s debut for Chloé, the show cited the house’s early years in the 1970s, with flouncy blouses, sheer ruffled dresses and dangling golden jewelry merged with post-Y2K boho chic (Sienna Miller sat front row witnessing her own revival). For Kamali, this sought to communicate a message of unfiltered liberty and beauty. “I want to honor the forward-thinking spirit that Gaby Aghion pioneered when she founded the house more than 70 years ago,” she said in the show notes. “She wanted to liberate women and empower them to be daring and feel free.”A bejeweled, preppy Kristin Scott Thomas at Miu Miu, sex-bomb Farida Khelfa at Mugler. Carine and Julia Roitfeld side-by-side at the Victoria Beckham, show and Anna and Pat Cleveland next to Jerry Hall and Georgia Jagger at Chloé. Both front row and on runways, women of all ages were present.Moving away from a seemingly never-ending “kidulthood” ideal, older models sported all looks and genres, from the techno-infused at Balenciaga to dishevelled punky tailoring at Ottolinger, proving there is no age barrier to embracing subcultural trends.“Age is not something I think of, or which defines (my) woman’s style - to me she stands out by her attitude, her singularity, her eccentricity’’ said designer Charles de Vilmorin about his eponymous ready-to-wear debut, made of arabesque-adorned silk pieces.Are heritage houses targeting mothers and daughters through one same collection? At Loewe — like at Rabanne — the playful use of tartan could be read both as a simultaneous wink to heritage and grunge. At Dior, twisted classics — a trench-coat, but make it cropped, in leopard print, or splattered with the words “Miss Dior”— seemed to be both referencing Jackie O and Gossip Girl.Traditionally, showing interest in celebrities (“Les people” in Parisian slang) was a big no-no amongst the proudly snobby French fashion press. Yet, this season more than ever before, the true show was very much on the front row: Salma Hayek and Kim Kardashian chatting away at Balenciaga; Naomi Campbell and Penelope Cruz catching up at Chanel; Hari Nef, Emily Ratajkowski and Charli XCX striking a pose, seemed to be part of the spectacle itself. Not forgetting the K-pop stars gathering hordes of fans outside venues.It is a trend that points to a total shift in the French media landscape. Alexandre Maras, deputy editor-in-chief and head of social media of leading celebrity magazine Gala (its TikTok account amasses over 10m followers) said “editors once were reluctant to integrate celebrities in their coverage, but today, post-pandemic and with the rise of TikTok, every single title documents (a star’s) presence as it drives the most traffic. It has led the way to other celebrities, social media stars, sports players, and has changed the way we think of fame, and who we consider famous.”Pulling away from meme-like fashion that has ruled runways and TikTok alike, the quiet luxury movement continues apace.The Row’s show had a “no phones” policy. Debates on-line didn’t miss the point: What was it really about, discretion or elitism? Victoria Beckham entered a more conceptual, sculptural design phase that is anything but Insta-baiting. From Hermès to Carven’s debut by Louise Trotter or Dries Van Noten, the focus was on elevated minimalism for discreetly opulent wardrobes.“There is a sense that fashion is re-centering on ultra-luxury customers with private salon (events), (increased) discretion and private offers, inspired by the couture tradition of yesteryear,” said Sophie Abriat, fashion journalist at Le Monde newspaper’s magazine, M. “There is a return to classical, hushed opulence, suggesting a pre-21st century, ladylike Parisienne with a focus on quality’’ she added about wardrobes fit for only a few lifestyles and budgets.Sexy — not to say nude — was also part of the agenda, as Valentino, Saint Laurent and Givenchy opted for entirely sheer, dramatic formal evening wear. Clothing for women who needn’t worry about public transport.And then there is Creativity with a capital C, not only as displayed in the clothes, but everywhere else. “The creative part, (including) the set design, is the most luxurious part (of the show). Luxury is scarcity, it is something rare. And creativity is rare right now,” said Balenciaga creative director Demna after the show. With invites consisting of individually thrifted presents sent to guests, the collection was bathed in a soundtrack by musician (and husband) BFRND and featured floor-to-ceiling screens.At Acne, architectural molded dresses marched through a dystopian decor by Estonian artist and scupltor Vilu Jaanisoo made from recycled tires to accompany a collection quoting punk and S&M — fit for an art gallery as much as a red carpet.At Courrèges, the futuristic, deconstructed silhouettes circled around an inflated decor that appeared to breathe, co-created by set designer Rémy Brière, label artistic director Nicolas Di Felice, and creative studio Matière Noire. In creating these “moments,” shows become bespoke art performances, an unique experience that brings an added value for people present.“Form follows function,” architect Louis Sullivan wrote in 1886, and this guideline for designers has not lost its power to inspire.Today, that means understanding the daily needs of women as a starting point to innovation. At Marine Serre, stretchy night-meets-day bodycon pieces, complete with pizza boxes and a caddy as runway accessories, suggest clothes that follow various emergencies and cravings, round the clock.All best illustrated by McQueen, and Seán McGirr’s debut, who shuffled the archetypes, volumes and roles a woman might play within a day. And at Off-White, creative director Ib Kamara’s working woman, global and ageless, came with faux fur, maximalism, in playful, hybrid cuts, breaking boundaries, expectations and labels. Something familiar to Nicolas Ghesquière, who blew out his 10th candle as the head of Louis Vuitton — marking a decade of a fashion both futuristic and steeped in ancestral savoir-faire, as ubiquitous as its monogram. For busy women, multitasking women, women who can."

        "title": "The woman who helps actors get into character — in a very unconventional way",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "When Helena Bonham Carter walked onto the set of 2012’s Dark Shadows movie, she was stinking of bourbon whiskey and Gauloises cigarettes.Her character was a chain-smoking alcoholic psychiatrist, but Bonham Carter hadn’t gone “method”; she had simply spritzed herself with a bespoke fragrance created specifically for her by fragrance designer Azzi Glasser.Having met by chance at their children’s school gates in London, the two have collaborated on countless projects over the years, beginning with the 2009 period drama “Enid,” for which Glasser concocted a perfume that evoked “stale white face powder that immediately took me back to the 1950s,” recalled Bonham Carter who was playing author Enid Blyton.Glasser has also fashioned a dark blend of foxglove, poison hemlock and belladonna for Bellatrix Lestrange in the “Harry Potter” films, a chocolate chilli-scented fragrance for the Red Queen character in “Alice in Wonderland,” and what Glasser describes as a mixture of “old, cracked soap with a ‘pissy’ note to it” for the role of Miss Havisham in 2012’s “Great Expectations.”“Helena couldn’t wait to get into rehearsals with that one,” said Glasser who is famed for having one of the best ‘noses’ in the business and prides herself on elevating an A-lister’s presence through her visceral scent blends.Born in the UK, Glasser spent her early formative years in India before returning to London. She worked for British fragrance house CPL Aromas for 20 years before creating the iconic Agent Provocateur fragrance in 2000, and in 2016, founded her own brand, The Perfumer’s Story by Azzi. Now, a bespoke fragrance from Glasser can cost up to £15,000 ($19,000), though she also offers a lower-priced collection of fragrances to enable people to discover their own fragrance DNA.Her roster of celebrity clients include actors Alicia Vikander, Noomi Rapace, Damian Lewis, Orlando Bloom, and Stephen Fry, as well as musicians Kylie Minogue and Adam Lambert. But it was Bonham Carter who introduced her “secret perfumer” to a curious Johnny Depp on the set of “Dark Shadows.” Depp promptly instructed Glasser to create a bespoke scent for his own character, a vampire called Barnabas, and they continued to work together. “Azzi possesses a certain sorcery in that she is capable of capturing the perfect essence of a character in scent,” he said of Glasser’s work.The perfumer believes that fragrance helps to truly understand the essence of a character. “We’ll meet up to talk about the role, the styling, who the director is, who the other actors are, the space, atmosphere, where they might be filming, whether it will be cold or hot… There are many elements at play. I’ll then go and start trialing and tweaking (the scent) until it’s absolutely perfect. I have never had anyone say, ‘no, it’s not quite right’,” said Glasser who can spend anything from a week to three months to create a custom-made scent.The result is not always positively fragrant, as with Jude Law’s depiction of an aging, ulcerated Henry VIII in the upcoming movie Firebrand.“I worked with Jude on “The Young Pope.” He came to the studio and told me, ‘I want to smell exactly like Henry.’ I told him, you know it’s going to smell repulsive, right?”The result was a heady brew of smells evoking gout, bad breath and excrement.“It was interesting because the other actors were affected by his presence, this power and manipulative stinkiness, as in real life. Whereas Henry could just (mask his own scent by) sniffing a handkerchief that smelt of rose.”Brad Pitt is on her wish list of collaborators, alongside Julia Roberts and Leonardo DiCaprio, although she has made headway with the latter, she revealed.“I met him at (a London restaurant) recently and he gave me his number,” says Glasser, who will soon be working with Austin Butler following his visit to her studio in north London alongside his model girlfriend Kaia Gerber.But whether she’s mixing a tailored fragrance for an exclusive venue, such as London’s Chiltern Firehouse, or an affluent individual — as she has done for Cindy Crawford (a 50th birthday present from her husband Rande Gerber), and David Linley, son of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones — Glasser approaches each scent as an entirely new landscape.“David called it a fun therapy session,” she laughs. “But it is learning about the person, or history, the character, style and so on,” said Glasser who called fragrance “the love of my life.”But it’s Hollywood’s A-listers who seem to benefit the most from a one-of-a-kind aroma.“As actors know, fragrance can transform you and take you on a journey. It opens up passages and doors in the brain, working through the olfactory system to bring out emotions,” noted Glasser. “It can make you feel more confident, powerful, desirable and assertive, and affect how others react to you. Essentially, scent tells a story.”"

        "text": "The stars of the new “Wicked” movie appear to be gearing up for an epic “method dressing” press tour, having opted for color-coded looks on the Oscars red carpet Sunday night in Los Angeles.Cynthia Erivo wore a bewitching emerald-green custom leather Louis Vuitton gown with structured ruffle sleeves and train, as a nod to her, well, “wicked” character Elphaba. Ariana Grande, her co-star in the forthcoming adaptation of the Broadway hit, meanwhile wore a voluminous bubblegum-pink gown by Giambattista Valli — perfect for the “good” witch Glinda.Speaking to red carpet mainstay Laverne Cox during E!’s pre-Oscars show, Erivo said the dress was all about the leather’s “witchy texture.” Later in the evening, the pair’s co-star Michelle Yeoh (who plays Madame Morrible, the headmistress at the school where Elphaba and Galinda meet) called Grande “a total princess, my princess.”“Wicked” is a re-telling of “The Wizard of Oz” based on Gregory Maguire’s 1995 book “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.” It follows the lives of two friends before and after the unexpected arrival of Dorothy Gale.The much-loved Tony-award-winning Broadway musical adaptation, on which the Jon M. Chu-directed movie is based, is told from the perspectives of Elphaba Thropp, who later becomes the Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda Upland, who becomes Glinda the Good. Over the course of the story, the two clash over their opposing personalities, love interests and political views, but ultimately become friends.“Method dressing,” where actors incorporate elements of their movies or TV shows into their outfits, has become an increasingly crucial part of awards shows, press tours and even fashion shows. The cast of “Dune: Part Two” has gone all out in recent weeks, with Zendaya, Timothée Chalamet and Florence Pugh all channeling the movie through futuristic, sci-fi inspired outfits. The cast of “Barbie,” meanwhile, turned red carpets pink last year, with Margot Robbie leaving fans wondering which historically accurate Barbie outfit she would turn up from one premiere to the next.Erivo and Grande appear to be carrying the torch. Earlier this year, the duo wore custom football jerseys to the Super Bowl. Both jerseys featured the number 27, a nod to November 27, which is the US release date of the two-part movie’s first chapter.“There’s always that incredible pressure because it’s so beloved,” Grande told Oscars pre-show co-host Vanessa Hudgens on the red carpet. “I’m a die-hard purist fan. There’s so much to balance; satiating the fans while also bringing a new truth to these characters that we’ve loved for 20 years and finding new things within them and making it our own in certain ways.”Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, who played Elphaba and Glinda respectively on Broadway as part of the musical’s original cast, expressed their support for Erivo and Grande when their roles were first announced in 2021.“Congrats to two amazing women,” Menzel wrote on Instagram at the time. “May it change your lives for the better forever and ever as it has for us. So much love.”"

        "text": "Basketball legend Michael Jordan won six NBA championships during his prolific sporting career — and a set of the six sneakers he wore when clinching those titles has sold for a record-breaking $8 million at auction.Friday’s winning bid for “The Dynasty Collection” reached $8,032,800, setting a new global auction record for game-worn sneakers, according to auction house Sotheby’s.The set consisted of Air Jordan VI (1991), Air Jordan VII (1992), Air Jordan VIII (1993), Air Jordan XI (1996), Air Jordan XII (1997), and Air Jordan XIV (1998).“This set represents the most valuable and significant collection of Air Jordan sneakers ever brought to market,” the auction house said on its website ahead of the auction.Notably, only one of each pair was sold.Before the 1991 NBA Finals, Tim Halland, executive director of PR for the Chicago Bulls, requested that Jordan give him one of his game-worn Air Jordan trainers if the team were victorious. Jordan, having won, fulfilled this request, signing and inscribing the shoe before gifting it to Halland – and, due to superstition, continued this tradition for the other five championships, according to Sotheby’s, who obtained the sneakers from a Private American Collector that had obtained them from Halland.The auction lot included a set of signed limited photographs depicting a smiling Jordan wearing just one sneaker following the triumphant NBA Finals.The gap between Jordan’s first three consecutive championships and his last three was due to a brief exit he made from the game of basketball in pursuit of professional baseball in October 1993. Although, by March 1995, he had made a stylish return – leading the Chicago Bulls to the most successful regular season in NBA history with 72 wins.An exceptional player, Jordan earned the nickname “Air Jordan” because of his incredible leaping ability and acrobatic maneuvers.The Air Jordan line has been coveted by sneakerheads ever since the ex-Bulls star wore them in his rookie year – with a buoyant resale market for his range.These sneakers are not the first to have sold for a staggering sum.Last year, a a pair of Jordan’s iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s – the kind he wore to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship in 1988 – sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York.In October 2021, a pair of red and white Nike Air Ships sneakers, the type worn by Jordan during his fifth NBA game in his rookie season with the Bulls on November 1, 1984, sold for $1.47 million at auction."

        "title": "Remember when Katharine Hepburn wore pants and scandalized America?",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "In a man’s world, Katharine Hepburn often wore the pants. The Hollywood leading lady and trailblazer defiantly embraced menswear staples, amid incredible pressure not to, paving the way for comfort-loving, power-dressing women decades on.Who could forget the sleek velvet smoking jacket and pants she wore in “Woman of the Year”? Or that slouchy two-piece she wore while perched atop an armchair, with wrinkled socks, scuffed Oxfords and a devil-may-care attitude, in the pages of Life magazine?But following her own style rules wasn’t always easy for Hepburn, a woman who would be later be revered as one of the greatest screen legends of all time and admired for her gumption. Studio staff hid her slacks backstage to stop her wearing them (she reportedly chose to go pantless until they were returned to her). Media outlets published lengthy articles questioning the Hollywood women who chose to wear men’s clothes. “Trousers for women are incredible, ridiculous and absurd!” Movie Classic magazine quoted Hepburn’s fellow actress Constance Bennett saying of the trend in 1933. “I can’t imagine wearing such atrocities.”The American public was also unsure what to make of Hepburn strutting around in pants in the 1930s, before the practicalities of World War II would make them more commonplace among women. “Hepburn’s on- and offscreen choices left many critics and much of the public suspicious, even hostile,” wrote Hollywood historian William J. Mann in his 2006 biography of the star “Kate: The Woman Who Was Hepburn.”In 1934, Hepburn fled to Paris with her friend Susan Steell. As Mann tells it, critics at the time were ripping apart her latest film “Spitfire” and her Broadway performance in “The Lake.” People also felt alienated by her “eccentric approach to gender, sexuality, and stardom,” he wrote.Before that pivotal trip, Hepburn would dress in old clothes, wear no makeup and refuse to let publicists link her romantically with men (she lived with a woman, fueling rumors she was lesbian). She even spoke out about politics, supporting Upton Sinclair, a socialist Democratic nominee in the 1934 California governor’s race, and facing accusations of holding communist beliefs. “Then there were her movies — edgy and offbeat, glimpses of an alternative world where unmarried women held the upper hand,” continued Mann.Take the 1933 romantic drama “Christopher Strong,” in which Hepburn’s pants-wearing character, aviator Lady Cynthia Darrington, has an affair with a married man. The film’s message seemed to renounce the idea of marriage entirely, with the neglected wife of Darrington’s lover (played by actress Billie Burke) saying: “Marriage and children make almost any woman old-fashioned and intolerant.”“What’s fascinating,” Mann wrote of Hepburn, “is that this figure, reviled as subversive in so many ways, could be transformed — as the years passed — into a national heroine.” She would go on to win four Best Actress Oscars for “Morning Glory” in 1933, “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” in 1967, “The Lion in Winter” in 1968, and “On Golden Pond” in 1981, carefully crafting a persona along the way.She turned herself into “a symbol of true-blue, red-blooded Americana because she had to if she was to survive and prosper,” wrote Mann.Hepburn’s style was part of that story.One of her greatest allies in crafting a new public image was Gilbert Adrian, chief costume designer at MGM from 1924 to 1941, who put Hepburn in that iconic goddess gown in “The Philadelphia Story” that has since inspired similar looks for the likes of Jane Fonda, Halle Berry and Cate Blanchett.Adrian is also the man who — seeing how ahead of the times Hepburn was — backed her personal style and preference for pants by translating it onto the silver screen. A woman in menswear was still a rare occurrence, despite stars like Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich also blazing the way, according to fashion historian Kimberly Truhler.“It is not too much of an overstatement to say that ‘The Philadelphia Story’ is revolutionary in its costume design,” Truhler wrote on her fashion history blog GlamAmor in 2014. “It features not one, but two examples of menswear… three if you include her equestrian ensemble as well. All of these outfits essentially open the movie, too, which was unprecedented… (Hepburn’s) desire to wear pants, particularly in the opening scene of this film, was objected to by both producer Joseph Mankiewicz and Louis B. Mayer. But her arrangement with MGM allowed a tremendous amount of control, and she literally showed them who wore the pants in their relationship.”That velvet smoking jacket? That was also Adrian. Truhler said it would later influence the likes of Yves Saint Laurent, whose Fall-Winter 1966 collection introduced the iconic ladies’ tuxedo that he would continue including in all his collections until 2002.Hepburn’s pant-led outfits have remained in the annals of style, making her pairing of blue jeans or high-waisted slacks with button-down shirts a quintessential “American look.” And if the ubiquity of trousers today is anything to go by, her legacy stretches far beyond the silver screen."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Archaeologists have discovered the earliest dated cave paintings in South America in Argentine Patagonia, dating back 8,200 years.The 895 paintings were found by Argentine and Chilean archaeologists in the Huenul 1 cave, a 630 square meter (6,781 square foot) rock shelter located in the province of Neuquen, some 1,100 kilometers (684 miles) southwest of the capital Buenos Aires.“We were able to date four black peniform patterns that were drawn in charcoal. These proved to be the earliest direct dating of cave paintings in South America,” said Dr. Guadalupe Romero Villanueva, author of the research published in the Science Advances journal.The Argentinean archaeologist said the discovery indicates that the production of cave art began in the Huenul cave about 8,000 years ago and that the practice of painting the particular pattern seen in the cave was sustained for a period of at least 3,000 years.The discovery provides evidence of the artistic ability and cultural transmission of the hunter-gatherer societies which inhabited the region during the middle Holocene, a period roughly from 7,000 to 5,000 years ago, and reveals the socioecological resilience to climate, as well as serving as a means of communication between scattered populations.“We believe these images in particular were part of a resilient response of the mobile hunter-gatherer groups that occupied this cave and the desert environments of northern Patagonia to the climatic challenge of a period of extreme dryness that occurred during the middle Holocene,” said Romero Villanueva, a researcher at the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research of Argentina.Villanueva said there are other places in South America that could have older cave paintings, but which only have relative dating, like Argentina’s Cueva de las Manos, with cave paintings dating back 9,500 years."

        "text": "Sofía Vergara’s palatial estate in the star-studded Los Angeles neighborhood of Beverly Park evokes an old-world grandeur fit for royalty. But in curating the space, the actor wanted to ensure that guests would feel comfortable there.“I’m not afraid to spend money, but it has to be for something practical, not just things that are there to look good,” Vergara told Architectural Digest. “I didn’t want furniture that is so precious that people would be afraid to use and enjoy it.”Vergara, the “Modern Family” star who more recently played notorious crime boss Griselda Blanco in the eponymous Netflix series, is on the March cover of Architectural Digest — one of several celebrities who opened their doors to the magazine for its “Hollywood at Home” issue.“AD began in Los Angeles more than 100 years ago, and the city and its architecture continue to charm and influence the design world, even today,” the magazine’s global editorial director Amy Astley said in a statement. “For this year’s ‘Hollywood at Home’ issue, we went inside the private spaces of some of the most innovative industry talents.”Vergara’s home is brimming with historical charm and opulent details — Baroque armchairs in the living room, a Spanish tole chandelier in the cavernous family room and hand-embossed floral plaster detailing on the dining room ceiling. But achieving the look, and allowing those features to stand out, required a significant transformation: “There were arches on top of arches, all with columns. It felt like a castle in Transylvania,” Vergara said, recalling how the property looked when she first bought it.Hoping to modernize her new home, Vergara brought in designer Ohara Davies-Gaetano, who also spoke to Architectural Digest for the feature. “Sofía articulated a clear vision for the project,” the designer is quoted saying. “She wanted a home that felt ethereal yet grounded, something fresh, clean, and bright, with lots of great antiques that added patina and warmth to the architecture.The high-profile renovations have not been without controversy, however. Last November, contractors who worked on the property sued Vergara for $1.7 million, alleging that she breached contract and mistreated employees, court records show. Vergara’s attorneys disputed the accusations, and filed a counterclaim last month, alleging the contractor sued erroneously after Vergara complained of “negligent and inadequate work.”Though there are teal notes in Vergara’s soft furnishings, threads of color woven through rugs, and lustrous gold and bronze accents found on fixtures and furniture, the home’s palette is largely calming and neutral.“I don’t like crazy jolts of color,” Vergara told the magazine of her preferred color scheme. (Pastels were also a no-no, she explained, “because they remind me of ‘The Golden Girls.’”)The interiors are accented, however, with plants and greenery in many rooms — a lively design choice that both matches and accentuates the property’s sizable grounds, which include a stucco-roof pool house and an alleé of olive trees.The estate’s outdoor spaces — or rather, their potential — was a major draw for Vergara: “I loved that you could see the landscape from every room, even though there wasn’t much of a garden to look at yet. I knew what I would do to make it my own,” she said.Landscape designer and antiques dealer Stephen Block brought her vision to life, adding earthen pots, antique fountains and tropical elements that nod to the actor’s Colombian roots.The result is a lavish property ready for entertaining. “My friends from Colombia find any excuse to visit,” Vergara told AD. “There’s just something about this place that makes guests want to stay. It’s special. I still wake up every day thinking, I can’t believe this is my life.”"

        "text": "Besting 111 of her fellow titleholders from across the globe, Krystyna Pyszková of the Czech Republic was crowned Miss World 2024 on Saturday in Mumbai, India, where the international pageant was held this year.Across a series of events during the pageant’s preliminary competition, including fitness, beauty, talent and public speaking, several contestants won “fast track” places in the top 40, a cohort announced at the start of the show.From there, the field was quickly slashed to top 12 and then top eight, at which point the contestants participated in the classic Q&A round, addressing topics discussed at the most recent G20 Summit. Asked to shed light on an issue impacting women’s health care specifically, Pyszková, a 23-year-old law student and model, spoke about removing the stigma and shame surrounding menstruation, saying that “being a woman is a gift” and that periods should not be a taboo subject.After one final cut, four contestants were left to “pitch their purpose” (or philanthropic platform) to a trio of business moguls from “Shark Tank India.” Each of these four finalists represented a different region of the world: Africa, the Americas and Caribbean, Asia and Oceania and Europe.Pyszková’s victory came over these three runners-up — Yasmina Zeytoun of Lebanon, Aché Abrahams of Trinidad and Tobago and Lesego Chombo of Botswana. (These women, along with Jessica Gagen of England, are considered the pageant’s “continental winners.”)Miss World is widely viewed as the oldest international beauty pageant, first founded in the United Kingdom in 1951 as a “bikini contest.” Perhaps its two best-known winners are both from India: the actors Aishwarya Rai Bachchan (Miss World 1994) and Priyanka Chopra Jonas (Miss World 2000). Chopra Jonas appeared at the pageant in a video message, paying tribute to both Miss World owner Julia Morley and Nita Ambani, winner of the pageant’s Humanitarian Award.Pyszková replaces the outgoing Miss World, Karolina Bielawska, of Poland, whose reign dates back to March 2022. (Due to scheduling issues, no Miss World pageant was held in 2023.)"

        "title": "Inside ‘Biba:’ The iconic London store where Anna Wintour was a shop girl",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "“My God, it’s dull,” said interior designer Steven Thomas of the British retail landscape in 2024. As the creative force behind the look of the wildly popular 1970s London fashion store Big Biba, Thomas knows a thing or two about engineering excitement.Big Biba — a daring, 20,000 square foot destination by fashion illustrator Barbara Hulanicki and her former marketing executive husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon — was conceived with a level of detail usually reserved for high-end concept stores. Opened in September 1973, it was the fourth and final outpost of the-then iconic brand. The seven-floor Art Deco emporium on London’s fashionable Kensington High Street featured a soup stand inspired by Andy Warhol, a roof garden featuring real flamingos and penguins, and a much-lauded celebrity hotspot the “Rainbow Room”.“Because the Rainbow Room looked the way it did, it didn’t take long for the glitterati to latch on; it was very much a place to be seen dining,” recalled Thomas in an interview with CNN. Originally designed by architect Marcel Hennequet in 1933 and named after its multi-colored ceiling (the dining room was otherwise all white tablecloths and fake plants), it “became a venue of choice,” he suggested. “David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Bryan Ferry all dropped in.”“Fitz employed the son of a friend who had an extraordinary knack of picking people up, like Ian Dury and the Blockheads,” continued Thomas, recalling the unofficial booker. “He got the New York Dolls to play when they came over, another coup. They did a vandalizing tour of the first floor, shoplifting all the women’s clothes.”These stories and more are all explored in “Welcome to Big Biba,” Thomas’s gold-fronted monograph of the venture republished this month to celebrate the brand’s 60th anniversary. “This book is a testament to creative freedom,” writes the now 87-year-old Hulanicki in the foreword, reflecting on her legacy. “You can do it all as long as you learn to wear a suit. Of course, your secret will be that the suit is lined in gold lamé.”The Biba story began in May 1964 when Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon began running “Biba’s Postal Boutique,” a mail-order store selling limited runs of stock. Singer Annie Lennox described the venture as having led “the way for those of us living in provincial places where we felt we were dying of drabness.”Inspired by decadent styles from bygone times — albeit with drastically shortened hemlines — in earthy or muted colors such as olive, rust and “bruised purple,” Biba’s wares certainly struck a chord with young female shoppers, and the brand rode the wave of what Thomas described as “the first burst of teenage energy and finance availability.”“Biba made fashion democratic,” explained Martin Pel, author of “The Biba Years 1963-1975” and curator of a new exhibition at London’s Fashion & Textile Museum, in an email. “This expression is often overused of designers in the 1960s, particularly Mary Quant. Quant’s clothes whilst youthful, were expensive. Biba was inexpensive, well designed, good quality, and up-to-the-minute.”By September 1964, Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon had opened their first brick and mortar store in a former drugstore, twice moving the business into bigger premises throughout the 60s. In 1966 the brand’s second shop on Kensington Church Street — where Vogue editor Anna Wintour famously did a stint as a Saturday girl — was described by Vanity Fair magazine as “the most exotic shop in London.” and in the early 1970s, a boutique launched in New York’s Bergdorf Goodman department store.Interior designer Thomas had already designed Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon’s home and the third Biba store in 1968 before being approached about the landmark seven-level store. “Fitz offered me two floors (of Big Biba) but I wanted it all,” he recalled of his initial involvement. “A moment of complete lunacy, considering Tim (Whitmore, his creative partner) and I were ex-painting students working out of my bedroom. It was an extraordinary act of bravery on their part, giving us the contract, it wouldn’t happen today.”Stocking Big Biba’s seven floors was equal parts intimidating and invigorating said Thomas, explaining that he and Whitmore worked closely with Hulanicki throughout. “Biba was always a reflection of Barbara’s life,” he noted, “so because Barbara had a kid, of course we had a kid’s floor,” with décor inspired by Disney World, a carousel ride and miniature cottage kids café with toadstool seating. On Saturdays, an actor would visit and read stories and a crèche — a revolutionary concept in fashion retail now, let alone 50 years ago — allowed parents freedom to explore the other floors.A maternity section and a space for 11-13 year old’s were similarly modern for the time, likewise the introduction of communal changing rooms — although true to the spirit of the times, many clients reportedly changed in the middle of the store itself.Elsewhere menswear took over the third floor, complete with a “mistress” section for purchasing more sensual items with discretion. Biba-branded household items were upstairs. While each floor took on its own theme (maternity for example was fitted with comedic outsized furniture, inspired by Ken Russell’s 1971 musical comedy “The Boyfriend”), much of the store was furnished in Biba’s distinctive black and gold colorway, with mirrored fixtures, ostrich feathers and leopard print features.While Wintour’s shopgirl life was short-lived, Big Biba’s staff were a vital component of the experience remembered Thomas. “They loved working there, it was their club,” he said. “And if a (customer) bought a Biba poster and stuck it on her wall, she felt part of the club. It was the theater of retail really.”It was an unmitigated success. When the store opened its legendary roof gardens in 1974, they were ushered in by a party described in the British press as “like walking into a film set of rather jolly moral depravity.” Shoppers from all over the country, and even internationally, convened at the store to buy into the zeitgeist. According to Hulanicki, during its two-year run, Big Biba was the number two tourist attraction in the British capital after the Tower of London, with Buckingham Palace being number three.But Biba’s success was short-lived. In 1969, the independent company sold a majority of its shares to another British fashion retailer Dorothy Perkins which, in August 1973 (a month before Big Biba opened), was then bought by a property development company called British Land. The high cost of keeping the store open and the faltering British economy of the mid-70s meant the new owners closed the store’s third and fourth floors in March 1975, and the rest of the store followed that September against the backdrop of a nationwide property slump.Six decades on however, Biba’s legacy outlasts its footprint on the high street. Its low-cost yet well-made clothing is still coveted today, with heirloom designs sometimes retailing for hundreds of dollars. As Pel noted, “today Biba clothes stand as a lesson to both consumers and retailers that inexpensive fashion does not have to be disposable.”"

        "title": "Ukrainian-born Miss Japan relinquishes crown following alleged affair",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "The Ukrainian-born beauty queen who sparked a debate on cultural identity by being named Miss Japan has relinquished her title just two weeks after being crowned.Karolina Shiino, the first person of predominantly European heritage ever to win the Miss Nippon contest (which takes its title from the country’s Japanese name), announced her decision to step down on Monday following local newspaper allegations of an affair with a married man.In a statement posted to Instagram, the 26-year-old model apologized to the man’s family and those involved. She also announced that she was parting ways with her talent agency, writing: “I am truly sorry for causing a lot of trouble for many people and betraying those who have supported me.”Organizers of the event meanwhile released a statement saying that Shiino had “requested to withdraw from the contest due to personal reasons.” Kaoru Wada, chair of the Miss Nippon Association, added that the 2024 title will remain “vacant.”Despite being a naturalized citizen who speaks fluent Japanese and has lived in the country since she was 5 years old, Shiino’s pageant victory proved controversial, with some critics questioning whether someone without Japanese ethnicity could encapsulate the country’s beauty ideals.“I wanted to be recognized as a Japanese person,” Shiino told CNN in Tokyo following her win last month. “I kept being told that I’m not Japanese, but I am absolutely Japanese, so I entered Miss Japan genuinely believing in myself. I was really happy to be recognized like this.”The decision to pick a winner with European heritage prompted debate on social media, raising questions about what it means to be Japanese and the impact of Western beauty ideals in Asia.“If the Miss Nippon contest is based on the concept of beauty, I personally wish that it would be based on standards of Japanese beauty,” historian Hiroe Yamashita wrote on X following Shiino’s victory. “But With Karolina Shiino’s appearance, an (ethnically) Japanese girl has no chance of winning under the modern values of beauty.”Recounting to CNN the difficulties she faced growing up in Japan — an ethnically homogeneous country with comparatively low levels of immigration — Shiino called for a broader definition of who should be considered Japanese. “After all, we live in an era of diversity — where diversity is needed,” she said at the time."

        "title": "Inspired by a dream, this photograph became a symbol for a transformative protest movement",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Nine years ago, Sethembile Msezane stepped on top of a plinth, wearing a black body suit and stiletto heels, her arms adorned with wings she fashioned out of wood, velvet, and hair. Behind her, a statue of a man can be seen being lifted in the air. “Chapungu — The Day Rhodes Fell” has since become an iconic photograph, capturing the spirit of the #RhodesMustFall movement which led to the removal of 19th century colonist Cecil Rhodes’ statue at the University of Cape Town.Msezane was a studying for a Master’s degree in Fine Arts at the university during the protests, which saw students call for the Briton’s statue to come down, citing his legacy as being tainted with racism.“There is no way I could have conceptualized that moment and the way things unfolded on that day,” said Msezane, speaking to CNN from Cape Town. Her performance, and the resulting image — which has come to serve as a symbol for the historic day — was born from a recurring dream that haunted her around the time the protest movement began.The dreams centred around “Chapungu,” a sacred Zimbabwean bateleur eagle who Msezane embodied atop the plinth with her wings.Eight of the birds — which hold great spiritual value for the people of Zimbabwe — were immortalised in green-gray soapstone in the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe. As the site fell into disrepair, six were subsequently looted, and in the 1800s, one statue of Chapungu was given to Cecil Rhodes. While several have now been returned, to this day, it remains at Rhodes’ former home at the Groote Shuur estate in Cape Town, Msezane explained.“There have been political calls for her to return home, but for some reason, these calls have been denied,” she said. “There is a mythological belief that until she is returned home, there will be social unrest in Zimbabwe.”Msezane says that Chapungu, who is a totem of people’s hopes and aspirations in Zimbabwean society, was in collaboration with her consciousness on the day Rhodes fell. “She used my body as a vessel, and I accepted the call.”Even after the sculpture of Rhodes had fallen, Msezane stayed atop her plinth for another 20-30 minutes. “It was important for (Chapungu) to be present so that she could be seen, so that we can begin to see ourselves in her — and not in our history of subjugation and dispossession. That we too have histories of abundance and ancestral knowledge.”The image is currently on display in London as part of the South London Gallery and V&A Parasol Foundation’s exhibition “Acts of Resistance: Photography, Feminisms and the Art of Protest” which takes a journey through female-led resistance around the world, from the perils of illegal abortion in Chile, Poland, and the United States, to women-led protests in Iran and Bangladesh.Creating the work took its toll. The Chapungu piece — which involved Msezane standing on the plinth in high heels on a hot day for nearly four hours — was “pretty strenuous,” she said. She would hold the wings strapped to her arms aloft for two minutes before having to rest for 10, then start again.She was also afraid at the beginning. “When you make a work like that, you’re quite vulnerable,” she explained.“I was scared because what if the police come and take me away, while this very important historical occasion is happening? What would happen to me, having been taken away wearing a leotard and some stilettos? Would I be pushed over? Could I potentially hurt myself or die?”Afterwards, she was shaking. Her limbs were tired, her feet painful and her vision blurred. “All I wanted were my clothes,” she says, of stepping off the plinth. “I just wanted to go home and take a bath.”When the Chapungu work garnered so much international attention, Msezane continued on with her life and didn’t think much about it.“I was still within the tension of what was happening,” she said, referencing the Rhodes movement and what would lead to the Fees Must Fall campaign. While her work was receiving acclaim, she was being targeted for her involvement with the movement.“My work was being cited everywhere and it meant very little to me to be honest, when that was the reality I was living… the system still finds ways to oppress you, even though a work like that can give you a voice.”Sometimes, she fears that the meaning of the piece is lost — with the focus being on Rhodes and not the symbol of Chapungu, who has “become a beacon of hope for many.”For Msezane, the work has inspired her to think about how else we can help women around the world. She no longer performs “endurance works” like Chapungu, citing how taxing, dangerous, and emotional such they can be. Instead, she uses her art as a tool for change in other ways — such as by donating profits from the sales of her work to fund charitable endeavors (she has previously supported the Panzi Hospital in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which provides health care for over 80,000 women and girls who are survivors of conflict-related sexual violence).From a young age, Msezane was a creative at heart — expressing herself through poems, drawings, and dress, but she did not expect to become an artist.“I didn’t think that being an artist would be viable for me,” she explained. With encouragement from her aunt, she set off to study fine arts at the University of Cape Town — an experience which she describes as “very frustrating,” due to the curriculum’s Eurocentrism.“I kept fumbling over concepts of Africans not being producers of their own work but being faceless and nameless.”While observing Cape Town’s landscape and architecture, Msezane became inspired to think about what the city had to say about black women’s histories. “I found it to be quite barren of our stories,” Msezane told CNN.This observation marked the start of her Public Holidays performance art series, when Msezane would use the day off from her job as an arts administrator to stage performances in the city.“It became a task for me to re-insert some of the histories I was thinking about on political public holidays, in relation to colonial, male, European statues,” she said. She performed as Lady Liberty on Freedom Day, Rosie the Riveter on Worker’s Day. Not long after, Msezane left her day job and started practicing full-time as an artist. “It’s kind of how life panned out… it was a calling.”Now, suspended from a ceiling in a south London gallery, Msezane’s image greets visitors and commands their immediate attention. “I want for them to walk in with a sense of wonder and to let that wonder take over their senses,” she said. “When they view the image, let them go where they need to.”"

        "title": "Two skyscrapers joined by daring cantilevered ‘skybridge’ to soar over New York",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A pair of skyscrapers connected by a cantilevered “skybridge” and a rooftop infinity pool is set to join the New York City skyline, as developers unveiled a proposal for a new megaproject just south of the United Nations headquarters on Monday.Designed by architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), the 615-foot-tall towers will contain two hotels, while a soaring lobby across the top will house restaurants, bars, an art gallery a glass-floored (and glass-ceilinged) viewing platform and — should a license be granted — a subterranean casino.Along with two new residential towers, the skyscrapers will flank the newly unveiled Freedom Plaza development, a three-block-long public park with retail spaces and a new “Museum of Freedom and Democracy.”The Midtown Manhattan site, which overlooks the East River, is currently occupied by a large-scale art installation “Field of Light,” by British Artist Bruce Munro, that was commissioned by the charitable arm of Soloviev Group, the property developer behind the plan. But the 6.7-acre patch of prime real estate, roughly the size of Madison Square Park, has sat largely unused since the 2000s.Bjarke Ingels, the Danish founder and creative director of BIG, said his firm’s design looks to extend the greenery that architects Le Corbusier, Wallace Harrison and Oscar Niemeyer created at the neighboring UN building.“We continue to build on these architectural principles by uniting three city blocks to form a public green space reaching from 1st Avenue to the East River overlook, creating a green connection all the way to the water’s edge,” said Ingels in a press statement.The two hotel towers are set to host the city’s first five-star Banyan Tree property, as well as a hotel run by casino operator Mohegan. A 150,000-gallon infinity pool will be built on the roof of the connecting skybridge, with BIG describing it as “one of the largest rooftop pools in North America.”The 50- and 60-story residential towers, meanwhile, nod to the modernist New York City buildings of the 1950s and 1960s thanks to their striped glass and aluminum facades. Measuring 550 and 650 feet tall, the two high-rises will be connected by a podium housing a food market and retail space.The development is one of several projects competing for three casino gaming licenses recently approved for downstate New York by the state’s gaming commission. But plans have faced local opposition, with some residents and officials voicing concern about the development. Hoping to entice authorities to grant the license, the Soloviev Group has said it would designate 513, or nearly 40% of the development’s 1,325 apartments as affordable housing should the license come through.“The revenue generated by the project’s entertainment and hospitality component will allow Freedom Plaza to deliver the affordable housing program and expansive publicly accessible green space, with many more details yet to be announced,” said Ray Pineault, CEO and President of Mohegan in a statement last year.Americans are currently living through the toughest housing market in a generation, and New York has been one of the hardest hit locations, with rental vacancy rates down to a multi-decade low of 1.4%, according to the 2023 NYC Housing and Vacancy Survey.Soloviev Group has also promised that an unspecified percentage of the gaming profits, starting with a minimum $5 million donation, will go to an independently run non-profit community fund.Elsewhere on the site, BIG has designed a new “Museum of Freedom and Democracy” that “celebrates the origin and evolution of one of the most impactful inventions of mankind and our continuous struggle to build, maintain and protect the institutions that uphold it,” said Ingels.The Möbius strip-shaped building, overlooking the river, winds on top of itself creating outdoor walking paths. BIG described the design as an homage to the amphitheaters built by the Ancient Greeks, the creators of modern democracy.Unaffiliated with Long Island University’s Museum of Democracy, the new institution will contain pieces of the Berlin Wall and works from the Soloviev Group’s art collection.“Our plan is to develop this site in a way that delivers benefits for the local neighborhood and the city as a whole, worthy of its skyline and waterfront location, and befitting New York City’s key role as a leader in the global cultural economy,” said Michael Hershman, CEO of the Soloviev Group, in a press release.Groundbreaking and completion dates are yet to be announced as the developers await a decision on the project’s casino license but will likely be finished in five to seven years once building works commences.Should the license not be granted, the project will continue, likely based on a previous design approved in 2008, said the developer."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Google is set to open its New York headquarters in a repurposed 1930s railway terminus near Hudson Square on Monday — and the tech giant says the project was designed with nature in mind.The 12-story St. John’s Terminal building, located at the nexus of Hudson River Park, the West Village, SoHo and Tribeca, is being billed as a “workplace designed for teams,” but it’s also providing a new home for local flora and fauna.With 1.5 acres of street-level vegetation, rail bed gardens and terraces that are 95% made up of plants native to New York State, the habitat created by the project has attracted more than 40 bird species, “including birds fueling up for a trans-Atlantic migratory flight,” wrote Google’s president for Americas and Global Business, Sean Downey, in an open letter on Wednesday.“It’s actually re-knitting the ecosystem, from the insects to the birds,” said Rick Cook, a founding partner at CookFox Architects, one of the design firms behind the project, in an introductory video published by Google.Once at the end of the railway now forming New York’s High Line, St. John’s Terminal served as a freight facility and office space. The renovation retained the original rail beds, turning them into planters that hang above the building’s main entrance, and incorporated wood reclaimed from the Coney Island boardwalk after Hurricane Sandy. Google said that the decision to repurpose an old building, rather than constructing its new headquarters from scratch, saved 78,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions (equivalent to taking around 17,000 cars off the road for a year). The tech giant also claimed it had prevented 77% of its construction waste from ending up in landfills.The complex is one of several Google offices built in renovated structures, including a converted flour mill in Dublin, a former aircraft hangar in LA’s Playa Vista neighborhood and Pier 57, once a New York City shipping terminal. The tech firm also owns the nearby Chelsea Market, purchased for $2.4 billion in 2018 after it had been converted into a retail and office development.Google began leasing the St. John’s Terminal site in 2019, and bought it outright in 2022 for $2.1 billion. The building serves as a headquarters for Google’s Global Business Organization, which includes the firm’s sales and partnership teams.The renovation project was commissioned in 2018, before the Covid-19 pandemic, but its final design was later adapted to offer more flexible work arrangements. Google, like many large corporations in America, is trying to entice workers back to the office, and the new campus — whose interiors were designed by international architecture studio Gensler — is being heralded by the tech giant as a place to connect and innovate.“If you’re going to make that commute in, it should be because you can work with people that have passion, that have ideas, that you can sit next to and come up with something that you couldn’t do just on your own, and that’s really the vision of this space,” said Downey in a video introducing the new campus.The building can accommodate around 3,000 workers and is organized into 60 “neighborhoods” for teams of around 20 to 50 people. There are no assigned desks but instead workers can use flexible seating areas or shared spaces including lounges, cafes, terraces and micro-kitchens.“Creativity wants to move around, so we’ve created as much common spaces as we have neighborhood space, if not more, for people to meet, to work, to collaborate,” said Jennifer Kelly, a vice president of workplace experience, in the same video. “Some feel like a library, some feel like a coffee shop, so people have options to use spaces that they feel most comfortable in.”There are currently more than 14,000 Google employees in New York, up from 7,000 when the company announced the St. John’s Terminal project in 2018, despite sweeping layoffs across several divisions earlier in this year. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, also slashed around 12,000 jobs — then around 6% of its workforce — at the beginning of 2023."

        "title": "Inside the many, many glamorous homes owned by fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Fashion writer Patrick Mauriès first met Karl Lagerfeld in 1981, after he quoted the fashion designer in a short book he had written about contemporary fashion and culture. Although Lagerfeld had by that time already designed for the luxury houses Chloé and Fendi, he was not the iconic figure he would become later in life, particularly after he joined Chanel as creative director in 1983 — a role he held until his death in 2019. As his star rose, he and Mauriès remained good friends, with the writer enjoying rare glimpses into parts of Lagerfeld’s private life and way of living at his many lavish properties over the years.“Everything was absolute luxury. Even when you went for a small lunch with him, the napkins were embroidered,” said Mauriès, recalling how Lagerfeld was one of the first people he knew to use Diptyque candles at home — but never just one of them, of course. “There would be 20 candles in the staircase leading to the dining room, and so it was a very high luxury feeling.”The full extent of this tirelessly-curated “high luxury” is revealed in the new book “Karl Lagerfeld: A Life in Houses,” with an introduction by Mauriès and accompanying texts about each home by Marie Kalt, a former editor of “Architectural Digest France.” Featuring rarely-seen images of 13 of Lagerfeld’s properties in Europe — spanning Paris, Monte Carlo, Rome, Hamburg and more — the book reveals a lesser-known side to the designer, and provides insight into his sense of style when it came to interior design.Each property was decorated in a different, distinctive way. Lagerfeld’s early Parisian home on the Rue de l’Université — an apartment on the second floor of an 18th-century mansion he shared with his mother in the 1960s and ‘70s — was filled with Art Deco furniture and homeware, from the sofas to the cocktail glasses.In 1977, Lagerfeld moved into the 18th-century Hôtel Pozzo di Borgo in Paris, with his residence — or residences, rather, as he moved at various points between different parts of the building — evoking the grandeur and spirit of the Age of Enlightenment with ornate tapestries and gilded detailing in many of the rooms. “He was playing all the time with the spirit of the place,” said Mauriès, adding that some of the only common threads in Lagerfeld’s interiors were nods to his German heritage.In the Monte Carlo residence he bought in the 1980s, Lagerfeld was drawn to the Memphis Group design school, a collective of designers founded by Italian architect Ettore Sottsass that made use of bold colors, geometry and playfulness. Lagerfeld’s residence in his German hometown of Hamburg, named Vila Jako after his long-term companion Jacques de Bascher, was bought in the early 1990s; Lagerfeld then filled its interiors with objects including vases from the Swedish Grace design movement, which was a bridge between Art Nouveau and Modernism.“It was always changing from one atmosphere to another, from antiquarian interiors to ultra-modern ones,” said Mauriès of Lagerfeld’s design aesthetic, having visited many of his properties over the years, particularly those in Paris. “He’s a singularity in that there is no unity in his type of decoration.”And, as Mauriès explained, while Lagerfeld derived inspiration from the past, a sense of change and forward momentum was an inherent part of his creative practice. “What was essential for him was to live in the present tense or the present times. Once he thought something was a bit outdated or not of the moment, he discarded it and put it in storage,” said Mauriès. “He was always moving, he couldn’t imagine himself stuck in a period or style.”In fact, Mauriès compared Lagerfeld’s approach to decorating each home as almost like designing a theater set, as the designer became completely immersed in the details and minutiae of one space at a time. “And then when it was done, he lost a bit of interest, and went on to create another one.”In a way, this process of reinvention was also an embodiment of Lagerfeld’s fashion design, from one season to the next, and the evolution of his own image and sense of personal style.As Lagerfeld became more of a public figure in the 1990s and 2000s, he increasingly sought homes that could act as retreats, said Mauriès. “It was something he needed to refocus and recreate himself… He needed these lairs in which to work.”In keeping with Lagerfeld’s constant need for change, there is little left of the homes and interiors featured in the book. The designer sold many of the properties while he was still alive, and dispersed or bequeathed items he had collected in various ways, including by auction. A sale at Sotheby’s in 1991 saw Lagerfeld’s collection of 133 Memphis Group items go under the hammer, with a dressing table and matching stool designed by American postmodernist architect Michael Graves reaching 150,000 francs (then about $26,000, or around $59,000 in today’s money). A posthumous auction of objects from Lagerfeld’s estate, including his sketches, clothing and furniture, meanwhile, consisted of 1,200 lots assembled from five of his residences in and around Paris and Monaco.Only one place that Lagerfeld called home has been preserved as it was when he lived there: the 7L bookshop and photo studio that he set up in 1999 in the Rue de Lille in Paris. The property was acquired by Chanel in 2001, and today acts as an homage to the designer. In his lifetime, Lagerfeld was known for his love of books, amassing huge collections and creating libraries in his residences. Today, the bookshop hosts regular public events and offers a library curation service for bibliophiles looking to build their own reading rooms at home.“Everything disappeared — it’s a strange destiny,” said Mauriès. “But that follows his way of living. He was not interested in keeping memories or having these really private and intimate places preserved.”Indeed, Lagerfeld’s own words quoted in the book outline this philosophy: “The most beautiful house is always the next one.”"

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Shigeichi Negishi, the entrepreneur who invented the world’s first karaoke machine, has died aged 100.Negishi, whose 1967 “Sparko Box” prototype is among several devices credited with ushering in Japan’s karaoke craze, died from natural causes in January. His death, which was made public last week, was confirmed to CNN by Shiro Kataoka, managing director of the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association.Born in 1923, Negishi founded and ran a company that assembled car stereos for automobile manufacturers in northern Tokyo. A regular listener to a singalong radio show broadcast in Japan at the time, he hooked a spare tape deck up to a microphone and mixing circuit so he could hear himself singing over music.“When I asked the factory engineer, he said, ‘It’s easy,’” Negishi recalled in an account published by the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association, an industry body for Japan’s karaoke operators. “So, I attached a microphone input terminal to the car stereo and created something like the prototype of a jukebox.”According to author Matt Alt, whose interview with Negishi features in his 2020 book “Pure Invention: How Japan Made the Modern World,” the inventor first tested the device with an instrumental tape of Yoshio Kodama’s 1930s song “Mujo no Yume.”“It works!” he told Alt, recalling the moment he heard his voice coming through the speakers alongside the music. “That’s all I was thinking. Most of all, it was fun. I knew right away I’d discovered something new.”Marketing the device as a Sparko Box, he sold them alongside lyrics cards and reportedly produced and installed around 8,000 around Japan, mainly at bars and restaurants. By the time Negishi stopped selling the products in the 1970s, several rival machines had been invented and taken to market.“At that time, it was not customary to sing in stores, so it may have been inevitable that (the Sparko Boxes were) sold as background music,” reads Negishi’s entry on the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association’s website. “Now that I think about it, it’s a bit of a shame.”The industry body does not credit a single person with inventing karaoke (which literally translates as “empty orchestra”), but instead recognizes several people who independently created machines in the late 1960s and early 1970s.Perhaps the best known of them is musician and businessman Daisuke Inoue, whose 8 Juke machine — invented in 1971, and also based on a car stereo — is credited with helping commercialize karaoke.But Inoue, like Negishi, did not patent his invention, and electronics manufacturers soon began producing and marketing their own versions. By the 1980s, “karaoke boxes” (known elsewhere as KTVs) had swept Japan, with private rooms overtaking bars and restaurants as the main venues for Japan’s amateur singers.Subsequent developments, including the introduction of video karaoke and networked karaoke systems, helped the phenomenon spread across Asia and the world in the following decades.Today, Japan is home to more than 8,000 dedicated karaoke box venues, while 131,500 bars are equipped with karaoke machines — a market worth a combined 387.9 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in 2022, according to estimates from the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association."

        "text": "Spanish police said they have shut down an alleged forgery ring selling fake Banksy artworks across the US and Europe for up to 1,500 euros ($1,642) a piece.Investigators seized nine artworks during a raid of an apartment in the city of Zaragoza, northern Spain, according to Catalan police. A group operating from the property has been linked to some 25 sales — made through online platforms, auction rooms and antique shops — involving works attributed to Banksy, police said in a statement on Thursday.Agents from the Catalan police force’s Central Historical Heritage Unit have identified victims in Spain, Germany, Switzerland, United States and United Kingdom who bought pieces from the workshop believing them to be from the anonymous street artist’s “Dismaland” project.The seized works were created on cardboard with spray paint using stencils, while ink seals and stickers were added to make them appear authentic.Police said they have charged four people with fraud and intellectual property offenses. Two of the alleged fraudsters are suffering from “financial problems” and made copies of Banksy’s work before selling them at “reasonable prices no higher than 80 euros ($87),” the police statement said. The “main suspect” meanwhile had knowledge of the art world and is accused of passing the works off as genuine using forged certificates.Investigators said Banksy’s Pest Control organization, the only body able to officially authenticate the artist’s work, has confirmed that pieces linked to the Zaragoza workshop are fake, as are the accompanying certificates. Police became suspicious after noticing that many similar works had become available on the market, the statement added.Banksy started out as a graffiti artist in the British city of Bristol in the 1990s and has since become one of the art world’s most sought-after names thanks to his subversive statements and dark humor. His 2015 “Dismaland” installation — located in a British seaside town — was a twisted spin on Disneyland billed as a “bemusement park,” and featured a decrepit fairytale castle, a game where visitors navigated packed migrant boats through murky water and a high-interest loan store for kids seeking advances on their allowances.Though the market value of his work has soared in recent years (his famous self-shredding work “Love is in the Bin” sold for a record $25.4 million at a Sotheby’s auction in 2021), Banksy continues to produce works in public spaces that make their preservation near impossible — and even invite theft or defacement.The investigation remains open, and police said they are not ruling out more victims and further arrests."

        "title": "Photographer steps inside Vietnam’s shadowy ‘click farms’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Jack Latham was on a mission to photograph farms in Vietnam — not the country’s sprawling plantations or rice terraces but its “click farms.”Last year, the British photographer spent a month in the capital Hanoi documenting some of the shadowy enterprises that help clients artificially boost online traffic and social media engagement in the hope of manipulating algorithms and user perceptions. The resulting images, which feature in his new book “Beggar’s Honey,” provide rare insight into the workshops that hire low-paid workers to cultivate likes, comments and shares for businesses and individuals globally.“When most people are on social media, they want nothing but attention — they’re begging for it,” Latham said in a phone interview, explaining his book’s title. “With social media, our attention is a product for advertisers and marketers.”In the 2000s, the growing popularity of social media sites — including Facebook and Twitter, now called X — created a new market for well-curated digital profiles, with companies and brands vying to maximize visibility and influence. Though it is unclear when click farms began proliferating, tech experts warned about “virtual gang masters” operating them from low-income countries as early as 2007.In the following decades, click farms exploded in number — particularly in Asia, where they can be found across India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines and beyond. Regulations have often failed to keep pace: While some countries, like China, have attempted to crack down on operations (the China Advertising Association banned the use of click farms for commercial gain in 2020), they continue to flourish around the continent, especially in places where low labor and electricity costs make it affordable to power hundreds of devices simultaneously.Latham’s project took him to five click farms in Vietnam. (The click farmers he hoped to photograph in Hong Kong “got cold feet,” he said, and pandemic-related travel restrictions dashed his plans to document the practice in mainland China). On the outskirts of Hanoi, Latham visited workshops operating from residential properties and hotels.Some had a traditional setup with hundreds of manually operated phones, while others used a newer, compact method called “box farming” — a phrase used by the click farmers Latham visited — where several phones, without screens and batteries, are wired together and linked to a computer interface.Latham said one of the click farms he visited was a family-run business, though the others appeared more like a tech companies. Most workers were in their 20s and 30s, he added.“They all looked like Silicon Valley startups,” he said. “There was a tremendous amount of hardware … whole walls of phones.”Some of Latham’s photos depict — albeit anonymously — workers tasked with harvesting clicks. In one image, a man is seen stationed amid a sea of gadgets in what appears to be a lonely and monotonous task.“It only takes one person to control large amounts of phones,” Latham said. “One person can very quickly (do the work of) 10,000. It’s both solitary and crowded.”At the farms Lathan visited, individuals were usually in charge of a particular social media platforms. For instance, one “farmer” would be responsible for mass posting and commenting on Facebook accounts, or setting up YouTube platforms where they post and watch videos on loop. The photographer added that TikTok is now the most popular platform at the click farms he visited.The click farmers Latham spoke to mostly advertised their services online for less than one cent per click, view or interaction. And despite the fraudulent nature of their tasks, they seemed to treat it like just another job, the photographer said.‘There was an understanding they were just providing a service,” he added. “There wasn’t a shadiness. What they’re offering is shortcuts.”Across its 134 pages, “Beggar’s Honey” includes a collection of abstract photographs — some seductive, others contemplative — depicting videos that appeared on Latham’s TikTok feed. He included them in the book to represent the kind of content he saw being boosted by click farms.But many of his photos focus on the hardware used to manipulate social media —webs of wires, phones and computers.“A lot of my work is about conspiracies,” Latham said. ” Trying to ‘document the machines used to spread disinformation’ is the tagline of the project. The bigger picture is often the thing we don’t see.”Click farms around the world are also used to amplify political messages and spread disinformation during elections. In 2016, Cambodia’s then-prime minister Hun Sen was accused of buying Facebook friends and likes, which according to the BBC he denied, while shadowy operations in North Macedonia were found to have spread pro-Donald Trump posts and articles during that year’s US presidential election.While researching, Latham said he found that algorithms — a topic of his previous book, “Latent Bloom” — often recommended videos that he said got increasingly “extreme” with each click.“If you only digest a diet of that, it’s a matter of time you become diabetically conspiratorial,” he said. “The spreading of disinformation is the worst thing. It happens in your pocket, not newspapers, and it’s terrifying that it’s tailored to your kind of neurosis.”Hoping to raise awareness of the phenomenon and its dangers, Latham is planning to exhibit his own home version of a click farm — a small box with several phones attached to a computer interface — at the 2024 Images Vevey Festival in Switzerland. He bought the gadget in Vietnam for the equivalent of about $1,000 and has occasionally experimented with it on his social media accounts.On Instagram, Latham’s photos usually attract anywhere from a few dozen to couple hundred likes. But when he deployed his personal click farm to announce his latest book, the post generated more than 6,600 likes. The photographer wants people to realize that there’s more to what they see on social media — and that metrics aren’t a measurement of authenticity.“When people are better equipped with knowledge of how things work, they can make more informed decisions,” he said.“Beggar’s Honey,” co-published by Here Press and Images Vevey, is available now."

        "title": "Rem Koolhaas: ‘In all my buildings, I’m trying to escape’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Rem Koolhaas is always looking for an exit. The Pritzker Prize-winning architect behind the CCTV Headquarters in Beijing, and De Rotterdam in his homeland of the Netherlands, is prone to claustrophobia, and won’t risk triggering it with one of his own buildings. This fear has reshaped skylines, pushing upwards and outwards, leaving behind open, unfussy spaces inside Koolhaas’ modern exteriors. “In all my buildings, you could say I’m trying to escape,” he told CNN.Libraries and Koolhaas are not an obvious fit. The popular image of them — labyrinthine, stuffy, dimly lit ­— hardly aligns with his aesthetic sensibilities (“the typical illumination of libraries is deeply unpleasant,” he remarked). Yet his Seattle Public Library, completed in 2004, is one of his most famous works, and when he designed the Qatar National Library he tore up the rule book once again. Open, airy, you’d never know there were over a million books under its sloping roof, despite so many being so clearly displayed.The building in Doha opened in 2018, and it’s here that CNN recently spoke with the renowned founding partner of international architects OMA.Qatar, on the Arabian peninsula, is home to around three million people, the majority expats. Koolhaas has had multiple projects here, and says of all the places he’s worked, he has “maybe the longest-lasting relationship” with the country.It could’ve started earlier. In the late 1990s, Japanese architect Arata Isozaki was working for a local person of importance and called Koolhaas. “He asked me, do you want to design a bungalow for a horse?” the Dutchman recalled. “I was so puritanical that (I said), ‘A bungalow for a horse? Never.’ Now that I’ve been here much more, I realize that it could have been a fantastic opportunity.”Unsurprisingly for a man who wrote “kill the skyscraper” in 2004, Koolhaas does not believe tall is the be all and end all of place-making. “I still think that skyscrapers are not necessarily the most interesting topology that you can think of,” he said. There are other ways to cement a destination: airports, museums, and, yes, libraries. OMA, which is led by eight partners, has played a part in the stories of nations moving into the global spotlight, and not just Qatar. China, Colombia, Saudi Arabia — the company has produced significant work in them all. But despite having a hand in these narratives, Koolhaas is happy to let go of projects once they’re done.“Once (a building) exists independent of myself, I don’t consider that it was mine. I can almost forget that I was the one who played an important role in generating it,” he explained.In his uniform black turtleneck and trousers (he has a longstanding relationship with Prada), he bristles at the mention of “starchitect,” a moniker which has dogged him for decades. “I hate it. I hate it because it’s a total caricature, and basically says you are an awful person who walks over people, who has no interest in clients, and who is a nightmare to deal with,” he bemoaned.“It’s a form of laziness of the critical apparatus, because I think there’s so much more to say,” Koolhaas added. “The word ‘star architect’ is so superficial in terms of the total engagement that building something requires … ‘Okay, he’s parachuted in and then he does a little trick and disappears.’ Every single building is so much work. I’m not saying that as a victim, but it’s so much work.”Koolhaas has thought extensively in recent years about use of space and resources. “Countryside: The Future,” a Koolhaas-led exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2020, posited the countryside had experienced radical change to make urbanization possible. That it had become a dumping ground for the structures a city needed to survive but could not handle — data storage and fulfilment centers and the like. As an architect commissioned to work at masterplan scale, it amounted to a period of reflection.The city itself is in need of a rethink, he argued. “Ultimately if we are to take sustainability seriously, climate seriously, I think we will maybe enter a period where skylines of cities become less heterogenous,” Koolhaas said. That means fewer extremely tall buildings rubbing shoulders with extreme horizontals. “I can also imagine that there will be a more equal distribution through city and country. I predict — but it’s a very dangerous prediction — that there will be new ways of inhabiting the countryside, but in a more responsible way.”Koolhaas has long been a philosopher king of architecture, both a standard bearer and a critical, contrarian presence. A former journalist, he still writes extensively, a “double life” he said, where he “can do and write what I want,” independent of his office.“It’s been equally exciting to also remain a writer,” he expanded, “and to think about issues that have nothing to do with myself, but that are simply comments on the situation in the world or perceptions; how cultures are changing, or insights in human relations.”The industry has little room for ideologues however, demanding pragmatism and occasional deference to market forces.Koolhaas says in the past, architects largely served a civic function, working for public bodies. The siren song of the private sector emerged around the time he entered the profession, during Ronald Reagan’s and Margaret Thatcher’s political ascendance in the late 1970s and 80s.“The period of neoliberalism that they unleashed of course had a huge impact on architecture,” he said. “In a very subtle way, (it) eroded the plausibility of an architect, because we could no longer say ‘we are doing this for the public,’ or ‘we are doing this for your wellbeing.’ We typically started working for individuals that had their individual ambitions.”Despite Qatar’s centralized power structure, led by an emir who signed off its National Vision 2030 project, Koolhaas names the country as a point of contrast, arguing there is a civic element to the work there. “Of course, they’re private plans, but the state of Qatar is very strong, and has these very defined ambitions, that as an architect you can work within and for,” he argued. “This is the one place where ambition has constantly outworn my skepticism,” he added.The relationship rolls on, with OMA designing the upcoming Qatar Auto Museum. The 30,000 square meter museum, on the site of the 2011 Qatar Motor Show, does not yet have a completion date, but is a fitting symbol for a petrostate pivoting toward a knowledge economy. Expect the usual hallmarks: the clean lines, the playful irreverence, the nods to local shapes and forms.Koolhaas might always be looking for an exit, but not from here."

        "title": "The eyes have it: The intriguing history of kohl",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Kohl use in the Middle East and North Africa is as rich and varied as the region itself. The earliest iteration of eyeliner — which has been integral to Arab culture for millennia — can be traced back to ancient Egypt where it served not only beautification purposes but was also thought to offer protection against the harsh desert sun and even the evil eye (which can signify a curse or an ill-intentioned glance).Over the centuries, the use of kohl spread across the Arabian Peninsula, eventually becoming a staple in the daily lives of both men and women with its wide-ranging applications — aesthetic, medicinal, religious, and practical. It is believed that Crusaders may have brought the practice of using kohl back to Europe.The methods of preparing and applying kohl have also reflected the region’s diverse cultural landscapes. The pigment is typically made from natural materials; Emiratis have historically preferred date seeds, for example, while in Lebanon, cedar honey and even the gallbladder of a hyena have been used.In rural communities, residents often produce their kohl at home, or in group settings. The process involves sourcing readily available ingredients, such as plants, tree sap, or stone, which are then burned to soot, melted, or ground into powders with a mortar and pestle. Much like their Ancient Egyptian counterparts, Emirati women even had their kohl buried with them, along with their jewelry and pottery.During Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, I’ve often thought of Tamam Farhan Abu Issa, a resident of Gaza’s city of Deir al Balah. I stumbled upon her story while researching my book, “Eyeliner: A Cultural History,” which traces the evolution of the cosmetic, from its ancient roots to its modern variations. Using methods passed down for generations, in 2022, Abu Issa spoke enthusiastically of how she sought to preserve the historical art of making kohl. “Okay, girls, this kohl, I made it myself,” she proudly says in a video produced by UNESCO, a United Nations agency, which worked with Palestinian artisans to help document and safeguard traditional handicrafts. “It is an old product that is part of the heritage of the Palestinian people.”Abu Issa demonstrates how to make the pigment: she begins by soaking a piece of cotton cloth in olive oil, using old robes decorated with tatreez (Palestinian embroidery) to absorb the excess oil. She then places the cloth under an aluminum pan and allows it to burn above a flame overnight. The process produces soot, which accumulates on the underside of the pan; the superfine powder is then collected and stored as kohl in ornate brass pots. Abu Issa dips an applicator moistened with olive oil into the pot to gather the pigment, then smoothly drags it along her lash lines, darkening her eyes.Against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, the preservation of customs like kohl-making assumes greater significance in the Palestinian context. As demonstrated by Abu Issa, the process reflects not only one method of creating an age-old cosmetic, but also a deep connection to Palestinian cultural traditions, and by extension, the region’s broader history. Further, the practice embodies a form of cultural continuation — perhaps even cultural resistance.From the deserts of Saudi Arabia and Jordan to Palestinian villages, kohl is used during special occasions such as weddings, childbirth, and religious celebrations. (Abu Issa speaks of how her grandmother advised her to apply kohl around her children’s eyes upon their birth to help them sleep at night, for example). Some Muslims consider the wearing of kohl to be Sunnah — meaning the way of the Prophet Muhammad — given he was said to have worn a form of it to treat his eyes medicinally.The tradition also finds its origins in various communal practices, including those of the Bedouin, the nomadic peoples of the Arabian deserts. There, kohl is traditionally applied not only along the waterlines, for its aesthetic appeal, but also around the entire eye area — beneath the lower lash line and sometimes above the upper lash line. The application has a dual purpose: to enhance the beauty of the eye, and to provide protection against the sun’s glare, wind, and sand. This reverence for kohl is mirrored in Saudi Arabia, where some men (such as the “Flower Men” of the Qahtan tribe) wear it to honor their tribal heritage.In Bedouin society, the application of kohl is also considered a rite of passage into manhood and a marker of singledom. Among the younger Bedouins, there’s a playful acknowledgment of kohl’s impact on one’s appearance: of his heightened good looks after applying kohl, Raed, a 19-year-old Bedouin, jokingly told me in an interview conducted in Petra for my book research, “Do I look like Jack Sparrow, or does Jack Sparrow look like me?’” (In 2010, the cosmetic’s allure spurred the UAE General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments to issue a fatwa, or formal ruling, allowing its use, so long as it wasn’t to attract the opposite sex.)Kohl has withstood the test of time, enduring eras of profound upheaval, including wars, colonialism, occupation, the rise and fall of empires, natural disasters, and significant cultural shifts. It has survived prolonged periods of economic tumult, globalization, and changing beauty standards.As such, well before eyeliner was adopted as a now-ubiquitous cosmetic in the West, it was already deeply entrenched in Middle Eastern and North African cultures. In the region’s folklore, literature, song, and dance, kohl has been celebrated for centuries. The image of kohl-lined eyes is a recurring motif in various Arab art forms: in poetry, for example, Middle Eastern and Arab women are portrayed as being staggeringly beautiful in part due to their “oyoun al sood” (black eyes) or “oyoun kaheela” (kohl-rimmed eyes.) Kohl is so commonly worn in the area that girls are sometimes named or nicknamed Kahla by their parents or friends, roughly meaning “the girl who appears to have kohl around her eyes.” Kohl is also a feature of many ­millennia-old myths, rituals, and legends. Zarqa al‑­Yamama (Blue Dove), a heroine of pre­-Islamic folklore, was famed for the strength of her eyesight, which was credited to her use of kohl.Today, kohl maintains its status across the Arab world and in Muslim communities, though its use has evolved. On social media platforms, kohl has gained popularity among young women, bridging tradition and modernity. Instagram and TikTok feeds feature posts from Arab and Muslim influencers and makeup enthusiasts showcasing their kohl-lined eyes. “There we are!” says TikTok influencer “Blinkaria Kohl Girl” (who has more than 33m likes) after applying the product in a tutorial. “You get waterline and tightline.” (Waterlining involves drawing eyeliner onto the inner rim of the eyelids for a dramatic look, while tightlining is the application of pigment at the base of the lashes for a subtle, fuller-lash effect; both are centuries-old).Younger generations have incorporated modern beauty trends like liquid eyeliner into their routines as urban areas have experienced a shift towards imported Western or South Asian eyeliner brands for practical purposes. “Kohl is simple to make,” observed Abu Issa of Gaza, “but many women find it easier to use ready-made products. This could be because they are impatient or want to avoid getting their hands dirty.” Handmade kohl (often purchased from local souks or sellers) is still sought after despite these shifts, particularly among those who value cultural continuity. Maram, an Egyptian woman in her mid-30s, told me in an interview for my book, “I grew up believing kohl was a traditional Egyptian practice. When I started using kohl as a teenager, I thought it looked cool. And I’ve continued to wear it every day since.”For Abu Issa and indeed many across the Arab world, myself included, making kohl is not only a craft; it is a tangible link to her grandmother’s legacy, and to her identity. “Even if she doesn’t (make kohl) anymore, I will for sure continue to do this myself,” Abu Issa said. “I’m happy to produce something for my personal use. I’ve done something good for myself.”"

        "title": "I’m 70 years old — why shouldn’t my clothes convey my sexuality, and sense of style?",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "(CNN) — In the fall of 2019, I received an e-mail from a group of Parsons Fashion Design and Society MFA students who had been given the assignment to make a collection of clothes for “seniors,” as part of a course that involves creating designs that focus on disabled, plus-size, transgender and aging people. The students were divided into four teams, with each team charge to find a muse/collaborator within their respective category — to ensure primary research and a meaningful outcome. The students asked me for an interview, hoping that I might become their muse.The students had gone around to senior centers, asking what older people want in their clothing. The answers — focused more on issues of fit, comfort and disguising signs of age — had discouraged them. Though these elements are important, the students seemed to want an aesthetic of age that could inspire them; they want to make old age high fashion, something beyond just function. (I think to myself that these fashionable young people want to design clothes they can see themselves in when they grow old.) But as we speak together, the fluid internal experience of aging, the memories held, and the desire to evoke them in what we wear are topics they become animated and excited about. Along with their tutors, these students and I begin our work together.The process starts with me bringing in pieces from my wardrobe that hold meaning for me: There is the sleeveless A-line dress with pastel green and purple flowers that I wore under my doctoral gown the day I received my PhD; the Yohji Yamamoto suit I wore to my first day of class as a professor of social work and law. There is an oversized burnt-orange coat that covers me like a blanket, which I wear when I want to feel warm and safe, and a paisley Indian print dress I wore in the 1970s and now throw on when I go to the beach. Its colors are faded, and the thin cotton fabric is almost transparent after being worn for so many years — it seems on the brink of disintegration.We have many conversations about the experiences attached to clothing during different periods of my life. We discuss how what I wear now, or want to wear, can allow experiences from different times of my life to be remembered. My young friends are curious about how I came to be empowered to wear what I want, to use clothes as devices to tell my personal stories and see style as being unique to every person.I shared with them how my partner Calvin and I were recently walking around Harlem taking photos, and came upon the only remaining Kangol hat store in the world. I’m not a hat person at all, but I had a Kangol beret I used to wear backwards with overalls and a velvet shirt silk screened with Our Lady of Guadalupe when I was first exploring my creative self in the early 1990s, right after I left my marriage and was about to turn 40. (The shirt was a nod to my preoccupation with Frida Kahlo after a trip to Mexico, but I digress.)The point is that when I walked into that store, I was transported back to that time. I heard the music and remember the galleries I went to, the classes I took and the books I read. So I try to explain to the students that it’s not that I need to wear exactly what I wore then, but clothes that evoke feelings and memories I felt. An approach to style that comes from our unique identities can convey a sense of time and place. And an article of clothing or an accessory contains history; it is a device that one can use to tell a story, one that is as different as the people who put it on.The students and I speak a good deal about what it means to be old. Each week I arrive for a fitting of what they design, and the tutors give a critique. This becomes a conversation about how bodies change as we age.The tutors and I observed how stereotypes and preconceived notions about being old found their way into the sessions, giving us the opportunity to question them. How the students’ initial designs cover me completely, for example, not acknowledging that I might still be a sexual being. By default, clothing for other adults is made to cover up their aging bodies. After this conversation, the textiles become more transparent — though they remain respectful.Usually, garments made for aging bodies are not modern or representative because they don’t take into consideration the disconnect between the internal experiences of older people and the reality of their physical bodies. Many older people still feel youthful and engaged.This results in the production of intricately crafted bespoke textiles, and clothes are not retro but modern — clothes that convey the sexuality and rebellious spirit that still inhabits me. The students create a dress made of crocheted Paisley prints in oranges and earth tones; a black coat with visible layers of varying tones and textures of grey and shaped like a cocoon that opens to reveal a transparent shirt; pants and a tunic with green and purple flowers caught in a spider web knit. These are pieces that turn remembering and aging into something that is modern and new — not just a retrospective view of a long life.Each outfit created became a scene that performed a story of a life, a narrative that revealed some secrets about how to be old.For the students, understanding the developing nature of identity as opportunity and deconstructing standardized notions of the “ideal” body are gifts they took away from the process. In their designs, they layered years of memory and meaning and saw aging in a way that was additive, not subtractive — something to look forward to.The clothes the students designed for me made me feel understood. Working with younger people and solving this problem together reminds me of the utility of intergenerational collaboration, deep listening and mutual respect. Can you imagine, if we worked together so creatively on the multitude of issues we face in this current time, how we might change the way we think about being old or young?"

        "text": "Taylor Swift might be saying “So Long, London” in her much-anticipated upcoming album but one of the city’s top museums is offering the dream job for any Swiftie.On Thursday, the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) released a job listing for a Taylor Swift superfan to advise its expert curators and explain her importance to the history of art and design, in which the museum specializes.The successful fan will have the chance to view relevant items from the V&A’s collection of more than 2.8 million objects and potentially help influence the museum’s future programming, it said.They should be able to offer “insights into the culture and artisanry” around the friendship bracelets that Swifties often exchange, as well as the handmade signs frequently displayed at concerts, the V&A told CNN in a statement on Friday.Swapping distinctive friendship bracelets, often featuring the names of Swift songs and albums or the names of the fans themselves, has become one of the rituals associated with attending an “Eras” tour concert.The tradition was inspired by the lyrics of “You’re on Your Own, Kid,” a track from Swift’s 2022 album “Midnights,” as she sings about making friendship bracelets as a way to connect with others over a shared experience.And friendship bracelets play a starring role in the origin story of her relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce. He said in July on his podcast that he had attempted to give Swift a bracelet with his number on it at one of her concerts. She heard about it and got in touch, and the couple started dating, she told Time in December.Artifacts such as these bracelets and the homemade, often ornate, signs that fans take to concerts provide a tangible mark of the economic, cultural and social phenomenon that has been the “Eras” tour, which started in March last year and is due to end in December.The role is part of the V&A’s efforts to “bring in grassroots expertise in highly specific cultural niches” to complement the “vast curatorial knowledge” of the museum’s experts, it said.Beside Swifties, the V&A is also looking for superfans of Crocs, drag, emojis and tufting – a technique used in rug-making – to help inform their exhibitions, asking potential applicants to highlight their own collections.It has already recruited experts in Lego, Pokémon, Gorpcore – a trend in which hiking clothing is worn as an everyday outfit – and Toby jugs, which are made in the shape of a seated person.Tristram Hunt, the museum’s director, said in a statement that the roles will help “discover more about the enormous, and often surprising, creative diversity on offer at the V&A, as well as helping us to learn more about the design stories that are relevant to our audiences today.”The museum did not stipulate a salary for the part-time, zero-hours role but said that it will cover “reasonable” travel costs and that successful candidates will receive a V&A Membership."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Three Belgian climate activists who were previously sentenced to prison for a protest targeting Johannes Vermeer’s painting “Girl with a Pearl Earring” will no longer face any punishment for their actions, a Dutch court of appeal ruled on Monday.The demonstrators, who are part of the campaign group Just Stop Oil Belgium, were originally given two-month jail sentences for their protest, which took place in October 2022 at the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, the Netherlands.One man glued his head to the glass protecting the famous painting, while another threw tomato soup over the first man and then glued his own hand to the wall. A third man filmed the demonstration.The museum said after the incident that the 17th-century masterpiece was “undamaged,” and it was returned to public view the next day. The Netherlands Public Prosecution Service added that the 19th-century frame had, however, been damaged in the protest.The men were convicted of causing destruction and damage to the painting, as well as public violence, a spokesperson for The Hague Court of Appeal told CNN, adding that the protestors spent 23 days in detention before the trial.Given the length of time that the demonstrators spent in pre-trial detention, the court said, a prison sentence would have been excessive.The court spokesperson told CNN that it also did not want to discourage others who wish to peacefully protest or exercise their right to freedom of expression. To punish these activists severely might have a “chilling effect” on others, the court said in a media statement.CNN has reached out to the Mauritshuis museum for comment.Just Stop Oil Belgium is not affiliated with its British namesake, environmental activist group Just Stop Oil. CNN was unable to contact the Belgian organization directly but has reached out to Extinction Rebellion Belgium for comment, as it has previously issued statements on behalf of Just Stop Oil Belgium."

        "title": "50 of the world’s best breads",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "What is bread? You likely don’t have to think for long, and whether you’re hungry for a slice of sourdough or craving some tortillas, what you imagine says a lot about where you’re from.But if bread is easy to picture, it’s hard to define.Bread historian William Rubel argues that creating a strict definition of bread is unnecessary, even counterproductive. “Bread is basically what your culture says it is,” says Rubel, the author of “Bread: A Global History.” “It doesn’t need to be made with any particular kind of flour.”Instead, he likes to focus on what bread does: It turns staple grains such as wheat, rye or corn into durable foods that can be carried into the fields, used to feed an army or stored for winter.Even before the first agricultural societies formed around 10,000 BCE, hunter-gatherers in Jordan’s Black Desert made bread with tubers and domesticated grain.Today, the descendants of those early breads showcase the remarkable breadth of our world’s food traditions.In the rugged mountains of Germany’s Westphalia region, bakers steam loaves of dense rye for up to 24 hours, while a round of Armenian lavash made from wheat turns blistered and brown after 30 seconds inside a tandoor oven.Ethiopian cooks ferment injera’s ground-teff batter into a tart, bubbling brew, while the corn dough for Venezuelan arepas is patted straight onto a sizzling griddle.This list reflects that diversity. Along with memorable flavor, these breads are chosen for their unique ingredients, iconic status and the sheer, homey pleasure of eating them.From the rich layers of Malaysian roti canai to Turkey’s seed-crusted simit, they’re a journey through the essence of global comfort food – and a reminder that creativity, like bread, is a human inheritance.In alphabetical order by location, here are 50 of the world’s most wonderful breads.Golden blisters of crisp dough speckle a perfectly made bolani, but the real treasure of Afghanistan’s favorite flatbread is hidden inside.After rolling out the yeast-leavened dough into a thin sheet, Afghan bakers layer bolani with a generous filling of potatoes, spinach or lentils. Fresh herbs and scallions add bright flavor to the chewy, comforting dish, which gets a crispy crust when it’s fried in shimmering-hot oil.When your Armenian mother-in-law comes towards you wielding a hula hoop-sized flatbread, don’t duck: Lavash is draped over the country’s newlyweds to ensure a life of abundance and prosperity.Maybe that’s because making lavash takes friends.To shape the traditional breads, groups of women gather to roll and stretch dough across a cushion padded with hay or wool. It takes a practiced hand to slap the enormous sheets onto the inside of conical clay ovens, where they bake quickly in the intense heat.The bread is so central to Armenia’s culture it’s been designated UNESCO Intangible Heritage.A traveler’s staple suited to life on the road, damper recalls Australia’s frontier days.It’s a simple blend of water, flour and salt that can be cooked directly in the ashes, pressed into a cast iron pan or even toasted at the end of a stick. These days, recipes often include some chemical leavening, butter and milk, turning the hearty backwoods fare into a more refined treat similar to Irish soda bread.A dunk in hot oil turns soft wheat dough into a blistered, golden flatbread that’s a perfect pairing with the country’s aromatic curries.It’s a popular choice for breakfast in Bangladesh, often served with white potato curry, but you can find the puffy breads everywhere from Dhaka sidewalk stalls to home kitchens.It’s a triumph of kitchen ingenuity that South America’s native cassava is eaten at all: The starchy root has enough naturally occurring cyanide to kill a human being.But by carefully treating cassava with a cycle of soaking, pressing and drying, many of the continent’s indigenous groups found a way to turn the root into an unlikely culinary star. Now, it’s the base for one of Brazil’s most snackable treats, a cheesy bread roll whose crisp crust gives way to a tender, lightly sour interior.The fire is always lit at Montreal’s Fairmount Bagel, which became the city’s first bagel bakery when it opened in 1919 under the name Montreal Bagel Bakery.Inside, bakers use long, slender wooden paddles to slide rows of bagels into the wood-fired oven, where they toast to a deep golden color.New Yorkers might think they have a monopoly on bagels, but the Montreal version is an entirely different delicacy.Here, bagel dough is mixed with egg and honey, and the hand-shaped rings are boiled in honey water before baking. The result is dense, chewy and lightly sweet, and you can buy them hot from the oven 24 hours a day.An influx of European immigrants brought their wheat-bread traditions to Chile in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the country’s favorite snack has descended from that cultural collision.Split into four lobes, the marraqueta has a pale, fluffy interior, but the ubiquitous roll is all about the crust. Bakers slide a pan of water into the oven to achieve an addictively crispy exterior that is a favorite part of the marraqueta for many Chileans.It’s a nourishing part of daily life, to the extent that when a Chilean wants to describe a child born to a life of plenty, they might say “nació con la marraqueta bajo el brazo,” or “they were born with a marraqueta under their arm.”Crack into the sesame-seed crust of a shaobing to reveal tender layers that are rich with wheat flavor.Expert shaobing bakers whirl and slap the dough so thin that the finished product has 18 or more layers. The north Chinese flatbread can then be spiked with sweet or savory fillings, from black sesame paste to smoked meat or Sichuan pepper.Melted lard lends a hint of savory flavor to loaves of pan Cubano, whose fluffy crumb offers a tender contrast to the crisp, cracker-like crust.Duck into a Cuban bakery, and you’ll likely spot the long, golden loaf with a pale seam down the center: Some bakers press a stripped palmetto leaf into the dough before baking to create a distinctive crack along the length of the bread.It’s popular from Havana to Miami, but it’s only stateside that you’ll find the loaves in “Cuban sandwiches,” which are thought to have been invented during the 19th century by Cubans living in Florida.Bedouin tribes travel light in Egypt’s vast deserts, carrying sacks of wheat flour to make each day’s bread in the campfire.While some Bedouin breads are baked on hot metal sheets, libba is slapped directly into the embers. That powerful heat sears a crisp, browned crust onto the soft dough, leaving the inside steaming and moist.Walk the streets of San Salvador, and you’ll never be far from the toasted-corn scent of cooking pupusas.The griddled corn bread is both a beloved snack and a national icon.To make pupusas, a cook wraps a filling of cheese, pork or spiced beans into tender corn dough, then pats the mixture onto a blazing-hot griddle. A bright topping of slaw-like curtido cuts through the fat and salt for a satisfying meal.It’s a flavor that’s endured through the centuries. At the UNESCO-listed site of Joya de Cerén, a Maya city buried by an erupting volcano, archaeologists have found cooking tools like those used to make pupusas that date to around 600 A.D.A constellation of bubbles pocks injera’s spongy surface, making this Ethiopian bread the perfect foil for the country’s rich sauces and stews.Also beloved in neighboring Eritrea and Somalia, injera is both a mealtime staple and the ultimate utensil – tear off tender pieces of moist, rolled-up bread to scoop food served on a communal platter.Made from an ancient – and ultra-nutritious – grain called teff, injera has a characteristically sour taste. It’s the result of a fermentation process that starts by blending fresh batter with cultures from a previous batch, then leaving the mixture to grow more flavorful over several days.The French may frown on eating on the go, but there’s an unofficial exception for “le quignon,” the crisp-baked end of a slender baguette.You’re allowed to break that off and munch it as you walk down the street – perhaps because the baguette has pride of place as a symbol of French culture.But like some of the greatest traditions, the baguette is a relatively recent invention.According to Paris food historian Jim Chevallier, long, narrow breads similar to modern baguettes gained prominence in the 19th century, and the first official mention is in a 1920 price list. (French President Emmanuel Macron nonetheless argues that the baguette deserves UNESCO status.)Bubbling with fresh imeruli and sulguni cheeses, khachapuri might be the country of Georgia’s most beloved snack.The savory flatbread starts with soft, yeasted dough that’s pinched into a boat-shaped cradle, then baked with a generous filling of egg and cheese. An elongated shape maximizes the contrast in texture, from the tender interior to crisp, brown tips. Khachapuri experts know to break off the ends for swabbing in the rich, oozing filling.It’s such a key feature of Georgian cuisine that the Khachapuri Index is one measure of the country’s economic welfare; and in 2019, the country’s National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation named traditional khachapuri as UNESCO Intangible Heritage of Georgia.Pure rye flour lends these iconic north German loaves impressive heft, along with a distinctive, mahogany hue.The most traditional versions are baked in a warm, steamy oven for up to 24 hours. It’s an unusual technique that helps transform sugars in the rye flour, turning naturally occurring sweetness into depth of flavor.Pumpernickel has been a specialty in Germany’s Westphalia region for hundreds of years, and there’s even a family-owned bakery in the town of Soest that’s made the hearty bread using the same recipe since 1570.Hong Kong bakers outdo each other by crafting the softest, fluffiest breads imaginable, turning wheat flour into pillowy confections.Pai bao might be loftier than all the rest, thanks to a technique known as the Tangzhong method.When mixing the wheat dough, bakers add a small amount of cooked flour and water to the rest of the ingredients, a minor change with major impact on the bread’s structural development. The results? A wonderfully tender loaf that retains moisture for days, with a milky flavor that invites snacking out of hand.The simmering, geothermal heat that powers Iceland’s geysers, hot springs and steam vents also provides a natural oven for this slow-baked Icelandic rye bread.Made with dark rye flour, the dough is enclosed in a metal pot before it’s buried in the warm ground near geothermal springs and other hotspots. When baked in the traditional method, dökkt rúgbrauð takes a full 24 hours to cook in the subterranean “oven.”It’s an ingenious use of an explosive natural resource, and in the hot-springs town of Laugarvatn, visitors can try loaves of dökkt rúgbrauð when it’s fresh from a hole in the black sand.Flatbreads go wonderfully flaky in this whole-wheat Indian treat, which can be eaten plain or studded with savory fillings.Folding and rolling the dough over thinly spread fat creates sumptuous layers that are rich with flavor, employing a technique similar to that used for croissants or puff pastry.Stuffed wheat bread has been made in India for hundreds of years, and several varieties even get a shout-out in the “Manasollasa,” a 12th-century Sanskrit text that contains some of the earliest written descriptions of the region’s food.Palm sugar and cinnamon lend a light, aromatic sweetness to roti gambang, a tender wheat bread that’s an old-fashioned favorite at Jakarta bakeries.The name evokes the gambang, a traditional Indonesian instrument with a resemblance to the slender, brown loaves.For the recipe, though, cooks look back to the colonial era: From spiced holiday cookies to cheese sticks topped with Gouda or Edam, Indonesian baking has adapted Dutch ingredients and techniques to local tastes.It takes a pair of deft bakers to craft this addictive Iranian flatbread, which is cooked directly on a bed of hot pebbles.That blazing-hot surface pocks the wheat dough with golden blisters, and it gives sangak – also known as nan-e sangak – a characteristic chewiness.If you’re lucky enough to taste sangak hot from the oven, enjoy a heavenly contrast of crisp crust and tender crumb. Eat the flatbread on its own, or turn it into an Iranian-style breakfast: Use a piece of sangak to wrap salty cheese and a bundle of aromatic green herbs.You don’t need yeast to get lofty bread: Chemical leavening can add air through an explosive combination of acidic and basic ingredients. While Native Americans used refined potash to leaven griddled breads – an early example of chemical leavening – this version became popular during the lean years of the Irish Potato Famine.With potato crops failing, impoverished Irish people started mixing loaves using soft wheat flour, sour milk and baking soda.Now, dense loaves of soda bread are a nostalgic treat that’s a perfect pairing with salted Irish butter.If you think challah is limited to pillowy, braided loaves, think again – traditionally, challah is any bread used in Jewish ritual.And Jewish bakers have long made breads as diverse as the diaspora itself: Think blistered flatbreads, hearty European loaves and Hungarian confections dotted with poppy seeds.Israel’s modern-day bakers draw on that rich heritage. But on Friday afternoons in Tel Aviv, you’ll still spot plenty of the classic Ashkenazi versions that many people in the United States know as challah.Those golden loaves are tender with eggs, and shiny under a generous glaze. It’s the braid, though, that catches the eye. By wrapping dough strands together, bakers create 12 distinctive mounds said to represent 12 loaves in the ancient Temple of Jerusalem.Between an emphasis on “ancient grains” and centuries of floury traditions, it can seem like breadmaking is stuck in the past.But bread is continually evolving, and there’s no better example than this iconic Italian loaf, which was only invented in the 1980s.In 1982, Italian baker Arnaldo Cavallari created the low, chewy loaf in defiance of the baguette-style breads he saw taking over Roman bakeries.It was a watershed moment in the comeback of artisanal breads, which has roots in the 1960s and 1970s backlash against the increasingly industrialized food system.Pan-fried cassava cakes are delicious comfort food in Jamaica, where rounds of bammy bread are a hearty pairing for the island’s ultra-fresh seafood.The traditional process for making bammy bread starts with processing grated cassava to get rid of naturally occurring cyanide; next, sifted cassava pulp is pressed into metal rings.It’s a recipe with ancient roots – cassava has been a staple in South America and the Caribbean since long before the arrival of Europeans here, and it’s believed that the native Arawak people used the root to make flatbreads as well.Yeasted wheat dough makes a convenient package for Japanese curry, turning a sit-down meal into a snack that can be eaten out of hand.Kare pan, or curry bread, is rolled in panko before a dunk in the deep fryer, ensuring a crispy crust that provides maximum textural contrast with the soft, saucy interior.Kare pan is so beloved that there’s even a crime-fighting superhero named for the savory treat: A star of the anime series “Soreike! Anpanman,” Karepanman fights villains by shooting out a burning-hot curry filling.Follow the aroma of baking bread in Amman, and you’ll find bakers in roadside stalls stacking this classic flatbread into steaming piles.When shaping taboon, bakers press rounds of soft, wheat dough over a convex form, then slap them onto the interior of a conical clay oven.What emerges is a chewy round that’s crackling with steam, wafting a rich smell of grain and smoke. It’s the ideal foil for a plate of Jordanian mouttabal, a roasted eggplant dip that’s blended with ground sesame seeds and yogurt.Roti flatbread may have arrived in Malaysia with Indian immigrants, but the country’s made the flaky, rich bread their own.When cooked on a hot griddle, roti canai puffs into a stack of overlapping layers rich with buttery flavor. Irresistible when served with Malaysian dips and curries, roti canai becomes a meal all its own with the addition of stuffings from sweet, ripe bananas to fried eggs.The tawny crust of Malta’s sourdough gives way to a pillow-soft interior, ideal for rubbing with a fresh tomato or soaking up the islands’ prized olive oils.Classic versions take more than a day to prepare, and were traditionally baked in shared, wood-fired ovens that served as community gathering places.Even now that few Maltese bake their own bread, Ħobż tal-Malti has a powerful symbolism for the Mediterranean island nation.When trying to discover someone’s true nature, a Maltese person might ask “x’ħobz jiekol dan?,” literally, “what kind of bread does he eat?”Thin rounds of corn dough turn blistered and brown on a hot comal, the traditional griddles that have been used in Mexico since at least 700 BCE.Whether folded into a taco or eaten out of hand, corn tortillas are one of the country’s most universally loved foods. The ground-corn dough is deceptively simple; made from just a few ingredients, it’s nonetheless a triumph of culinary ingenuity.Before being ground, the corn is mixed with an alkaline ingredient such as lime, a process called nixtamalization that makes the grain more nutritious and easier to digest.Follow the rich scent of baking bread through a Moroccan medina, and you may find yourself at one of the communal neighborhood ovens called ferran. This is where locals bring rounds of tender wheat dough ready to bake into khobz kesra, one of the country’s homiest breads.The low, rounded loaves have a slightly crisp exterior that earns them pride of place on the Moroccan table, where their fluffy texture is ideal for absorbing aromatic tajine sauce.Golden, crisp rounds of fry bread are a taste of home for many in the Navajo Nation, as well as a reminder of a tragic history.When Navajo people were forced out of their Arizona lands by the US government in 1864, they resettled in New Mexican landscapes where growing traditional crops of beans and vegetables proved difficult.To survive, they used government-provided stores of white flour, lard and sugar, creating fry bread out of stark necessity.Now, fry bread is a symbol of perseverance and tradition, and a favorite treat everywhere from powwows to family gatherings.Putting the “Dutch” in Dutch crunch, tijgerbrood is a crust-lover’s masterpiece in every crispy bite.To create the mottled top of tijgerbrood, bakers spread unbaked loaves of white bread with a soft mixture of rice flour, sesame oil, water and yeast.Heat transforms the exterior into a crispy pattern of snackable pieces, and loaves of tijgerbrood are beloved for sandwiches. (An ocean away from Amsterdam’s Old World bakeries, San Francisco has made Dutch crunch its sandwich bread of choice as well.)When European settlers brought potatoes and wheat to New Zealand, indigenous Maori people made the imported ingredients their own with this innovative bread.To mix the dough, potatoes are boiled then fermented into a sourdough-like starter that gives the finished bread a sweet-and-sour taste.Now, rēwena parāoa is a favorite treat when layered with butter and jam or served with a hearty portion of raw fish, a longtime delicacy for Maori people.If you don’t think of northern Europe as flatbread country, you haven’t tasted lefse.The Norwegian potato flatbread is a favorite at holidays, when there are many hands to roll the soft dough with a grooved pin, then cook it on a hot griddle. For a taste of Norwegian comfort food, eat a warm lefse spiraled with butter, sugar and a dash of cinnamon.While potatoes are just an 18th-century addition to the Norwegian diet, Scandinavian flatbread is at least as old as the Vikings.Slather a hot round of podplomyk with white cheese and fruit preserves for a taste of old-fashioned, Polish home cooking.The unyeasted flatbread is blistered brown. With ingredients limited to wheat flour, salt and water, podplomyk is a deliciously simple entry in the sprawling family tree of flatbreads.Since dough for podplomyk is rolled thin, it was traditionally baked before other loaves are ready for the oven. In the Middle Ages, the portable breads were shared with neighbors and household members as a sign of friendship. (Today, that tradition is carried on with the exchange of oplatek wafers at Christmastime.)Corn and buckwheat are stone-milled, sifted and kneaded in a wooden trough for the most traditional version of this hearty peasant bread from northern Portugal.When the loaves are baked in wood-fired, stone ovens, an archipelago of floury crust shards expands over deep cracks. The ovens themselves are sealed with bread dough, which acts as a natural oven timer: The bread is ready when the dough strips turn toasty brown.Europeans didn’t taste corn until they arrived in the Americas, but it would be eagerly adopted in northern Portuguese regions where soil conditions are poorly suited to growing wheat.Bread baking becomes art on Russian holidays, when golden loaves of karavai are decked in dough flowers, animals and swirls.The bread plays a starring role at weddings, with elaborate rules to govern the baking process: Traditionally, a happily married woman must mix the dough, and a married man slides the round loaf into the oven.Even the round shape has an ancient symbolism and is thought to date back to ancient sun worship. Now, it’s baked to ensure health and prosperity for a new couple.Once part of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, this mountainous island’s cuisine remains distinct from mainland Italy. Among the most iconic foods here is pane carasau, parchment-thin flatbread with a melodic nickname: carta de musica, or sheet music.While pane carasau starts like a classic flatbread, there’s a Sardinian twist that makes it an ideal traveling companion; after the flatbreads puff up in the oven, they’re sliced horizontally into two thinner pieces. Those pieces are baked a second time, drying out the bread enough to last for months.Warm squares of Serbian proja, or cornbread, are a favorite accompaniment to the country’s lush meat stews.It’s a homey dish that’s often cooked fresh for family meals, then served hot from the oven. Ground corn offers a lightly sweet foil to salty toppings, from salty kajmak cheese to a scattering of cracklings.There’s buried treasure within every loaf of gyeran-ppang, individually sized wheat breads with a whole egg baked inside.Translating simply to “egg bread,” gyeran-ppang is a favorite in the streets of Seoul, eaten hot for breakfast – or at any other time of day.The addition of ham, cheese and chopped parsley adds a savory twist to the sweet-and-salty treat, a belly-warming snack that keeps South Korea fueled through the country’s long winters.A thin, fermented batter of rice flour and coconut milk turns crisp in the bowl-shaped pans used for cooking appam, one of Sri Lanka’s most ubiquitous treats.Often called hoppers, this whisper-thin pancake is best eaten hot – preferably while standing around a Colombo street food stall.Favorite toppings for appam in Sri Lanka include coconut sambal and chicken curry, or you can order one with egg. For egg hoppers, a whole egg is cracked into the center of an appam, then topped with a richly aromatic chili paste. Appam is also popular in southern India.Overnight fermentation lends a delicious tang to this Sudanese flatbread, balancing the mild, earthy flavor of sorghum flour with a tart bite.Making the crepe-like kisra takes practice and patience, but perfect the art of cooking these on a flat metal pan and you’ll be in for a classic Sudanese treat.Like Ethiopian injera, kisra is both staple food and an edible utensil – use pieces of the spongy bread to scoop up spicy bites of the hearty stews that are some of Sudan’s most beloved foods.Before commercial yeast was available, brewers and bakers worked in tandem: Brewers harvested yeast from their batches of beer, passing it off to bakers whose bread would be infused with a light beer flavor.That legacy lives on in Sweden’s vörtlimpa: Limpa means loaf, while vört refers to a tart dose of brewer’s wort. Known as limpa bread in English, the light rye now gets acidity from orange juice, not brewers wort.Crops of cold-hardy barley have thrived on the Tibetan Plateau for thousands of years, and the grain has long been a staple of high-altitude diets there.While balep korkun is often made with wheat, traditional versions of this flatbread are shaped from tsampa, a roasted barley flour with nutty flavor.That rich-tasting flour is so central to Tibetan identity that it’s been turned into a hashtag and been called out in rap songs. (The Dalai Lama even eats it for breakfast.)Dredged in sesame seeds and spiraled into rings, simit might be Turkey’s ultimate on-the-go treat.A few decades ago, vendors wound through the Istanbul streets carrying trays piled high with the breads, but roving bread-sellers are now rare in the capital.Instead, commuters pick up their daily simit at roadside stands, where the deep-colored rings are stacked by the dozen. A burnished crust infuses the breads with a light sweetness – before sliding into wood fired ovens, simit is dunked in sugar-water or thinned molasses, a slick glaze that turns to caramel in the intense heat.Yeasted wheat batter bubbles into a spongy cake for this griddled treat, a British favorite when smeared with jam, butter or clotted cream.Ring molds contain the pourable batter on an oiled griddle, which cooks one side of each crumpet to a golden hue. Like Eastern European zwieback and crisp rusks, crumpets are mostly eaten as a twice-baked bread – the rounds are split and toasted before serving.Smeared with butter or dripping in gravy, biscuits are one of the United States’ homiest tastes. That’s not to say they’re easy to make: Achieving soft, fluffy biscuits requires quick hands and gentle mixing.In the antebellum South, biscuits were seen as a special treat for Sunday dinner. These days they’re nearly ubiquitous, from gas station barbecue joints to home-cooked meals.Part of the secret is in the flour, typically a low-protein flour like White Lily. The soft wheat used for White Lily was long grown in Southern states – before long-distance food shipping. (It’s now milled in the Midwest.)Flatbreads become art in Uzbekistan’s traditional tandoor ovens, which turn out rounds adorned with twists, swirls and stamps.Uzbek non varies across regions, from Tashkent’s chewy versions to Samarkand loaves showered in black nigella seeds. As soon as the breads emerge from the oven, they’re turned over to a swarm of bicycle messengers who ferry the hot loaves to markets and cafes.Areperos – Venezuelan arepa-makers – pat golden rounds of corn dough onto hot griddles to give the plump flatbreads a deliciously toasted crust and tender, steaming interior.Arepas have been made in Venezuela and surrounding regions since long before the arrival of Europeans in South America, and the nourishing corn breads can range from simple to elaborate.At breakfast, try them split and buttered. Stuffed with savory fillings, creamy sauces and fiery salsa, arepas can become a hearty meal all their own.A family tree of flatbreads stretches across the Middle East and beyond, but Yemen’s Jewish community’s version is a richer treat than most.To make malawach, bakers roll wheat dough into a delicate sheet and fold it over a slick of melted butter. The dough is twisted into a loose topknot, then re-rolled, sending veins of butter through overlapping layers.When the pan-fried dough emerges steaming from the stovetop, a final shower of black nigella or sesame seeds add texture and savory crunch."

        "title": "She went on a solo trip to Italy. Right away she met the love of her life",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar, alone.“I’ll go for one song and suss it out,” she thought, trying to quieten her nerves.Kacie slipped in at the back. The club was dark and busy, a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking, dancing and chatting. Before she could even take in the musicians on stage, Kacie’s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar.“I walked in and he was there,” Kacie tells CNN Travel today. “We clocked eyes.”“Ciao,” said the stranger, smiling.“Ciao,” Kacie said back, before adding apologetically: “That’s all the Italian I’ve got for you.”It was October 2018. Kacie was a 24-year-old New Yorker on vacation in Florence. It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo. It was an exciting – and terrifying – experience.“I was a professional dancer in New York,” explains Kacie. “A very exhausting career – there’s a lot of toxicity, a lot of rejection, there’s a lot of politics that come into play – and I was feeling a little stuck, a little unhappy, a little – just stagnant, if you will.”Kacie spent her days auditioning, traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store. She needed a break, and she’d long felt a “pull” to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation.“I kept saying, ‘I’ll wait for somebody to go with, I’ll wait, I’ll wait. And then I was waiting for years. And so then one night – at two in the morning – I was like, ‘What am I waiting for? Life is too short.’ So I booked a solo trip to Italy.”Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence. But in the lead-up to the trip, she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at. This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city’s praises, persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint.And that’s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening.“I’m really glad that I listened to her,” says Kacie. “That’s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence, on that earlier day that I wasn’t originally supposed to be there.”The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was 26-year-old Dario Nencetti, a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights. It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week.The jazz bar, called Jazz Club Firenze, was one of Dario’s favorite hangouts. He loved the music, the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions.“That place is, let’s say, unconventional for Florence,” Dario tells CNN Travel. “Usually in Florence, there’s like a table for two or three or four people. In the jazz club, there are big tables, so you can sit with strangers and stuff, which I love.”When Dario realized Kacie didn’t know much Italian beyond “ciao,” they switched to English. Dario told Kacie he’d lived in Scotland for a year, and they got talking about travel. Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he’d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year.“We bonded from the beginning,” says Dario. “It was really natural, really easy conversation.”“I remember he made me laugh,” says Kacie. “And I was like, ‘Oh, this guy’s interesting.” So many people ask us, ‘How did you know?’ And I don’t know how I knew. I was just like, ‘Oh, this is something different.’”Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning. Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days.“He would meet me after his work – every night he got off at 11. And we would go out and we would just talk,” recalls Kacie. “I instantly fell in love with Florence. It’s a very romantic city - cobblestone streets and medieval buildings. It looks like a painting everywhere you look.”It was a whirlwind two days. One evening they sat by Florence’s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until 3 or 4 a.m. It was as though Kacie was in a film – somewhere between every millennial’s favorite “The Lizzie McGuire Movie” and classic Florentine romance “A Room with a View.”Then, the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip. It was still like something from a movie – only it wasn’t obvious this one had a happy ending.“I got on the train and he was standing on the platform. And I remember looking out the train, and I was so sad,” she says.As the train pulled away from the station, Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York.“I just met my future husband in Florence,” she wrote. “That’s the guy I’m gonna marry. I’m never gonna see him again.”Her friend tried to cheer her up.“You’re going to Rome,” she wrote. “You’ll meet a gladiator!”But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn’t replaceable.“We never stopped talking. We FaceTimed every single day,” she says.This continued when Kacie was back in the US. And before long, Dario was planning a trip to visit New York.On December 8, 2018 Dario arrived in the US. Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York.“It was really cool to see it through his eyes,” she says.“She showed me the real city,” says Dario.Then the couple flew to Miami for a week’s vacation.For Kacie and Dario, there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship.“It was never a decision to be made,” says Kacie.“It just went without saying,” agrees Dario. “But I can’t hide it, long distance was hard.”The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime, but tried to visit each other whenever they could.Cut to September 2019. Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie.“Why don’t I move here?” he suggested. He’d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get-go and could see himself there. The restaurant scene was incredible. If he could find a job and organize the visa, it seemed like the ideal scenario.Kacie thought so too, so Dario started asking around. He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. After a couple of months in limbo, his visa was approved.“Up until that point, every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic – we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other,” says Kacie. “Saying goodbye in airports sucked. It would take like a week to recover.”But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past.“It was really exciting,” says Dario.Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together, giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city.Then the pandemic hit. New York City’s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt. Stuck at home, Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another.As Kacie puts it, she and Dario found “many silver linings” in this tough time. Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta. They cat-sat. They spent long evenings chatting.But as 2020 rolled on, the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them. Dario’s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic, renewal was out of the question.For Kacie and Dario, it seemed like there were only three viable choices: return to long distance, get married or move to Italy.Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes, the last thing either of them wanted. And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future, they didn’t feel it was right for them at that point. That left moving to Italy.Kacie thought about her career in New York. Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight. And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing, Kacie only felt “relief” that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty.“That was a pretty big wake-up call,” she says. “I had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing.”On top of this, Kacie’s New York apartment lease was up. If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy, it was now.“Everything kind of fell into place,” she says.Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas. She applied, enrolling in Italian lessons. Then, Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic.Before stepping on the plane in January 2021, Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy. She’d never posted much on the platform before, but felt inspired to mark this significant life step.When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi-Fi, her cell phone was blowing up.“It went viral,” says Kacie.While stuck inside during mandatory two-week quarantine, Kacie continued posting TikTok videos. Her following continued to grow.While her social media presence was getting bigger, for the first few months in Florence, Kacie and Dario’s IRL world remained small. Italy was still in the thrall of Covid, with strict restrictions.But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work, Florence started to slowly reopen.“I remember the first time going to the Duomo. And there was nobody there,” says Kacie. “Which is crazy, because it’s like the main focus point of Florence. And there’s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was.”While that moment was surreal – even sad – Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together. They’d come a long way, and they were excited for their new life together in Italy.Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario’s family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly – even if, in the early days, Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario’s mother didn’t know much English.The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones.“They bonded immediately,” says Dario.Kacie continued to post on social media, and her following ballooned. After about six months, she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time.Dario encouraged this step.“I think it was a really good idea diving into it,” he says today. “It was the right moment, the right time, and I believed in her from the first moment.”Almost four years later, Kacie’s expanded her social media presence into a travel company, running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides. Meanwhile, Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant.“I really love the life we’ve created here,” says Kacie. “We live in a beautiful place with great food and he’s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me.”The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors, but they also savor their downtime. They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together.Dario and Kacie are settled in Florence for now, although they don’t rule out a move elsewhere in the future.“We’re enjoying the moment,” says Dario.“The solid thing is the fact that we know we’re in it together. And that’s what makes it so great,” says Kacie.She tells Dario: “I’m not nervous for what the future holds. Because I’ve got you.”Looking back, Kacie finds it serendipitous and surreal to think her spontaneous decision to travel solo in Italy led her to find a new career, a new home and the love of her life.“There were so many things that had to happen for it to actually happen, but it just felt normal and natural – like of course this is right and this was supposed to happen,” she says.“You never really know what life has planned for you. There’s so many good things waiting. You just have to trust it,” adds Kacie. “Trust in the process. And the path that is meant for you will happen, even if it’s not the path that you intended to take for yourself.”"

        "title": "How this beautiful Spanish tourist city became the green capital of Europe",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Valencia has long been one of Spain’s sunniest cities, thanks to its prime location on the Mediterranean. Now, it can also claim to be the most sustainable after winning the coveted Green Capital of Europe title.The European Commission cited Valencia’s 5 million square meters of green space. According to the Commission’s Report, 97% of residents live less than 300 meters from a major green area. Whether that’s the popular wide sandy beaches of the Mediterranean or the marshy lagoon of the Albufera where Valencia’s paella rice is grown.The Green Capital title is given annually to a city in Europe that sets an environmental example for others to follow. The European Commission awards 600,000 euros ($656,000) to the winner to fund more sustainable programs. The real prize, however, is the marketing boost that comes with a city’s certified green credentials. Previous winners have included Tallinn, Estonia, and Oslo, Norway, among others.“I think it’s a recognition by the European Community of our common work,” says Paola Llobet, Valencia’s councilor for tourism and innovation. “It’s something that we, as a community, have been building for years, within neighborhoods. We have been protecting our orchards, our beaches, our sea, the Albufera natural park and more.”Would-be visitors need only to look at a map of the city to see the most striking example of Valencia’s green spaces: the Turia Nature Park, a nine-kilometer-long converted riverbed that cuts through the city.After a deadly flood in 1957, the river was redirected and the Turia was slated to become a multi-lane highway. Public opposition thwarted the development, however, giving rise to a movement that demanded more green space in the city center.Today, the Turia has become a treasured communal space: a green ribbon that connects the fruit orchards on the outskirts to the Mediterranean Sea. Weekends are filled with soccer, rugby and baseball games at one of the many sports facilities in the park. On a sunny day, families picnic under groves of baobab and cypress trees while rock climbers and amateur acrobats try their skills at clambering up or spiraling down some of the medieval stone bridges that still span the park.It is also home to the City of Arts and Sciences, the futuristic masterpiece of Valencian architect, Santiago Calatrava – now one of the city’s biggest attractions. Its bright white curves and skeletal supports give it a space-age design, making it a favorite shooting location for science fiction films and series, from “Star Wars” to “Westworld.”The Turia also functions as a sustainable transportation highway. Designated paths run along the length of the park making it ideal for commuters on bicycles and electric scooters to cut through the city and avoid street traffic.A love of cycling is what led Giuseppe Grezzi, an Italian transplant to Valencia, to get involved in local politics, eventually becoming the city’s councillor of sustainable mobility for eight years. His proudest achievement: increasing bike lanes in the city by more than 50%.“The city is flat. The weather is perfect! I wanted to be able to bike everywhere,” he said after attending a community meeting to discuss Valencia’s Green Capital status. “We transformed the city. I was proud to be part of it. We put in so many policies to protect public space, to make the city greener, with more pedestrian areas and to reduce pollution.”During his term, the city poured money into sustainable transport, expanding a new metro line, installing public bicycles and augmenting nearly 200 kilometers (120 miles) of bike paths that link to several “green routes” out of the city.During the pandemic, Valencia took the initiative to convert several high-traffic areas into pedestrian-only zones, including the city’s central roundabout, where Valencia’s City Hall, the Ayuntamiento, sits in an impressive 18th-century building.The other benefit of all that green is Valencia’s bounty of fruits and vegetables. The city is surrounded by La Huerta, more than 120 square kilometers of fruit orchards and vegetable plots whose produce is sold at Valencia’s municipal markets. The European Commission singled out the city’s neighborhood and food program as it pushes for Zero Kilometer food, a movement that advocates growing and processing food in the same place where it is sold and eaten in order to reduce transport costs and carbon emissions.Valencia’s Mercado Central is a good place to see that in action. Nearly 300 hundred fruit, vegetable, fish and meat vendors sell their wares in a huge modernist hall. The day begins before dawn, when hundreds of vehicles begin to unload fresh produce from the surrounding area, including bushels of Valencia’s famous oranges.Though it has become a popular tourist attraction, the Mercado Central is still used by locals. Roughly 80% of customers are local residents, according to the market.That includes a growing number of Michelin-starred restaurants in the city. In 2005, chef Begoña Rodrigo started her restaurant, La Salita, to showcase the local ingredients of the Valencian region. By 2019, Rodrigo won a Michelin star for her innovative menu that “elevates the cooking of vegetables to new heights.”There are still major environmental challenges ahead for the city, however. Not least of which is the shifting political environment.Valencia’s Green Capital proposal was initiated under the city’s previous administration, a coalition of left-leaning parties known as Compromis. Elections in 2023, swept into power a coalition between the center-right Popular Party (PP), and the far-right Vox, a party that has denied the existence of climate change.That worries Giuseppe Grezzi, the former councilor of sustainable mobility.“A lot of our projects have simply stopped. Many are now paralyzed by the current administration,” he said. “So, we are very worried about it, whether it will be continued. Because this strategy should not be partisan, not just attached to one party. All the city must be involved in it.”Paola Llobet, the current councilor of tourism and innovation says that while some projects are being reassessed, the current administration is still committed to achieving sustainability goals.“Maybe we have a different way of arriving at our goals, different public policies,” she said. “But the goal is still the same: to have a sustainable city and a better quality of life for the people who live here and the people who come here to visit us.”One flash point is Valencia’s commercial port and cruise terminal. A proposal to expand the port is under consideration, potentially bringing in tens of thousands of new tourists a year. The current administration is also exploring the possibility of adding new direct flights from the US to Valencia’s International Airport.Cities like Barcelona and Venice, however, have struggled to cope with the sheer number of tourists arriving. Even for those working in tourism there is concern that Valencia could suffer the same fate.“If they can put a limit on tourism, whether by cruise ship or plane, that may be necessary to have a cut-off,” one tour guide, who declined to be named, told CNN Travel. “I worry that at some point, the numbers become unsustainable.”For Llobet, that means using technology to ease the impact of tourism on Valencia. She has started a project to produce “heat maps” of the city that tourists and guides can use to show which areas are more congested, suggesting alternative routes and to encourage tourists to visit other sites in the city.“We have a lot of data. We are measuring air pollution; sound pollution and we are starting a project on carbon emissions.” Llobet said, “We want the impact of the tourists to be positive. You know, 70% of the employment in the city depends on the service sector that is absolutely linked with the tourists.”Perhaps the most visible environmental challenge is Valencia’s Fallas tradition, a springtime riot of noise, color and pageantry that carries a heavy environmental toll. Tens of thousands flock to the city every March to participate in a succession of elaborate parades and firework extravaganzas. Giant colorful statues are displayed in neighborhoods across the city, then set alight at the climactic end of the festival. The result is often plumes of black smoke from burning polystyrene and petroleum-based products.This year, in honor of its Green Capital status, Valencia is celebrating its first ever “Green Fallas,” providing funding for neighborhoods to build with environmentally friendly alternatives such as paper maché, wood and rice-stalks. The aim is to celebrate Fallas with entirely sustainable materials by 2030.This year, the Fallas centerpiece is a giant two-story statue now being built in front of City Hall called “2 Doves, 1 Branch.” An appeal for peace depicts a pair of white doves carrying an olive branch. The structure is built from wood, papier-mâché and Neops, a foamy alternative to polystyrene made from plant residue, such as waste from processing wheat and cereal grains.Still, it’s hard to put environmental limits on cherished traditions. After the interview, Llobet invited CNN Travel to the main balcony of City Hall to view the “mascletà,” a daily fireworks display during the first 19 days of the festival. Each day it’s hosted by a different Valencian neighborhood community, known as a “fallero.”Just before two in the afternoon, a group of specially selected “fallera,” young women and girls in elaborate traditional dress, accompanied the mayor to signal the start of the mascletà.After a single shot comes a steady volley of bangs, followed by the zipping scream of fireworks exploding into white stars, barely visible against the blue sky. What was visible, however, were billowing clouds of smoke. As local broadcasters on the balcony breathlessly explained, the art of the mascletà is not the light show but the rhythm and crescendo of sound, culminating in a deafening barrage of thrilling, thunderous noise and smoke.Llobet concedes it’s hard to make Fallas a truly green event, but they are aiming to make it a more sustainable tradition.“We are working with different ‘falleros’ to be better with the use of plastic and waste, the use of water. Every year, we try and improve it a bit more,” she said. “But we have more than 100,000 ‘falleros’ in the city. One in every plaza or square. So, really, it’s a way of life.”"

        "title": "There’s a US border on Irish soil. Here’s why",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Long lines. Feeling bleary-eyed and exhausted after an overnight flight. Scrambling to get your documents ready.For most international travelers arriving in the US, going through immigration and customs is another step in the travel process – and it can take a little while.But international travelers arriving from a select group of airports, including Ireland’s Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport, step off the plane and breeze through domestic arrivals, whether they’re US passport holders or not.That’s because Dublin and Shannon Airport are two of the 15 airports across the globe that offer US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) preclearance, allowing all travelers to go through US immigration and customs before they board a plane heading stateside. That means upon arrival on US soil, travelers bypass CBP and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) inspections.Preclearance has been around for decades, but unless travelers happen to transit through one of the airports where it’s offered, it’s not necessarily on their radar. Nor do they necessarily realize that international preclearance facilities are staffed by US border force officials – not local airport workers.In fact, CBP has more than 600 officers and agriculture specialists stationed at 15 airports hubs across six countries: Dublin and Shannon in Ireland; Aruba; Bermuda; Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates; Nassau in the Bahamas; and Calgary, Toronto, Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver, Victoria and Winnipeg in Canada.Here’s how US preclearance works, and what it’s like for the American citizens who move from the US to Ireland to work the border abroad.Travelers transiting through airports offering US CBP preclearance begin by checking in and going through security, as they would at any other airport. But rather than subsequently browsing duty free or grabbing some food, they head to preclearance and go through US border inspection there and then.Travelers transiting through airports offering US preclearance can’t opt out, but officials suggest the only disadvantage of preclearance for travelers is the need to factor it into airport arrival times.But lines at preclearance are generally shorter than those experienced by US arrivals on US soil – because generally speaking, fewer people are being processed at any one time.Niall Kearns, airport director at Ireland’s Shannon Airport, tells CNN Travel preclearance “can save you hours.”“I think people have maybe had previous experience of going to the States and just being stuck in immigration lines for a long time,” says Kearns. “But you can get all this done in a very hassle-free, quick manner in Shannon and then arrive in New York or Boston or Chicago.”Plus, CBP recently introduced a mobile passport control app, which allows travelers to begin the process of preclearance before they even arrive at the airport. The app’s now in use at Shannon and Dublin airports.The goal is the app will speed everything up, says Robert Murray, an assistant director who oversees preclearance operations from his base in the US.“People are not always prepared for being inspected when they come through a preclearance location, because they’re kind of taken by surprise by it,” Murray tells CNN Travel.“Because of the timelines that we face with trying to make sure people are getting to their flights, we really wanted to push the use of mobile passport control and people downloading the app and being ready for their inspection a little bit sooner.”US preclearance is arranged via a legal treaty – a formal agreement signed between nations. That treaty stipulates that American officials can conduct their full immigration inspection in the host country.One notable difference is US CBP officers working in Ireland are unarmed, in line with Irish law.Murray – who worked as a preclearance border officer in Dublin, Ireland for six years before taking on his current role – explains that if anyone is, for example, pulled over for extra checks during preclearance, US CBP officials “will complete the inspections that we’re working on to the logical conclusion that we would in the States.”If they decide the individual isn’t fit to fly, they return them to local immigration officials, “which is no different really, then it would be if you were stateside, except that we just happen to be in the same building,” explains Murray, adding it’s “a much quicker process, and obviously less consequential to the person, which is a nice benefit of preclearance.”In 2014, then-secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, praised preclearance by using an American football metaphor: “I’d much rather defend our end-zone from the 50-yard line than from our one-yard line,” he said. “I want to take every opportunity we have to expand homeland security beyond our borders.”Murray also suggests screening travelers before they board a flight to the US is smart from a US security perspective.“I think anytime that we have an opportunity to speak to someone, to do a full inspection on someone, before they board a flight bound to the US – I think that that’s advantageous for all parties involved,” he says. “For safety and security, being able to stop persons from boarding a flight that shouldn’t be on a flight, and make sure that people that should be on the flight are safe – I think it’s always advantageous to do that before.”While many travelers enjoy the ease offered by preclearance, the program isn’t without its controversies.In 2017, for example, in response to then-President Trump’s travel ban on Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, the Irish government ordered a “complete review” of the preclearance system. However the system remained unchanged following the review.Preclearance was originally called pre-inspection, and dates back to 1903, when it was first offered for passengers sailing from Victoria, Canada to the American Pacific Northwest.In the 1950s, as commercial aviation took off, pre-inspection became preclearance. Ireland became the first country outside of North America to offer the program in the 1980s, at Shannon Airport. Dublin Airport followed suit in the 1990s.Murray suggests “the already existing long history of diplomatic relations certainly fostered them choosing Ireland as the first location outside of North America for preclearance.”He stresses that establishing preclearance abroad is “not a US alone decision.”“The US has to do an evaluation of any location and determine if there is a security benefit for us to go,” he explains. “But at the same time, the host nation also has to see a benefit in having us come.”The CBP has certain design standards that are required for preclearance hubs. In some cases, airports can refurbish existing facilities. Other times new facilities may be built.Shannon Airport’s Niall Kearns says this involves host airports “investing significantly.” But preclearance is good for airport business, he adds – especially at Shannon, which also offers preclearance for private jet travelers, as well as commercial travelers.This commercial benefit is often the impetus for host airports signing preclearance facilities. Kearns says Shannon Airport is proud to offer preclearance, and hopes it helps attract airlines and passengers to choose to transit through their aviation hub.While establishing preclearance facilities involves collaboration from the US and the host country, every preclearance facility is staffed entirely by American nationals.Murray says that while locals he met in Ireland tended to be aware of the US CBP presence there, people from elsewhere in the world were often confused when they heard American accents at the Dublin Airport facility.“I think one of the biggest misconceptions is that we are Irish, and that we work for the Irish government,” he says.Of course, some CBP officials may be dual nationalities – but they are also “all American citizens, all full fledged law enforcement officers working for the US government overseas,” explains Murray.So how does the US staff international preclearance locations?Murray says preclearance jobs and other international postings are available to CBP officers via an open application process – CBP personnel aren’t stationed at preclearance locations abroad unless they want to be.“For all of our preclearance locations, the people that are going to these locations, are people that have applied to go there,” explains Murray.For Murray’s part, he worked as a CBP officer in the US for several years before he took a preclearance job in Abu Dhabi. Working in the UAE gave Murray “a taste of what the experience of being in preclearance was like, and I really enjoyed it.”“And so being in Europe and working in a preclearance location was really desirable for me,” he explains.Murray applied to work in Dublin in 2015 and moved to Ireland the following year.“I actually arrived at St. Patrick’s Day of 2016. It was a very long day, as you can imagine, I was very tired,” says Murray, adding that he “didn’t really get much out of the experience” of the Irish holiday that first year.But over his six years living and working in Dublin, Murray enjoyed getting involved in local holidays, embracing traditions and generally getting to know the city, and country, where he was living.“One example is I made a personal choice to join a gym where I knew none of my colleagues were,” Murray says, explaining he wanted to force himself “outside of the comfort zone to meet new people, specifically in the community.”He also enjoyed taking advantage of Dublin’s easy proximity to the rest of Europe.“You have your base in Ireland and you can travel anywhere that you want to within Ireland but then you also have the airport available for quick easy access to other places in Europe,” he says.Murray says living abroad was an “amazing” opportunity, but says there are also – as with any job that involves relocating – some challenges.While many CBP officials relocate with their families, Murray moved solo.“For the amazing experience it is that the government gives us – the great experience it is especially working in Ireland – it is a definitely a commitment and an adjustment for a lot of people,” Murray says, explaining you “go from a situation where you’re surrounded by your family, or you have close friends and family, to going to a place where you might not know anybody.”But the CBP officials stationed abroad look out for each other, Murray adds.“You do kind of become reliant on each other. You watch out for each other, look out for each other,” he says, adding this extends beyond the airport to the “larger embassy community.”Officers moving to Dublin are assisted with finding accommodation by the local embassy, whereas officers moving to Shannon must make their own living arrangements. Instead, colleagues will offer each other tips and tricks on where to live.From his position at Shannon Airport, airport manager Kearns enjoys seeing how the US airport workers adapt to their new home.“It’s really been great to see how they settle into local communities around County Clare and around County Limerick,” says Kearns. “I know from speaking to some of them, they love spending their time off going hiking, or going visiting different cities and exploring the Wild Atlantic Way while they’re here.”American CBP officials are permitted to spend a maximum of six years working abroad at preclearance locations before they must return to the US.Murray worked in Ireland for that full duration. And his current job might be based stateside, but he regularly checks in with his colleagues abroad – his present role involves helping “make the lives and the experience overall for the employees overseas” smooth.And as well as maintaining work links in Dublin and Shannon, Murray returned to Ireland last summer for a vacation.“I have a number of friends that I’ve remained in contact with over there,” he says.Overall, Murray says he enjoyed working in Dublin because it gave him “a much more expanded worldview of how other people think and how other people live.”"

        "title": "Passenger on Boeing flight that suddenly dropped says pilot told him he lost control after instrument failure",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "The pilot of a terrifying flight from Australia to New Zealand told those on board he temporarily lost control of his Boeing 787 after one of its instruments failed, a passenger said Monday, as authorities investigate what caused a sudden drop that threw travelers around the cabin, injuring dozens.In accordance with rules outlined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Chile’s Directorate General of Civil Aeronautics (DGAC) have sent investigators from the agency’s Operations and Airworthiness team to look into the incident, according to a statement released on Tuesday.“Given that the State of Registration of the aircraft involved is Chilean, it has been established with the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) that the investigation will be carried out by the Chilean Aeronautical Authority,” the statement read.The incident aboard LATAM Airlines flight 800 from Sydney to Auckland is the latest to hit troubled aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which has been rocked by years of quality and safety issues.Passenger Brian Jokat described the horrifying moment when he was woken from his sleep as the aircraft “dropped something to the effect of 500 feet instantly.”“That’s when I opened my eyes and there was various individuals at the top of the plane. Just stuck to the roof and then they fell to the floor. And then I just realized I’m not in a movie, this is actually for real,” he told CNN’s Erin Burnett.After landing in Auckland, Jokat said the pilot checked on the passengers and explained he had temporarily lost control of the jet.“I immediately engaged with him and said, ‘What was that?’ And he openly admitted, he said, ‘I lost control of the plane. My gauges just kind of went blank on me,’” Jokat said.“He said for that brief moment he couldn’t control anything and that’s when the plane did what it did. Then he said the gauges came back and it reengaged, the plane just reengaged to its normal flight pattern. And we had no issues before, no issues after. But just that moment.”The plane, operated by Chile’s flag carrier, was a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.LATAM on Monday said the plane “had a technical event during the flight which caused a strong movement,” adding it had landed as scheduled in Auckland.In a statement to CNN Tuesday, Boeing said it was “working to gather more information about the flight and will provide any support needed by our customer.”About 50 people were injured in the incident, with one person in serious condition, emergency services said.Jokat said he feared for his life when he saw fellow passengers fly out of their seats and hit the ceiling of the plane.“People were screaming and crying. And yeah, it was mass chaos for a few short seconds,” he said. “Clearly there was a moment in my head that I just kind of resigned to the fact this could be it. This might be it.”As investigators scramble to discover what might have caused the sudden drop, the incident comes at a fraught time for Boeing.The US manufacturer has faced harsh criticism for a series of quality and safety issues in recent years, with many critics saying the company has shifted its focus in the last few decades to financial results at the cost of safety and quality in its aircraft.They include two fatal crashes of the 737 Max jet due to a design flaw in the plane, numerous halts in deliveries due to quality control issues and, most recently, a door plug that blew off of a new 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines in January, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane.Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration in February flagged safety issues with engine anti-ice systems on the 737 Max and larger 787 Dreamliner.The safety regulator continues to allow both models of the plane to fly despite the potential problems. Both issues are moving through the FAA’s standard process for developing airworthiness directives — rather than an emergency process — signaling that the agency and plane maker do not believe the issues are serious enough to require the planes to stop flying immediately.The FAA said Monday it has given Boeing until late May to produce a plan to remedy issues identified in a federal audit and other reviews, including a safety culture survey of employees and a separate panel report that found workers concerned about retaliation for reporting safety concerns.FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said he expects the company to produce “a very detailed plan within the next 90 days to fix the quality issues that are out there.”Boeing has said it is working on several of the issues Whitaker identified."

        "text": "You’ll no doubt be hungry after watching “Eva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.”Every episode is full of mouthwatering regional specialties prepared by chefs all over the country.For those wanting to follow in Eva Longoria’s footsteps, below is a guide to the restaurants and locations she visited.Longoria visits the coastal state of Veracuz. Its position along some 400 miles (645 kilometers) of the Caribbean Sea made it a focal point for military conflict – and the collision of food cultures. “The people of Veracruz took this treasure trove of ingredients passing in and out of the port and created a whole new cuisine,” Longoria said.• Longoria met chef Erik Guerrero, who aims to make fishing more sustainable in Veracruz, at Namik restaurant, where they enjoyed ceviche with hot beans and soft shell crab taco.• Next up, she joined actor and friend Ana de la Reguera for some coffee at historic Café La Parroquia, Veracruz Port. Tap on the glass three times to ring for milk.• She headed to the lush inland mountains to meet coffee farming expert Itzel Mendoza at Cafetal Privado en Coetzala to learn how the precious bean is grown. There, they gathered flowers in the fields to be added to chicken stew, a salsa and a palm flower fritter.• Back in Veracruz Port, she met food historian Nidia Hernández Medel at Chuchumbé, a cultural center, to cook some fried yucca, which is traced back to the city’s African slave era.• It’s back out of the city to meet with vanilla farmer Norma Gaya, of Gaya Vanilla and Spices, for some vanilla chicken.• At El Tajin ruins, a Totonac settlement, Longoria met cook Doña Marta. She’s the founder of Smoke Women, which keeps ancient Totonac traditions alive. They enjoyed alcamaya (fresh-water shrimp) stew and mushroom empanadas.• Chef Luis Palmeros, a rising star on the Mexican food scene, introduces Longoria to traditional cook Doña Rocio at Cuarto Blanco Market in the inland city of Xalapa (the capital of Veracruz state), for a traditional stuffed jalapeño. He then takes Longoria to his restaurant, El Cuarto Blanco, for his modern take on the dish.• At Tortas Ahogadas El Príncipe Heredero in Guadalajara, Longoria samples a torta ahogada – the region’s beloved “drowned” sandwich.• In Guadalajara’s Santa Teresita neighborhood, Longoria samples a new preparation of native ingredient chinchayote at Xokol, a restaurant run by chefs Óscar Segundo and Xrysw Ruelas Díaz.• Longoria attends a charreada, a Mexican rodeo, that takes place at Lienzo Charro Charros De Jalisco. Afterward, she sampled birria, the celebrated goat stew from Jalisco, at the clubhouse.• Chef Fabian Delgado Padilla treats Longoria to mole with pork belly at his restaurant palReal in Guadlajara’s Colonia Americana neighborhood.• At Lake Chapala, about 30 miles south of Guadalajara, Longoria meets with members of one of the oldest indigenous groups in Mexico, the Coca people, to talk about their fight to preserve their way of life and history on the lake. They feast on local fish called charales.• Longoria meets friends Mariana Padilla and Alejandra Pelayo at traditional cantina La Iberia in Guadalajara. Women weren’t allowed in cantinas until the 1980s, Longoria said.• Then she heads to to the town of Tequila, where Salvador Rosales Trejo shows her how tequila is produced by Tequila Cascahuin using traditional methods.• Longoria and chef Fabian Delgado Padilla visit Yunaites, his casual restaurant inside a municipal market in Guadalajara, for gorditas topped with pork and mole.Say adios to vegetables for a while. Nuevo León is the land of meat. In this state in northeast Mexico, carne asada is a go-to meal. And it’s the cuisine Longoria grew up with in Texas.• In Monterrey, Longoria met up with Alejandro Gutiérrez, founder of the Mexican Society of Grill Masters, to try the region’s specialty: carne asada (grilled meat). In August, there’s a grill master competition in Santiago, outside of Monterrey.• Tacos Doña Mary La Gritona has been serving breakfast tacos in Monterrey for nearly 20 years. “These are the best tortillas I’ve ever had,” said Longoria.• El Jonuco restaurant celebrates the products of Nuevo León with a focus on seasonal ingredients. They’re known for their cabrito (roasted goat). The restaurant celebrates the little-known history of crypto-Judaism in the region, Longoria said.• Dona Lupita’s Café, located in the backyard of her home right next to Highway 85 south of Monterrey, is famed for its legendary tamales.• La Divinita bakery is one of the most successful bakery chains in Monterrey. The founder uses local oranges to make a traditional dessert with Longoria.• Koli restaurant, run by the three Rivera Rio brothers, is a fine dining restaurant that aims to tell the story of Nuevo León.Nestled within three vast mountain ranges, Oaxaca is a magnet for food lovers in the know.A thrill of any visit here is sampling the moles, as well as dishes such as tlayudas (thin Oaxacan “pizzas”), spicy hot chocolate and asado grilled in smoky market stalls. “It is on another level gastronomically, one of the best places I’ve been to in the world,” Longoria said.• Mercado de Abastos is a giant market on the edge of Oaxaca City. If you want your chocolate fix, the mercado is still the place to come. This region is known for its moles – complex sauces featuring many blended ingredients.• Casa Oaxaca makes Oaxaca’s famous mole negro drizzled over turkey breast. Longoria called it a magnificently complex and sophisticated sauce.• At Las Quince Letras, chef Celia Florián made Longoria quesillo – a stretched Oaxacan cheese -- with crickets and edible flowers.• In the area of Oaxaca located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, several muxes, who identify as a third gender and are guardians of Zapotecan cuisine, cooked up stuffed pork with pineapple served alongside pureed potatoes. Longoria called it “the perfect combination.”• The farming town of Santa Ana Zegache is the unassuming epicenter of corn. Corn has been worshipped for over 6,000 years and is still the beating heart of Mexican cuisine.• In San Baltazar Chichicapam, Longoria visited a palenque (agave farm) run by Doña Berta, one of very few female mezcaleras. The farm produces mezcal, the smoky liquor for which this region is famed.• La Cocina de Humo is a hip restaurant using local ingredients. Chef Thalia Barrios García is known for her heirloom tomato salad with beet puree and herbal dressing. Longoria said it’s the “perfect dish.” Here’s the recipe.Mayan DNA runs through the recipes in Yucatán, which has the largest Maya population in Mexico.The state is located along the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by dense forests that isolate it off from the rest of the country. The Maya thrived here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The region’s geography and turbulent history have had a significant impact on the cuisine.• Ixi’im mixes modern and ancestral techniques and flavors. The restaurant has its own version of the most famous dish from the Yucatán, cochinita pibil. Chef Luis Ronzón slow-cooks pork underground after it’s marinated in sour orange and spices.• Condimentos Enrique is a family-run business that sells recados (spice pastes) in Mercado de Santiago in Mérida.• At Huniik, which means “unique spirit” in Maya, chef Roberto Solís makes onion tempura with black recado. “I have never had anything like this. This is gorgeous, and it’s delicious,” said Longoria.• In his home in Xocén, chef Alberto Kuku prepared one of the oldest dishes, Mayan chicken tamales, for Hanal Pixán, a holiday celebrated by the Maya people that means “food for the souls.” The food honoring the dead “can easily be carried back to the underworld,” he said.• Chef Regina Escalante, who runs Merci in Mérida, showed Longoria how to make grilled seabass with mango, avocado and flor de sal. “I’d have this as my last meal on Earth,” said Longoria. Here’s the recipe.• At Uxmal, Mayan archaeologist Don Pepe cooked up smoked pork and bean stew. It cooks underground for 12 hours.• Kinich in Izamal is famous for its queso relleno. A key ingredient is, surprisingly, Dutch cheese. See how it’s made:“It’s crazy, it’s crowded, it’s noisy – and I love it!” Longoria said as she walked the streets of Mexico City, where she lives part-time with her family. This region was once the capital of the mighty Aztec empire, known as Tenochtitlán until the Spanish invaded about 500 years ago and changed its name to Mexico City.Here are the places Eva Longoria visited in the episode:• Tomasa is a Mexican bakery known for its conchas, a fluffy sweet bread with a crunchy topping.• El Huequito in the Historic Center serves up delicious al pastor tacos, which are a staple in Mexico City.• Tacos Los Alexis is sizzling hot in the taco world. Owner Alexis Ayala uses his five-star culinary training to transform traditional recipes from his childhood into to-die-for gourmet tacos.• Contramar in Roma, the bohemian part of town, is one of Longoria’s favorite restaurants. Owner and chef Gabriela Cámara made her signature dish: pescado a la talla.• Máximo Bistrot, a gourmet restaurant that marries French and Mexican cuisine, is run by chef Eduardo “Lalo” García. For Longoria, he made a roasted beet salad with rocket and wilted purslane. Best known as a weed, purslane is nonetheless edible and very nutritious.• Mercado de Jamaica is one of hundreds of markets in the city. At the street food stalls, Longoria tried green chorizo tacos and tlacoyos, thick oval-shaped tortillas typically stuffed with beans or cheese.• Casa Tochan refugee shelter is the first shelter for immigrants in Mexico City. The residents cook dishes from their homeland to share with their housemates.• El Moro is an institution famous for its churros and chocolate.• Hiyoko restaurant in Little Tokyo cooks up a Mexican-Japanese fusion.

        "title": "Man rescued after receiving apparent crocodile bite in the Everglades",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "A man trying to swim to shore after his recreational sailboat capsized at Everglades National Park suffered an apparent bite from an American crocodile, according to a National Park Service news release.Rangers responded around 4:43 p.m. Sunday to a report that the man was observed going under water at Flamingo Marina, located in southern part of the park near the open water of the Florida Straits.They were able to pull a 68-year-man out and treat a laceration on one of his legs, the release said.The rangers worked with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue to transport the patient to a hospital, and the patient was reported stable upon transfer to EMS providers, the release said.“Rangers and park biologists are continuing to investigate the incident and monitor the suspected crocodile, which is easily identifiable,” the release said.The American crocodile is a federally threatened species, the NPS said, and it resembles the American alligator. But they are different species in very different situations.There are only about 2,000 adult crocodiles in the mainland United States, living exclusively in a narrow range along the coastlines of central and southern Florida, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. (American crocodiles can also be found in some coastal areas of Caribbean islands, Mexico and South America.)Meanwhile, an estimated 5 million wild American alligators are spread out across 10 states in Southeast and beyond, including parts of North Carolina and even the extreme southeastern tip of Oklahoma.American crocodiles are considered a shy and reclusive species, the FFWCC says, and crocodile attacks on humans in Florida are very rare.Worldwide is a different matter – about 1,000 deaths a year are attributed to crocodile attacks in places such as Africa, mainland Asia, Indonesia and Australia."

        "title": "This train goes nowhere. Now it’s a luxury attraction",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "South Africa is home to some of the most luxurious, nostalgic train journeys on offer anywhere in the world. But for certain enthusiasts, a train going nowhere is the country’s star attraction.Kruger Shalati: The Train on the Bridge is a hotel in Skukuza in Kruger National Park, one of Africa’s largest game reserves and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Comprising a set of train carriages renovated into 24 modern suites with balconies and a pool overlooking the Sabie River, it marries luxury accommodation with an intimate view of wildlife, including sightings of Africa’s “Big Five” — lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalos.Jerry Mabena, CEO of Motsamayi Tourism Group, which owns the hotel, says the venture harks back to the earliest days of the park, when steam trains would pass through Kruger in the 1920s on the Selati Railway Line.Trains were once vital for tourists accessing Kruger, and would even park overnight on the same bridge where the hotel sits today. A new railway line built on the edge of Kruger in the 1970s pushed the Selati line and bridge into retirement, but in 2016 an idea was formed to restore the bridge to its former glory.“The idea for us was to re-enact the experience in some form or another,” Mabena says. “When we had the opportunity to buy mothballed old carriages from Transnet — which is our rail logistics operator in South Africa — we couldn’t say no to the idea.”The carriages’ interiors have been renovated with a modern finish, albeit with a few Art Deco flourishes (“we were trying to find a look that is non-colonial,” says Mabena).If guests leave their curtains open, they can wake with the dawn and catch the first signs of life outside from east-facing floor-to-ceiling windows. The river is a wildlife focal point, meaning guests can spend all day lounging on balconies or swimming in the pool while checking out activity below. “Having hippos grunting underneath the carriage attracts people who want to be in the wild but don’t want to be immersed in the wild,” says Mabena.Nevertheless, many visitors strap on boots and head into the bush with a guide on a game drive.Staff including senior guide Thuli Mnisi were recruited as part of efforts to involve the local community in the enterprise. Mnisi had worked as a guide for other companies since 2014 before joining Kruger Shalati. “(It’s) totally different from other lodges,” she says. “When (guests) visit the train for the first time, it’s breath-taking, the view is unique.”Kruger National Park allows self-driving safari experiences, but Mnisi says there’s no substitute for having a guide. “We communicate with one another, we know where we can find the animals,” she says.“If you’re (on) a self-drive, you can just wander around Kruger National Park, and it’s a very big area. If you go with a guide, they know what they’re doing, they know where to find what and exactly at what time.”Gardeners have planted indigenous species on the hotel grounds and nurture a kitchen garden, with produce used in Kruger Shalati’s fine dining restaurant. Local delicacies served in the refined setting include crocodile, venison, and springbok carpaccio.“Mother nature is the true artist,” says chef Vusi Mbatha. “It’s one of those philosophies that we share: take simple ingredients and transform them into something amazing.”After development delays courtesy of Covid-19, the hotel opened in December 2020 and is welcoming guests for its fourth summer season.Double and twin rooms aboard the train start at 9,950 Rand ($530) per person, per night for international guests, with discounts for longer stays. One of the seven rooms in the adjacent Bridge House cost less. Rates include all meals, certain drinks, two game drives and airport transfers.If all this sounds like too much wildlife and not enough trains, Motsamayi Tourism Group also owns Kruger Station, just south of the bridge and home to the last train to operate in the park.Stranded after most of the tracks in the park were removed in the 1970s, the South African Railway Class 24 steam locomotive has lived many lives (including a funeral coach for a former prime minister) and now enjoys a happy retirement alongside a restaurant and bar.“The culture of steam trains and the culture of historical trains I think is beginning to re-emerge,” says Mabena.“We don’t have a moving steam train, but one day, I think we will.”"

        "title": "French appetite for frogs’ legs threatens frog species, experts warn Macron",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "The popularity of the famous French delicacy of cuisses de grenouille, or frogs’ legs, is threatening the existence of certain frog species, a group of more than 500 environmental campaigners has warned French President Emmanuel Macron.In an open letter written to Macron earlier this month, organized by French nonprofits Robin des Bois and Vétérinaires pour la Biodiversité (Veterinarians for Biodiversity), and German charity Pro Wildlife, the 557 signatories said 4,070 tons of frozen frogs’ legs are imported into the European Union every year - equivalent to 80 million-200 million frogs, depending on the size of the species.A joint study by Robin des Bois and Pro Wildlife found that France alone consumes more than 3,000 tons of frozen frogs’ legs a year.The vast majority of these frogs come from wild populations in Indonesia, Turkey and Albania, the letter said, where some frog species are in significant decline. Vietnam is also a large exporter of frogs’ legs, but these frogs are typically farmed rather than wild, according to a media statement accompanying the letter.The 557 signatories to the letter, who work in the fields of research, nature conservation and veterinary medicine, suggested France should shoulder the responsibility of protecting frog species, given that it is the country that consumes the most frogs’ legs in the EU.According to the letter, recent studies have found that common species such as the crab-eating frog and the rice-field frog are in decline due to “intense commercial harvests and exports for many years.”Though frog populations native to the EU are protected against “commercial exploitation” under the Habitats Directive, the letter says, this protection does not extend to species imported into the region.“It’s absurd: the natural frog populations here in Europe are protected under EU law,” Sandra Altherr, head of science at Pro Wildlife, said in the media statement. “But the EU still tolerates the collection of millions of animals in other countries – even if this threatens the frog populations there. This is not at all in line with the EU’s recent biodiversity strategy.”Alain Moussu, president of Veterinarians for Biodiversity, said vets joined this initiative because “they are both sensitive to the cruelty that prevails in this market and concerned about the ecological imbalances caused by the collapse of amphibian populations.” One of these imbalances, Moussu suggested, is an increase in mosquito populations, which could have a knock-on effect on human health.The signatories called on France to develop proposals to protect declining frog species, and to ensure that the monitoring, regulation and sustainability of the trade in frogs’ legs is governed by international trade rules.CNN has reached out to the Élysée Palace for comment."

        "title": "There’s a luxury campsite in the middle of the Qatar desert. Here’s what it’s like",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "For miles on end, there is nothing but huge swathes of desert and the burning blue of the sky. In this corner of southeastern Qatar, nestled within the stunning Inland Sea nature reserve, the silence is only broken by the soft rustling of the wind and maybe the hum of a pack of 4X4s bashing the dunes in the distance.It’s in this serene setting that The Outpost Al Barari, a tented villa desert retreat, opened its doors a little over a year ago coinciding with the hosting of the World Cup by Qatar.This luxury escape from the hustle of downtown Doha is one of several premium desert stays available in the Middle Eastern country, which is hoping to capitalize on its global exposure during the world’s biggest soccer tournament and encourage tourists seeking a guaranteed sunshine destination.Qatar already has other places to stay in its epic sea of sand. The Hilton Salwa Resort, one of the largest resort complexes in the Middle East, appeared in 2021, complete with its own theme park, on a remote shoreline close to the border with Saudi Arabia.But while Salwa appears to be the size of a small town, the diminutive tented camp of Al Barari – as its name suggests – feels like an outpost.Desert camping is a popular pastime in Qatar, with many locals enjoying canvas escapes at weekends or during festivals. These range from simple setups to lavish encampments with all mod cons. Al Barari is definitely in the latter group.Stepping into the resort feels as if you have stumbled upon a little oasis in the wilderness.There are 21 tented suites of varying sizes ranging from 38 square meters to up to 150 square meters, with rates typically starting at about $300 per night.This is a world away from glamping though.Modern and comfortable, each living space is designed to offer guests seclusion and luxury – case in point, most come with their own private swimming pools.The jewel in the crown is undoubtedly The Emiri Villa, which stands out with its three bedrooms and the separate living and dining room. Ideal for families, it comes with a large pool on a spacious terrace surrounded by sunbeds and swings. A night here will set you back about $1,500.Mohammad Taha Nashwan, general manager of The Outpost Al Barari, tells CNN it took about two years to build the resort, which is located some 66 kilometers (41 miles) south of Hamad International Airport, Qatar’s main entry point and travel hub.Nashwan says the goal was to create an experience that appealed to both locals and foreign visitors alike by combining “luxury hospitality with maximum privacy” and offering a stay that would “celebrate Qatar’s rich natural environment and heritage.”Indeed, it is this opportunity to explore the spectacular nearby surroundings and reconnect with nature that is a major drawing point for The Outpost Al Barari.Guests can enjoy desert safaris to the Inland Sea, a popular tidal inlet further south straddling the border with Saudi Arabia.Additionally, they can opt for a guided nature walk up and down the dunes and beyond to learn more about the wildlife roaming the desert – from spiny-tailed lizards and desert foxes to ospreys and long-distance migrant waterfowls.Fitness-minded visitors can also enrol for personalized yoga and workout sessions on the sandy slopes, complemented by a three-day nutrition and personal wellbeing plan.There are also the fun options of sand surfing, fat biking and camel riding. For the more adventurous, there are hot air balloon rides to take in the magnificent views in every direction – a wavy blanket of sand stretching out to the horizon, interrupted only by the abrupt crash of the golden dunes into the turquoise sea.During winter months, the outpost’s elegant and airy setting is also a popular hangout spot for Qatari campers who escape the commotion of Doha by returning to the desert for a weekend getaway.Visitor Hasan Al Naimi described staying at Al Barari as an “adventure” that allows you to “experience the Arabic way in the desert” – but “in a fancy way.”“You enjoy the golden dunes view around the resort while you are swimming in the private pool,” the 47-year-old tells CNN.“It looks like an oasis,” he says.Sometimes Al Barari works hard to make guests forget they’re in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by sand in every direction. There are cream scones, Arabic coffee and Cuban cigars on hand. There’s also a Spa Tent offering invigorating massages and a big communal pool that feels a world away from the arid surroundings.The resort’s main restaurant offers an eclectic four-course menu blending Mediterranean and Middle Eastern offerings with Indian influences. Diners can either eat indoors or under the stars, with low lighting and an open fireplace for a more romantic feel.Yet, the ultimate highlight may well be the nearby outdoor cinema screening classic films. Here, guests can watch a favorite movie beneath the desert night sky, while lounging by a fire pit in a cozy area strewn with traditional rugs and handwoven pillows.Getting to The Outpost Al Barari from Doha is about an hour’s drive in an SUV. Guests can either head to the resort themselves or use its transport service and get picked up at Al Meera, on Sealine Beach. Travelers flying into the Qatari capital can also arrange an airport transfer for additional charges."

        "title": "Galapagos Islands to double tourist entry fees amid concerns over rising visitor numbers",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Tourists to the Galapagos Islands will be asked to pay twice as much in entry fees from this year amid concerns that a rise in visitor numbers is putting pressure on the ecologically sensitive destination.Ecuador’s Ministry of Tourism has announced the new fees, which will take effect on August 1, 2024.The entry fee will go from $100 to $200 for nationals of almost all countries, except for other members of the South American trade bloc Mercosur, which includes Argentina, Brazil, and Peru.Mercosur members will now have to pay $100 per person, up from $50. Children under age two can visit for free, regardless of nationality.This is the first increase in Galapagos entry fees since 1998.“The Galapagos Islands are not only a national treasure but a global one. It is our collective responsibility to protect and preserve this unparalleled ecosystem for future generations,” Niels Olsen, Ecuador’s tourism minister, said in a statement shared with the Galapagos Conservation Trust.Olsen added that the additional money will go toward conservation efforts for the islands, which are 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) off the coast of mainland Ecuador.The Galapagos are a UNESCO World Heritage site comprised of more than 100 islands. The islands, nicknamed a “living museum,” are home to many rare or endangered plants and animals.Only some 30,000 people live on one of the Galapagos islands, but about 170,000 tourists visit in a typical year.The Galapagos Conservation Trust, a UK-registered charity focused on promoting conservation and sustainability on the islands, has warned of ecological consequences from rising visitor numbers.“Recent years have seen worrying growth in the number of visitors to the Islands, driven by a sharp increase in land-based tourism,” it said on its website.“This is pushing waste management systems to the limit, exacerbating water and food insecurity, and increasing the threat of devastating invasive species being introduced to the Islands.”Scientific discoveries continue to be made in the archipelago. A previously unknown coral reef, believed to be thousands of years old, was discovered by scientists last year.In 2021, UNESCO issued a report on the islands and the state of conservation efforts there. The report commended the Ecuadorean government for reducing illegal fishing and controlling the spread of invasive species but had requested an update by 2024.The destination’s global profile could be raised this year by a new movie, directed by Ron Howard, exploring a true-life story of scandal, sexual liberation and murder which unraveled on a Galapagos island in the 1930s. “Eden,” to be released later this year, is set to star Sydney Sweeney, Vanessa Kirby, Ana de Armas and Jude Law."

        "text": "Concorde, the world’s fastest commercial aircraft, has been making a rare journey – floating down New York’s Hudson River.The British Airways Concorde, one of only 20 of the supersonic aircraft to ever fly, has been en route back to NYC’s Intrepid Museum after being sanded and recoated during several months of restoration.The delta-wing jet, which has been a hallmark of the aviation and maritime museum since 2003, made its way along the river aboard a barge, with an overnight stop in Jersey City, New Jersey.It was due to be unloaded by crane early on Thursday at the river’s Pier 86, with the event streamed live on the museum’s social media.Intrepid says its Concorde holds the world speed record for a passenger aircraft, having reached 1,354 miles per hour – more than twice the speed of sound – flying New York to London in 2 hours, 52 minutes and 59 seconds in 1996.The aircraft, call sign G-BOAD, first took to the skies in 1976 and once flew a service operated jointly by British Airways and Singapore Airlines, uniquely wearing the liveries of both carriers for a time, according to HeritageConcorde.comIt made its last flight in 2003, on its way to Intrepid. The fleet of Concordes was gradually phased out in the wake of an August 2000 incident in which a Concorde crashed shortly after takeoff in Paris, killing all 109 people on board.The last ever flight by a Concorde was made on November 26, 2003. That aircraft, known as Delta Foxtrot, is now housed in Aerospace Bristol, an aviation museum in the west of England.Tours of Intrepid’s Concorde will resume on April 4, the museum says.CNN’s Barry Neild contributed to this story"

        "title": "These US cities will pay you up to $15,000 to move there",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Life in the United States is pretty expensive these days. Between seemingly eternal inflation, high interest rates, and the exorbitant cost of healthcare, many Americans are looking for ways to keep more hard-earned dollars in their bank account.One option gaining traction? Relocation packages offered by some US smaller cities and towns to attract new residents.Also known as worker relocation incentive programs, these cash carrots are available across the country but share the same general premise: lure workers who have geographic flexibility with financial incentives and other perks, such as free gym memberships, co-working facilities, and even dinner with the mayor. A couple of the most lucrative offers hit five figures, and some also offer homebuyer incentives.According to MakeMyMove.com, an online marketplace connecting remote workers with locations making offers around the US, the number of cities offering such incentives has more than doubled in recent years. The pandemic brought about a seismic change in work culture and, in 2023, more than 50,000 people applied for programs across the country through the platform.However, the pay-to-move concept isn’t popular with everyone. “These programs can sometimes lead to discontent among local residents, who may feel overlooked in favor of new arrivals receiving incentives,” says Kyle Samuels, CEO of Creative Talent Endeavors, a boutique executive search firm based in Charlotte, North Carolina. “This could foster community divisions and potentially increase the cost of living, making it harder for long-term residents. We’ve seen what happens when high-paid tech workers moved to Miami and Austin during the pandemic, dramatically raising prices for locals in various ways.”Samuels also says he expects such programs to see “diminishing returns” as more companies mandate in-person attendance.Some worker incentive programs have, in fact, ended altogether, such as the Life Works Here program – launched November 2020 – that attracted remote tech workers to northwest Arkansas with $10,000 and a free bike. And after five years, Vermont wrapped up its relocation incentive program in 2023, which had initially been paying up to $10,000 to qualified workers.However, there are still plenty of active programs accepting applications, some with generous offers and plenty of extra perks. Here, a few to consider if you’re looking to make a move of your own – and get paid in the process.When it launched in 2018, Tulsa Remote became the first program of its kind by offering remote workers and entrepreneurs $10,000 to move to the south-central US city for a year.Since then, some 2,900 people have been accepted into the program, and as of December 2022, its members had generated nearly $307 million in direct employment income, according to the most recent Tulsa Remote economic impact report. In addition, the program also generated an estimated new sales tax revenue of $2.5 million for Tulsa County and $3.1 million for the state of Oklahoma. “We have also seen a strong multiplier effect of friends and family joining members in Tulsa, with the city gaining three residents for every two Tulsa Remote program participants,” Justin Harlan, managing director of Tulsa Remote, told CNN Travel via email.Applications are currently open for the next round of Tulsa transplants, and the program aims to be 4,000-members-strong by 2027, according to Harlan. Applicants must be at least 18 years of age, have lived outside of Oklahoma for at least a year prior to applying, and relocate to Tulsa within 12 months of approval.With five participating communities, Ascend West Virginia is a public-private initiative with an impressive pedigree: Its founders are West Virginia native Brad D. Smith, former CEO of software company Intuit, and his wife Alys.Now in its third year, the program provides eligible recipients, sometimes known as Ascenders, with a $12,000 cash incentive ($10,000 the first year, an additional $2,000 the second), as well as outdoorsy perks like free passes for rock climbing, ziplining and golf to explore West Virginia’s rugged landscapes, as well as access to free co-working spaces. The full relocation package is valued at more than $20,000, and to date, more than 42,500 applications have been received, according to a spokesperson.Applicants can choose from a diverse range of Ascend communities, from the small mountain town vibes of the Greenbrier Valley to outdoor adventure galore in the country’s newest national park, New River Gorge – which also is the most recent community to the program – with an impressive 96.5% retention rate across the program. In addition, organizers have submitted a funding request to the state legislature to expand the program – so there could be even more participating communities in the future.Indiana has been one of the most ambitious states when it comes to enticing a new wave of workers with financial relocation packages and perks. Dozens of cities and regions have an incentive package in place, according to MakeMyMove, and as of 2023, some 340 households have relocated to Indiana through the platform.Hopeful Hoosiers have plenty to choose from for their new home. A package valued at $15,000 in Noblesville, a suburb of Indianapolis, includes a $5,000 relocation grant, a season of free golf at two courses, and coffee with the mayor. In Evansville, meanwhile, qualified applicants can take advantage of a $7,200 incentive that includes $5,000 in cash, museum passes and a one-year membership to the oldest urban old-growth forest in the US.Choose Topeka began in 2019, offering applicants up to $15,000 in incentives via employer match funding. Since then, more than 6,000 people have applied, with nearly 150 lucky newcomers chosen to move to the Sunflower State.Unlike some incentive programs, Choose Topeka doesn’t just focus on remote workers. Transitioning veterans, people who have recently left military service, and “Boomerangs” – former residents of the Topeka area looking to return to Shawnee County – are all eligible for $5,000 in direct incentives if they accept a job offer in Topeka with a minimum salary of $50,000.Recipients are required to remain for at least a year. But an impressive 95% of them stay for the long term, according to Robert Ross, senior vice president of marketing and communications with GO Topeka, the economic development agency in Shawnee County that administers the program.“People love how accessible and friendly our community is,” Ross told CNN Travel via email. “With around 175,000 residents in Topeka, the city is very easy to navigate and recipients quickly learn that ‘Midwest nice’ is a way of life here.”If you’re considering a move to the Bluegrass State, you have plenty of places to pick from: According to MakeMyMove, there are eight cities and towns currently recruiting for new workers.The $8,800 package to relocate to Mayfield and Graves County includes $5,000 cash, as well as plenty of other perks (50% off after-school childcare, lunch with the mayor, and a free monthly delivery of eggs, just to name a few). Several cities also include a $2,500 bonus on top of $5,000 cash for workers who bring a spouse who will work locally in healthcare or education.Craving a dose of Southern hospitality for your next life chapter? In an area known as the Shoals, which spans four main cities and two counties across Alabama’s northwestern region, a program called Remote Shoals offers qualified workers up to $10,000.The program launched in June 2019 and received its fourth round of funding in 2022 for a total of $1 million in investment. As of February 2022, it had received 2,300 applications from all 50 states, as well as several from abroad, with participants coming from 22 different states.Eligible applicants must be self-employed or a full-time remote employee outside Colbert and Lauderdale counties, make $52,000 or more annually, and relocate to the Shoals area within six months of being selected.Remote workers who aren’t interested in taking a bite of the Big Apple can look to Rochester, whose Greater ROC Remote program offers $10,000 in grants and incentives (plus another $9,000 for home-buying grants).The program, which was modeled after Tulsa’s program and others, welcomed its first recipients in April 2022. The goal is to bring in about 600 participants (not including family members) over three years. To be eligible, applicants must live more than 300 miles from downtown Rochester or in any other state except New York, have a fully remote job, and be 18 years or older.Applicants who have interviewed also are eligible to visit Rochester in person, with expenses up to $500 (and $750 for a couple) reimbursable.The Last Frontier is the most sparsely populated state in the US, with the third-smallest population, hovering at around 700,000 for the last decade. But instead of dangling cash incentives to potential residents out of state, Alaska instead provides those already within its borders with a yearly sum from its Permanent Fund Dividend, or PFD.The amount is variable every year, depending on what the government provides. But in 2022, every resident received $3,284 – the highest amount so far under the program. However, in 2023 and 2024 that figure dropped to $1,312.To be eligible for the PFD, you must live in Alaska for a whole calendar year before applying. In addition, you should plan to remain there indefinitely. Other qualifying criteria also apply. Applications are open between January 1 and March 31.Prospective college students or recent grads in the Great Lakes State, this one’s for you: Approximately 350 scholarships and internships are up for grabs in The Michigander Scholars program, which is designed to attract talent for the state’s burgeoning electric vehicle, mobility and semiconductor industries.The year-old program awards scholarships ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 to qualifying recipients who complete an internship and/or accept a full-time position in industries including computing, electronics, software development, or process engineering. There are some stipulations, of course: The job or internship must come through a participating company, and recipients must commit to staying in Michigan for at least 12 months.In addition, the program is “curated,” explains Kerry Ebersole Singh, chief talent solutions and engagement officer at Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which runs the program. After being selected to join a “cohort” of qualified candidates, “then they are brought into special opportunities to do meet and greets with employers that then lead to either an internship opportunity and or a job opportunity.”So far, the program has awarded 62 scholarships, with 521 students currently participating in the cohort. The current initial phase will award up to 350 scholarships, but Ebersole Singh says the program is growing.“We’re only looking at ways to strategically expand the program, whether that is opening up more opportunities through our employers and these scholarships for out-of-state students or out-of-state schools or … directly tying this to homeownership and other [incentives],” she tells CNN. “So, I definitely foresee us looking at how to grow this in strategic areas versus winding it down at this point.”"

        "title": "Why this is Las Vegas’ hottest neighborhood",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Visitors love Las Vegas for the glitz, glam and garishness of the resorts that line the 4.2-mile Las Vegas Strip, but the most exciting neighborhood in the city right now is all about art.This area, fittingly called the Arts District, has become a haven for local creatives.It’s a hotbed of culinary excellence, visual spectacle, digital design and immersive theater. It’s home to one of the city’s most popular restaurants, several cult-favorite bars and breweries, one-of-a-kind shopping and a boutique hotel. It’s even got the city’s only indoor half-pipe.In a town synonymous with flashing neon, blaring slots and other electronic marvels, the Arts District continues to captivate with seemingly boundless achievements of the human mind.It also happens to be largely a mystery to those from out of town.There’s no formal data on how many of the 40.8 million visitors to Las Vegas in 2023 made it to the Arts District. Whatever the number, it’s a fraction of the visitors who arrive in town, check in at a hotel on the Strip and never venture more than a short walk or rideshare away.The Arts District was officially created in the late 1990s. Back then, it received the nickname 18b, owing to an 18-block area bounded by Hoover Avenue, Colorado Avenue, Las Vegas Boulevard, Commerce Street and 4th Street. Over time, the neighborhood has grown beyond these boundaries.Today it loosely encompasses about 25 to 30 blocks (depending on whom you ask) south and west of Downtown.In the beginning, the neighborhood revolved around a destination called The Arts Factory, a circa-1920s building that was repurposed to hold studios for more than 30 artists.First Friday, a street fair and gallery crawl on the first Friday of every month, started in 2002 and was designed to get people into the area.Gradually, in the 2010s, the Arts District started growing.The first inflection point came in 2013 when sisters Christina and Pamela Dylag opened the Velveteen Rabbit, a laid-back cocktail bar on Main Street. Another came in 2016, when Derek Stonebarger opened ReBAR, a dive bar inside an antique store practically across the street.The modern era began in 2018, when chef and Las Vegas native James Trees opened an Italian restaurant named after his great aunt: Esther’s Kitchen.With its handmade pastas and obsessive selection of amari behind the bar, Esther’s became a sensation practically overnight. In 2020, Trees was named a finalist for the James Beard Award: Best Chef Southwest.During the Covid-19 pandemic, he became beloved among locals for take-home pasta kits and a village of converted greenhouses for al fresco, socially distanced dining out back. By early 2023, it was harder to get a reservation at Esther’s than it was to get one at many high-end restaurants on the Strip.That’s when Trees decided to expand.Instead of adding to the original location’s 58-seat dining room, he bought the circa-1943 Retro Vegas building on the corner of Main Street and California Avenue. The new $6 million digs, which opened March 8, seat 160 in the dining room and 27 at a standalone bar. The new kitchen is twice the size of the original restaurant.Perhaps most importantly, Trees said that when dinner service ends around 11 p.m. every night, the new location will stay open with a limited menu until 2 a.m., a first for a restaurant in this part of the city.“The new number of tables and [the new extended] hours aren’t to add more covers, we just want to allow people to actually be able to get a reservation, then come and spend more time and enjoy themselves,” he said.Esther’s Kitchen isn’t the only passion project in the Arts District; over the last few years, dozens of shops and other destinations have put down roots in the neighborhood, too.Take Fresa’s Skate Shop, home to the only indoor half-pipe in Las Vegas. Owner Amanda Quintanilla, who is from El Salvador, started the Main Street shop in 2022 as a place to support the local roller-skating and rollerblading communities. Today, the store sells dozens of different skates and blades and welcomes skaters to come and use the ramp for $15 per person per hour. Fresa’s rents skates and blades, too.“When I started skating [during the pandemic], the Arts District was the place to come and skate and hang out with other people who were into the scene,” she said. “It’s still the place to come and skate and connect with other people in the community, and now we are a huge part of that.”At Spilled Milk, a home store on Commerce Street, guests can purchase funky glassware, colorful candleholders, pots in the shape of animal heads and exclusive items from local ceramicists.Owner Kori Cortez opened the store in February after years of pop-ups at which she sold her own macrame rainbows and other original wall-hangings.“I developed a love [for] and connection to the Arts District,” said Cortez, who previously played bass in an electronic rock band. “The murals, the coffee shops and the artsy people — I didn’t want to be anywhere else.”Even veteran hospitality personalities are getting in on Arts District action.Chef Wolfgang Puck is a co-owner of 1228 Main, a bistro that opened in July, and locals line up on weekends for pastries and loaves of freshly baked bread. The English Hotel, which opened in 2022, bears the name of celebrity chef Todd English.Of course, art is still the main driving force behind everything in the neighborhood.The Arts Factory remains the geographic and creative center, with artisans ranging from painters to jewelers keeping studios inside. Nearby, the “Greetings from Las Vegas” mural was painted in 2020, and it is now one of the most photographed destinations in the entire city.Galleries span the gamut from cutting edge NFTs (the JRNY Gallery) to more conventional contemporary art (the Priscilla Fowler Fine Art Gallery). Geller Gallery, set to open on Commerce Street in March, specializes exclusively in imported art.There’s also a shop where fans can purchase original work, prints and merchandise from Adam Rellah, the man behind the modern art brand Pretty Done. Rellah opened the storefront in August after painting murals all over the city. He said he didn’t even think about opening anywhere else.“Main Street is the new Downtown,” he said. “Las Vegas is small, so there aren’t other places that embrace weird art, creativity, uniqueness and individuality. It’s like we set ourselves up for this [Arts District] revival. I’m glad it’s becoming what it is now.”Theater is alive and well in the Arts District, too.The LaMarre Theater is the only free-standing theater in Las Vegas with Black owners and operators, and the Majestic Repertory Theatre continues to generate buzz for immersive performances that make the audience part of the show. The Cockroach Theater (yes, that’s really its name) is the second stage of the Vegas Theatre Company and spotlights emerging thespians.The Arts District also has built a reputation for its eclectic nightlife—a scene that is more loungey, vibey and down-to-earth than the thumping and spendy nightclubs on the Strip.Velveteen Rabbit and ReBAR were pioneers in this space, and subsequent additions such as Jammyland (with a Jamaican motif), Silver Stamp (with a robust beer menu), and Nightmare Café (a horror-themed cross-between TGI Fridays and Spirit Halloween) laid the groundwork for further innovation.18bin, a newish outdoor bar just east of the Arts Factory building, is always hopping, even at noon on a Friday.The past six months have seen other noteworthy newcomers to Arts District nightlife.Most recently, the vintage store Vintage Vegas opened a 1980s-themed cocktail lounge on March 1 stocked with barware and other period pieces guests can buy.At Liquid Diet, accessible through an alley or unmarked door off Commerce Street (look for the mural of a bloody hand), co-owners Brett Pfister and Patrick Mannion list the nightly menu on handwritten pieces of brown butcher paper hanging from the bar, and they serve cocktails in mismatched ceramics and glassware curated from local antique stores.At Stray Pirate, a pirate-themed bar, portraits on the walls depict dogs dressed as scallywags (see what they did there?), and booze-heavy drinks will have you wondering whether the digital images of whales and sharks you can see through “windows” behind the bar are real.Chris Gutierrez, general manager and partner, said the bar is the perfect representation of what the Arts District is all about.“When we were contemplating where to build Stray Pirate, the Arts District was the perfect location for our concept: A walkable community full of other food and beverage experiences that push each other to build on creativity,” said Gutierrez, who is famous around Las Vegas for the cocktail programs he created at bars such as Corduroy, Oak & Ivy and Atomic Liquors.“Our concept really focuses on not only craft cocktails, but is an immersive, fun, tropical cocktail bar. Ultimately, the Arts District’s ethos and Stray Pirate are aligned in providing creative cocktails, service and experience for our guests.”The Arts District also has birthed its share of craft breweries and wine bars in the past few years.On the brewery front, locals love Nevada Brew Works (and the adjacent Soul Belly BBQ), and the slightly more hipster Able Baker Brewing, which also serves food. For oenophiles, The Wine Garden offers monthly classes where guests can sip wine and create flower crowns, while Garagiste offers tastings and light snacks in a modern space.Evolution of the Arts District will continue into the second half of 2024 and beyond.Toward the southern end of the neighborhood (or just beyond it; again, depending on whom you ask), the Atomic Golf driving range is slated to open in March.Later this spring, Trees is planning to launch two additional experiences at the new Esther’s: a second story as-yet-unnamed cocktail lounge that overlooks the main dining room, and an enclosed courtyard that would host farmers’ markets on Sundays. In the fall, he is planning to open a French bistro and bar in an old service station several blocks south, and a prix fixe, fine-dining restaurant in the location of the old Esther’s.Also this summer, Nevada H&C Distilling, renowned for its Smoke Wagon Bourbon, was expected to open a new facility on the corner of Wyoming Avenue and Industrial Road. The new digs were expected to comprise an expansive production area, as well as a gift shop where visitors can purchase products and check in for tours.On a longer timeline, the city has green-lighted the construction of more than 3,000 new living units in and around the Arts District — developments that most certainly will change the complexion of the neighborhood once again.In a city that reinvents itself constantly, it’s good to know the next evolution will be inspired by art.Matt Villano, a writer and editor in Northern California, has covered Las Vegas for 20 years."

        "title": "‘I want to get off the plane.’ The passengers refusing to fly on Boeing’s 737 Max",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Ed Pierson was flying from Seattle to New Jersey in 2023, when he ended up boarding a plane he’d never wanted to fly on.The Seattle resident booked with Alaska Airlines last March, purposefully selecting a flight with a plane he was happy to board – essentially, anything but a Boeing 737 Max.“I got to the airport, checked again that it wasn’t the Max. I went through security, got coffee. I walked onto the plane – I thought, it’s kinda new,” Pierson told CNN. “Then I sat down and on the emergency card [in the seat pocket] it said it was a Max.”He got up and walked off.“A flight attendant was closing the front door. I said, ‘I wasn’t supposed to fly the Max.’ She was like, ‘What do you know about the Max?,’” he said.“I said, ‘I can’t go into detail right now, but I wasn’t planning on flying the Max, and I want to get off the plane.’”Pierson made it to New Jersey – after some back and forth, he said, Alaska’s airport staff rebooked him onto a red-eye that evening on a different plane. Spending the whole day in the airport was worth it to avoid flying on the Max, he said.Pierson has a unique and first-hand perspective of the aircraft, made by Boeing at its Renton factory in the state of Washington. Now the executive director of airline watchdog group Foundation for Aviation Safety, he served as a squadron commanding officer among other leadership roles during a 30-year Naval career, followed by 10 years at Boeing – including three as a senior manager in production support at Renton itself, working on the 737 Max project before its launch.But he’s one of a number of travelers who do not want to board the aircraft which has been at the heart of two fatal crashes, as well as the January 5 incident in which part of the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines plane blew out mid-air. The part – a door plug – was found to be missing four bolts that should have held it in place. Further reports of “many” loose bolts and misdrilled holes have emerged from the subsequent investigations into the Max 9 model after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered the grounding of 171 Max 9 aircraft with the same door plug.Experts agree that the Alaska incident could have been worse, and the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has warned that “something like this can happen again.”The previous model, the Max 8, was involved in two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people. The crashes were widely attributed to the malfunctioning of MCAS, an automated system in the Max designed to stabilize the pitch of the plane, overriding pilot input in some circumstances. Boeing accepted its liability in 2021 for one of the crashes.Weeks after the Alaska incident, Boeing CEO David Calhoun told investors on a quarterly call: “We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA at every turn… This increased scrutiny, whether it comes from us or a regulator or from third parties will make us better.”“We caused the problem, and we understand that,” Calhoun said. “Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.”In February, in the wake of the Alaska incident, the company removed the head of the Max program from his position and reshuffled other senior management figures.The move comes as critics have repeatedly said that the aircraft manufacturer is prioritizing profits over safety.The FAA is now “taking a holistic look at the quality control issues at Boeing to ensure safety is always the company’s top priority,” a spokesperson for the government agency told CNN. Representatives are on the ground assessing the production lines at Boeing’s Renton factory and Spirit AeroSystems, whose Wichita, Kansas factory made the door plug that blew off mid-flight in the Alaska incident.On February 28, the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to address quality and safety issues.Boeing told CNN: “Every day, more than 80 airlines operate about 5,000 flights with the global fleet of 1,300 737 MAX airplanes, carrying 700,000 passengers to their destinations safely. The 737 MAX family’s in-service reliability is above 99% and consistent with other commercial airplane models.”Of course, many thousands of people board Max aircraft with no concerns. But do other passengers care? It appears that enough do.The last time the Max was grounded – for 20 months, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 on a Max 8 in March 2019 – 25% of the 1,005 Americans questioned in a Reuters/Ipsos poll said that they had “not a lot” or “no” confidence in the aircraft – compared to 31% who did, and 44% who were unsure. The poll was taken in December 2020, shortly before the aircraft’s return to the skies.After being “told about the aircraft’s safety issues,” a further 57% said they would be somewhat unlikely or not likely to fly in a Max, according to the report. Nearly half – 45% – said that they would still be somewhat unlikely or not very likely to fly in it after it had been back in the air for six months. And 31% of all respondents said that they had little to no confidence that the Federation Aviation Administration (FAA) “puts passenger and crew safety first when determining whether an aircraft is fit to fly.”Most countries cleared the Max 8 to fly again by 2021, but three years on, there still appears to be negative public opinion about the Max.“It’s unsettling that there have been so many issues with this specific type of plane,” Stephanie King, a passenger on the affected Alaska Airlines flight, told CNN in January. “I hope something is done so that this doesn’t happen again.”Then there’s flight booking site Kayak, which has seen usage of its filter to deselect Max aircraft (models 8 and 9) during the booking process increase 15-fold since January, the company told CNN. The site introduced the filter in March 2019, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash.Doubts have also remained across the industry as a whole. Following the Alaska incident, a February AP-Norc poll regarding air travel safety found nearly a third of Americans surveyed answered “not at all” or “a little” when asked if they believe that airplanes are safe from structural faults. While planes were generally viewed to be as safe as cars or trains for means of transportation, fewer than two in 10 surveyed strongly agreed that planes are fault-free.Belén Estacio has boycotted the Max since the January incident. Shortly after the Alaska Airlines fuselage blowout, she was scheduled on a Max for a work flight.“My boyfriend didn’t want me to fly on it so I changed my travel plans to make sure I wasn’t flying on any type of Max,” she said.“It doesn’t matter which model, I don’t want to fly them.” To her, she said, “The Alaska incident was further confirmation that Boeing is still not being thorough and not fixing its issues.”Florida-based Estacio, who works in marketing, now checks the aircraft type before booking any flight. She’s made two trips since January.“The whole thing of, ‘If it’s not Boeing I ain’t going,’ it’s totally the opposite now,” she said. “I’m very happy when I’ve seen I’ll be flying an Airbus.”She says she’s not the only one in her circle, and says she knows people employing both “soft” and “hard” boycotts.“Some say, ‘Absolutely not,’ others say, ‘If I can change it, I will; if not I’ll just go on it.’”UK-based communications consultant Elayne Grimes is another with a personal boycott. Grimes, who travels regularly for work, was worried following the Max 8’s first crash in October 2018: Lion Air flight 610, in Indonesia, which killed all 189 onboard a plane in service for less than three months. Grimes – who’d previously worked in emergency crisis management – was immediately concerned about Boeing’s new aircraft, which had launched to great fanfare in 2017.“I actively sought out airlines that didn’t have the Max,” she said. When Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed in March 2019, killing another 157 people, it confirmed her resolve.In 2022, Grimes watched “Downfall: The Case Against Boeing,” a Netflix documentary directed by Rory Kennedy, which looked at the two tragedies and flagged concerns about the working environment at Boeing.“I watched that and thought [Boeing] was an organization putting profit before people, and thought, ‘That’s not for me.’ I don’t see myself flying one in the near future,” she said.While the FAA has cleared the Max to fly once more, Grimes believes that “its issues are not resolved.”“When the door came off and they called [the planes] in and found other aircraft with issues, I thought ‘Hmm,’” she said. “It’s just not an aircraft I’d want to fly.”Grimes is a self-declared “avgeek,” or aviation fanatic – and she’s not the only one monitoring the industry closely to have reservations. Elliot Sharod, who says he took 78 flights last year, is on the fence. “I wouldn’t exactly refuse to fly it, but I’d ideally fly an Airbus if given the choice,” he said.A former aviation journalist, who wished to remain anonymous for professional reasons, says they lost trust after the second crash.“After the first one, the predominant talking points were, ‘Oh, it’s got to be pilot error, or the weather – it can’t be the plane,” they say. “It was Boeing. I believed that everything coming out of Boeing had been tested and retested – it had to be something else.“Then the Ethiopian crash happened, and there was a bit of the same messaging, but finally it came out that actually it was the plane. I lost all trust at that point in the Max.”They say they still love flying the “older style of Boeings – the 777s and the original 737s.”“They were all designed back in the days when engineers ruled Boeing,” they say. “I feel I can trust them more than the Max.”“Would you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn’t.”They sound like the words of an anxious passenger in 2024. In fact, they were written by one Boeing employee to another in February 2018 – eight months before the Lion Air crash. (In the internal communications, their co-worker replied, simply, “No.”)In April 2017, in internal messages by Boeing employees working on the soon-to-be-released Max, another employee wrote, “This airplane is designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.” The same exchange included a reference to the aircraft’s “piss poor design.” A design tweak was labelled as “patching the leaky boat.”These internal communications were released as part of the 18-month investigation into the Max by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In a 238-page report, released in September 2020, the committee outlined “the serious flaws and missteps in the design, development, and certification of the aircraft.” The report highlighted five key themes, including “production pressures that jeopardized the safety of the flying public” and a “culture of concealment” at Boeing.At the time, Boeing said that the communications “do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable.” The company issued a statement acknowledging the committee’s findings and saying that the victims of the crashes were “in our thoughts and prayers.”Boeing said that when the Max 8 returned to service it would be “one of the most thoroughly scrutinized aircraft in history, and we have full confidence in its safety.”It added: “We have been hard at work strengthening our safety culture and rebuilding trust with our customers, regulators, and the flying public… We have made fundamental changes to our company… and continue to look for ways to improve.”The House Committee report also included concerns about the FAA and its “grossly insufficient oversight” over Boeing during the Max design process and in the period between the two crashes. The report said that “gaps in the regulatory system at the FAA… allowed this fatally flawed plane into service.”A spokesperson for the FAA told CNN: “The FAA made significant improvements to its delegation and aircraft certification processes in recent years and took immediate action following the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines door plug incident to address concerns about the quality of aircraft that Boeing and its suppliers produce.”Rory Kennedy followed the investigation from start to finish. The director of “Downfall” told CNN she didn’t have a “strong opinion” on the plane until she started making the documentary in early 2020.But, she said, “I was shocked by what we discovered… [it] was really disturbing.”Her film is a forensic investigation of the two crashes. “Downfall” interviews ex-Boeing staff and concerned pilots, who paint a picture of an accident waiting to happen. It follows the congressional hearings held as part of the House investigation, and interviews the victims’ families.Kennedy says that during the design process Boeing “went to great pains to hide [MCAS] and how powerful it was.” The stabilizing system was designed specifically for the Max, since the fuel-efficient engines being added to the 1960s-designed plane affected the trim. The House committee found that Boeing concealed its existence from the FAA, airlines and pilots.Additionally, after the Lion Air crash, FAA analysis in December 2018 predicted that without a software fix, a Max could crash on average once every two years over the course of its usage. Yet the plane was not grounded at the time.“Boeing and FAA both gambled with public safety,” House committee chair Peter DeFazio said in a 2020 statement.“We are already undertaking important initiatives based on what we have learned… these initiatives are focused on advancing overall aviation safety by improving our organization, process and culture,” the FAA said in a statement following the committee’s report.“[They] decided to keep the plane in the air, to save money and try to have a fix before the next plane crashed,” said Kennedy. “I interviewed [family members of the victims] as they were understanding that they knew this. Can you imagine?”“I would absolutely not fly that plane,” she told CNN. “I’ve not noticed the culture of Boeing has shifted from one that prioritizes finances over safety.”She says that one of the factors that pushed her to make the documentary, was “talking to pilots who were telling me, ‘Absolutely don’t get on that plane.’”And while she initially received pushback about the film, including from family and friends, “When the door ripped off the airplane, people said, ‘You’re so vindicated.’”Her research also highlighted production issues in the 787 Dreamliner – Boeing’s flagship long-haul aircraft, which debuted in 2011. As a result, she avoids that, too – and suggests that instead of confining their investigations to individual planes, the FAA and NTSB should be investigating Boeing as a whole.A spokesperson for the FAA said that it has blocked production expansion of the Max, and “is conducting enhanced oversight of Boeing and its suppliers. The agency is examining all aspects of Boeing’s three manufacturing lines and Spirit AeroSystems’ supplier activities. A dedicated team of approximately two dozen aviation safety inspectors is conducting these reviews at the Boeing 737 MAX facility in Renton, Washington, and at Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas.”Kennedy wants a “proper hearing” in Congress – similar to the one that investigated the Max crashes.“To me, what you really need is an investigation into the culture of Boeing, what’s happening at board level, and what kind of decisions are being made to continue to prioritize financial interests over the safety of consumers,” she says.Critics say that Boeing’s 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas saw the culture change from one that emphasized engineering prowess to one intent on watching the bottom line.Damning its “broken safety culture,” DeFazio said after the 2020 investigation that “Boeing – under pressure to compete with Airbus and deliver profits for Wall Street – escaped scrutiny from the FAA, withheld critical information from pilots, and ultimately put planes into service that killed 346 innocent people.”In 2021, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle criminal charges that the company defrauded the FAA when the Max was first certified.“The reason that [Boeing’s] culture is so damaging is because they are in a numbers game, and they want to make as much profit as possible at any cost. And for me, that cost me my friend,” says Deveney Williams.In March 2019, Williams’ friend, Samya Stumo, was onboard the Ethiopian Airlines flight. The pair had been due to move into an apartment together in Washington, D.C.“I avoid Boeing as much as possible – I try to get on an Airbus even if it costs more or is a different route,” said Williams.“I never knew about plane models prior to this, but I’ve educated myself onto how to see the model when buying a ticket. I’ve got friends who ask how they can switch flights, or figure out how to avoid flying on this. I’ve learned a lot – I don’t want this happening to anyone else.”For Williams, the Alaska incident was a “weird relief” – because it happened in the US. The aspersions that were cast on the pilots of the two crashes didn’t happen in January. “This time, it’s on American soil, I’m presuming it was an American pilot – so they don’t have any other fingers to point.”Torleif Stumo – Samya’s brother – had a similar incident to Ed Pierson, in which he says his plane was switched to a Max at the last moment. Like Pierson, he only noticed when he saw the safety card in the seat pocket of his flight from Panama City to Bogotá in August 2023.“I don’t really have anxiety, I’ve never had panic attacks but that was one of the closest times I ever came,” he says.“The crew were amazing. They had disconnected from the jetway and initially offered to change my seat to first class. But then I told them why I wanted to get off. They immediately understood and brought the plane back [to the gate].”Stumo ended up spending the night at an airport hotel. The airline he was traveling with agreed to rebook him fee-free having listened to a phone call he’d made to customer services when originally buying the ticket. In it, he’d been assured that he wouldn’t be on a Max.Williams and Kennedy both say they’ve had similar experiences with their aircraft switched to a Max at the last minute.Stumo believes that it’s not easy enough for consumers to tell whether they’ve been booked onto a Max. Michael Stumo, Samya and Torleif’s father, wants aircraft types to be “prominently displayed” during the booking process, he tells CNN.Following the January 5 incident, Alaska and United – the US carriers which use the Max 9 – issued waivers allowing passengers unwilling to fly the Max flexibility. These have now expired, but Alaska told CNN that concerned passengers can be rebooked onto a different aircraft for free, by calling reservations.“We have complete confidence in the safety of all our aircraft,” they added.A spokesperson for United said the airline “has no change fees on most tickets. We’re happy to work with customers with concerns to find a solution that works for them.”Pierson’s Foundation for Aviation Safety – established in 2023 as a watchdog for both the aviation industry and the government entities that regulate it – added a page to their website in February for passengers reluctant to fly on the plane. It explains how to check the plane assigned for one’s flight before booking, refusing to board, and rebooking at the airport.Pierson says the foundation gets many requests from the public asking whether it’s safe to fly the Max.The former Boeing employee has been critical of Boeing company since the aircraft was first on the production line. Over the summer of 2018, he sent several messages up the chain at Boeing, having noticed what he now says was an “unstable production line.” In emails which he has since shared publicly, Pierson warned of his concerns that the intense pressure to get planes out of the factory was leading exhausted workers to cut corners. He feared that it could end in tragedy, he wrote.Having taken early retirement in August 2018 – “I knew it was an unhealthy working environment and couldn’t support the leadership anymore,” he told CNN – he wrote again to the board of Boeing, as well as to the FAA, after the Lion Air crash, and then again after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. He later testified at the congressional hearing.“I would definitely not fly that plane,” he says now. “The same problems that I saw in 2017 and 2018 have not been resolved. The factory is still putting huge amounts of pressure on employees that build the planes, and they’ve had many production quality defects that just came to light.”Although the Max is flying once more, its future appears to be up in the air. The FAA has capped production of new aircraft, and launched an investigation “into whether Boeing failed to maintain their quality system in accordance with federal regulations.” It has also launched an analysis of “potential safety-focused reforms around quality control,” a spokesperson told CNN.As part of its “enhanced oversight,” FAA teams are reviewing Boeing’s Max production system, and Spirit AeroSystems’ production system for the aircraft’s fuselage. It is also reviewing employee training and qualifications, increasing its onsite presence at Max manufacturing facilities, and looking at “how Boeing transfers unfinished work from suppliers to its production lines,” a spokesperson told CNN.Meanwhile, the NTSB’s investigation into what happened on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 continues.A preliminary NTSB report does not lay blame on Boeing nor find a probable cause, which is typically included in the NTSB’s final report which could take a year or more.Spirit said following the incident it was cooperating with the NTSB and added, “as a company, we remain focused on the quality of each aircraft structure that leaves our facilities.”For Michael Stumo, the Alaska incident proved his fears. “We have nine years of [Boeing] getting caught, promising to do better, and they don’t,” he said. “Now we have this: where they can’t even put plug doors in a plane, can’t fix bolts.”Stumo wants Boeing to “bring in people who know how to do complex manufacturing processes.”“These people exist. Boeing has a lot of money. Hire them,” he said.A Boeing spokesperson said the company has “invested heavily in our workforce over the last several years.” Engineering staff are up by 10% and manufacturing by 11%, they said, while they have “increased the number of Commercial Airplanes quality inspectors by 20%, and have said we will continue to hire.”“We have also invested in quality across the company, growing the number of quality employees by more than 25%, exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels,” they added.Stumo says the company needs urgent change.“The first crash shouldn’t have happened. The second they had full knowledge of [the MCAS malfunctioning] – it absolutely shouldn’t have happened.“We want no third crash. And we want Boeing transformed back into the superior aviation engineering company making amazing and safe products that it was.”"

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "It rains an average of 171 days per year in Singapore. But one hotel in the Lion City is taking a gamble to ensure that rain doesn’t spoil its guests’ holidays.The InterContinental Singapore’s “Rain Resist Bliss” package will reimburse one night of a guest’s stay if one of their planned activities ends up getting rained out.“​​I was chatting with a group of friends about what’s next in luxury travel and one of them jokingly commented that being able to guarantee good weather would be the next level of ultimate luxury travel,” the hotel’s general manager, Andreas Kraemer, tells CNN. From there, the concept of a rain insurance package was born.Still, there are caveats. The InterContinental isn’t going to hand out cash every single time it rains. According to a release from the hotel, ​​the criteria is met when “rain duration exceeds 120 cumulative minutes within any 4-hour block of time during daylight hours.”The package also is only applicable to people staying in suites, which begin at 850 SGD ($633) a night for junior suites and start at 4,500 SGD ($3,349) for the presidential suite.The money comes in the form of a voucher, which must be spent at the InterContinental Singapore within six months, and the amount you get is equivalent to one night’s stay in your room category.Kraemer’s own personal rainy day favorite things to do in Singapore include visiting the Asian Civilizations Museum, taking a tour of Tiger Brewery and shopping at the local outpost of Japanese bookstore Kinokuniya.Special packages like these can be a way for an established hotel to stand out from the pack.In Bali, one hotel banned smartphones and other electronics by the pool as a way to encourage guests to unplug and relax.Meanwhile, several hotels and resorts around the world, including the Park Hyatt New York, have created special rooms designed for getting an optimal night’s sleep, complete with white noise machines, weighted blankets and special sleepytime teas."

        "title": "Spring break in Miami Beach: Breaking up is hard to do",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Miami Beach may be breaking up with spring break, but spring break isn’t moving on just yet. It’s a complicated, sometimes toxic, affair.City officials and business owners have had to balance the billions of dollars generated by visitors with successive years of unruly crowds and spring break violence. Two fatal shootings in 2023 led to a state of emergency and a midnight curfew in the popular destination for partying college students.Last week, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he was dispatching 140 state troopers throughout the Sunshine State – 45 of them in Miami Beach – to keep raucous spring breakers in check during the annual ritual.The tough love comes amid a City of Miami Beach breakup campaign that includes hefty fines, curfews, bag checks, restricted beach access, DUI checkpoints, $100 parking fees and nonresident towing rates of more than $500.“This isn’t working anymore,” a young actor says in a viral YouTube video announcing the “breaking up” campaign. “And it’s not us. It’s you. We just want different things.”For David Wallack, the owner of Mango’s Tropical Cafe in South Beach, a breaking point in the long love-hate relationship came after a series of stampedes last March.“That was like the final straw for me,” Wallack said.The mayhem unfolded outside Mango’s, which was packed inside and out with diners and revelers. Overlooking the beach, the restaurant/club is one of Miami Beach’s better-known nightspots, an Ocean Drive institution for more than 30 years.Wallack said there were multiple stampedes in the area last spring. The mad rush can be sparked by a fight, a scream, a firecracker and, of course, a gunshot, he said.“Hundreds and hundreds of people running in panic,” Wallack recalled. “Tables and chairs go flying. People have to run for their lives.”He contemplated shutting down his establishment. “But time and months and months soften you. So you become hopeful again.”On a visit to Miami Beach on Tuesday, the Republican governor stood with Miami Beach Mayor Steven Meiner to announce the deployment of state troopers to enhance security.“Florida is a very welcoming state. We welcome people to come and have a good time. What we don’t welcome is criminal activity. What we don’t welcome is mayhem and people that want to wreak havoc on our communities,” DeSantis told reporters.“Make no mistake about it: If you’re coming here in order to enjoy Florida and have a good time, fine. If you’re coming for these other reasons, if you’re committing crimes, causing havoc, you are going to pay the price and we will hold you accountable.”The troopers will assist multiple local law enforcement agencies, and a rapid-response team of 24 troopers will be on standby in the state’s most popular spring break destinations – Panama City, Daytona Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Miami/Miami Beach.The troopers will help with crowd control, DUI checkpoints, license plate readers and directing traffic.“We’ve had enough,” Meiner told reporters.The Miami City Commission last month approved a series of measures to enhance public safety during spring break, including security checkpoints at beach entrances, more DUI inspections and a greater presence of law enforcement from Miami and other jurisdictions.“Every police officer in the Miami Beach Police Department will be working a minimum of 13 hours and some as much as 16 hours per day during spring break,” Chief Wayne Jones told CNN.“More police than ever before. More restrictions than ever before,” he said. “The idea is not to ruin the fun for kids coming down for spring break. The idea is to keep people safe.”On March 17 last year, a Friday, violence erupted in South Beach amid both St. Patrick’s Day festivities and spring break partying, leaving one person dead and another injured, according to authorities. Four firearms were recovered, police said.Later that same weekend, Miami Beach police said, another person was fatally shot and another injured, prompting city officials to issue a state of emergency and a midnight curfew.In 2022, the City of Miami Beach similarly imposed a midnight curfew after two spring break shootings left five people injured on Ocean Drive.On CNN Sunday morning, Meiner was asked about a Miami Herald Op-ed, which said “pricing out parking or closing public garages during two weekends that attract Black and brown people is discriminatory.”“We are trying to keep people safe,” the mayor said. “Last year we had two Black males shot and killed in our streets and I can tell you … it’s painful. It’s hurtful when anyone is hurt on your streets. And I feel I have a moral and ethical obligation to keep everyone safe in our city.”Meiner defended the stricter measures in place during the busier second and third weeks of this month.“It’s been the second and third weeks of March where we’ve had our biggest issues and that’s why we’ve put the more robust measures in place,” he said.He added, “I’m very comfortable with the measures we’re taking and I’m very proud of what we’re doing.”Jones said the size of the long but slender barrier island played a role in controlling large crowds.“The biggest issue for spring break is simple capacity. We are bursting at the seam,” Jones said. “In order to control that you have to mitigate the amount of people coming here during spring break. That’s why … we’re breaking up with spring break. We hope it’s an amicable separation. We want people to have a good time. We really don’t want them not to play by our rules.”Nearly half of the people arrested during spring break each year are from South Florida, said Jones, who joined the police department in 1996 and rose through the ranks.Asked about criticism in some quarters that the spring break crackdown unfairly targeted Black Floridians, the city’s first Black police chief said: “As a Black man, I’m hypersensitive to that.”“As a teenager … my dad discouraged me from coming to Miami Beach because of the impression that Black young men weren’t treated well here,” he said. “We’re in the business of policing behavior, not race or ethnicity.”The City of Miami Beach sits on a small barrier island between Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the spring break revelry happens along 10 sun-splashed blocks of art deco hotels, trendy restaurants and nightspots on Ocean Drive.Katie Ryan, a spring breaker from Connecticut, arrived in Miami Beach with friends on Monday. She was sunbathing on a quiet stretch of beach the other day. The area seemed tame, she said, compared to previous “crazy” spring break stays in Fort Lauderdale, about 35 miles north.“I saw the videos before coming here about how crazy it was going to be, so maybe people were like, ‘Never mind, we shouldn’t go there,’” Ryan said.Her friend, Avery Caimes, marveled at how tranquil the beach seemed just a day before the usually busy second weekend of spring break. “There is plenty of space. It’s not loud,” she said.Mark Evenson, a spring breaker from Minnesota, said he had “mixed feelings” about the efforts to tone down the partying.“I’m here enjoying kind of what they are trying to stop from happening, but I understand why they’re doing it,” he said of local authorities. “For the most part, I think everyone here is just trying to have some fun.”Outside Mango’s, Wallack said sidewalk seating on his stretch of Ocean Drive will be shut down on weekends under the spring break restrictions – meaning about a 30% cut in profits for businesses with cafes.“If they curfew and we have no nightclub … what are we left with? A whole lot of salaries and a kitchen,” he said. “If it’s anything like it’s been the last few years, it’s very, very bad for business.”CNN’s Chris Boyette contributed to this report."

        "title": "They fell in love three decades ago. Now they pilot planes together",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "On their first flight together, Joel Atkinson and Shelley Atkinson couldn’t contain their excitement. They enthused to the flight attendants. They posed for photos. They told passengers via a pre-flight announcement.“We made a big deal about it,” Joel tells CNN Travel.Then, right before take off, Joel and Shelley sat side by side in the flight deck, just the two of them. They’d come full circle, and were about to embark on an exciting new chapter.“It felt amazing,” Shelley tells CNN Travel.“As we prepared to take off, I was giddy, euphoric,” says Joel.Joel and Shelley met as twentysomethings flying jets in the US Air Force. They became fast friends, then, over time, fell in love.Today, they’ve been married for 27 years and counting. They’ve brought up two kids together. And now they’re both pilots for Southwest Airlines. They regularly fly together, with Joel as captain and Shelley as first officer.The couple say working together is “amazing.” They treat layovers as “date nights.” They learn from one another’s respective “wisdom and judgment.”And no, they don’t argue mid-flight.“People ask us, how does it work, flying together?” says Joel. “We know a few pilot couples and some of them fly together, some of them don’t. I’ve heard people say, ‘Oh I could never fly with my wife or my husband.’”For Joel and Shelley, working together is seamless – a joy that comes easily to them both.“We’re best friends,” says Shelley.“There’s just that unspoken bond,” says Joel.Shelley grew up in Iowa and moved to Colorado – Joel’s home state – as a teenager. The two spent their high school years unaware of one another, but they graduated the same year, and both opted to study at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado in the late 1980s.Joel says he was very influenced by the 1985 Tom Cruise movie “Top Gun” – “which made flying jets look like a lot of fun.” For Shelley, who was an athlete, the appeal of the Air Force Academy was less about flying – which she only really discovered once she was enrolled – and more an opportunity to play college basketball.“I didn’t attend the Academy to pursue flying, initially. Once I was there I realized it was a great opportunity for a fun and challenging career,” she says. “And the introduction to flying there made me want to pursue it further.”Joel and Shelley spent four years studying at the Air Force Academy without actually crossing paths, although Joel was vaguely aware of Shelley.“There’s not that many women at the Air Force Academy, so I kind of knew who she was,” he says.The two finally met a few years later, after they’d both completed pilot training in different states. They got the same first assignment – flying Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in Texas.When Shelley arrived in Texas, Joel had been there for a few months.“So I was there, kind of established, and she came into the office where I was working,” he recalls. “She came in and turned in the paperwork, and we said, ‘Hi,’ just exchanged some pleasantries.”Joel was struck by Shelley right away.“She’s tall. She looks great. She left the room and this other coworker was just looking at me smiling. And I said, ‘What?’ And he could tell.”Looking back, Joel thinks it was the “eye contact” he had with Shelley that gave his feelings away. Or maybe just “the look on my face.”“There was something there,” says Joel, smiling. “But I just kind of laughed it off. I was like, ‘Nah, we’re just going to be friends.’”Joel was also a bit intimidated by Shelley – he was “attracted to her right away,” but didn’t know if she’d ever be interested in him.“She’s taller than me. And I had never dated anyone taller than me,” he says. “She’s an athlete, she’s a natural leader, and just an impressive person.”But Joel’s warm nature appealed to Shelley. She felt comfortable around him right away. They became close friends.“Joel has a really great sense of humor,” says Shelley. “I love that about him. And he just really has a sensitive heart to people, all people around him, he looks out for people.”“That really attracted me to him. And also, he used to have a nice dark head of hair. I really liked that too. But he has a very distinguished look now, and he’s just as handsome as ever.”About a year after they first met, Joel and Shelley were deployed abroad, together.That’s when they “kind of started dating,” as Joel puts it. While there wasn’t much opportunity to go on actual dates on active service, they bonded.“Conversations, talking about everything, basically,” says Shelley. “We really got to know each other’s heart that way. And I think it just made it clear that this is what we were supposed to do.”Back home in the US, the two “started officially dating.”“We just kind of knew that this was going to be it,” says Joel. “And within a few months, we got married.”Joel and Shelley became instructor Air Force pilots in Mississippi. Then, in the early 2000s, Shelley gave birth to the couple’s kids, two twins, a boy and a girl. Shelley left flying around this time, but she stayed in the military, working for the US Air National Guard.“I wanted to be at home,” says Shelley.The path to pregnancy wasn’t easy for the couple and Joel calls their kids a “huge blessing.”“We went through in vitro a couple of times,” he says. “It took a few years for us to actually get pregnant.”The family relocated back to Colorado and Joel transitioned from military flying to commercial flying, becoming a pilot with Southwest Airlines in 2006.Cut to 2021. The pandemic years were tough going for Joel and Shelley, emotionally speaking. While the couple stayed healthy, their kids were in their late teens and struggled with the upheaval. Plus, Covid was impacting the aviation industry, so Joel was flying less. Around this time, Shelley left her job at the National Guard. She and Joel were wholly focused on their family and their kids’ wellbeing.But in time, the pandemic waned and Joel started flying more regularly. Joel and Shelley’s kids graduated high school and started the next phase of their lives. It was a transitional period for the Atkinson family, and in turn, Shelley started considering her future.She found herself dreaming about flying. She hadn’t been behind the controls of a plane in over two decades, but she felt a call to return. She started wondering if, like Joel, she could become a commercial pilot.When Shelley voiced the idea to Joel, he was immediately enthusiastic.“I said, ‘Come fly with me,’” says Joel, joking “cue the music.”Then, by coincidence, later that day, Joel saw a social media post from his airline, Southwest, about a pilot who’d taken a two decade break to raise a family, then returned to flying.“She literally had the same story as me,” says Shelley.It felt like a sign. While Joel didn’t know this other pilot directly, he was able to reach out to her via his work network and pass on contact details to Shelley, who subsequently texted the other pilot, asking for guidance and advice. Then, with encouragement from her new friend – plus Joel’s wholehearted support – Shelley committed to returning to the skies full time.While Shelley had years of Air Force experience, she hadn’t flown airplanes for 20 years. She had had to hit the books, take additional tests and ensure her qualifications were up to speed.But before long Shelley was hired by SkyWest Airlines, flying regional jets. Then she joined Joel at Southwest in 2023.“It was crazy. It happened way faster than I thought it would. It’s been amazing,” says Shelley.“It was meant to be,” says Joel.Joel and Shelley credit their success as a co-pilot team to their nearly three decades of marriage, as well as years of co-parenting.“Raising two teenagers during Covid, I tell people that was a lot harder than what we’re doing now,” says Joel.Plus, the two met as colleagues – so they know how to balance commitment to a job with enjoying each other’s company.Still, as a married couple in the military, Joel and Shelley never flew in the same aircraft.“The military kind of frowns upon it,” says Joel. “It’s a little morbid, but they don’t want you to both go down in a plane crash.”No such guidelines exist in commercial aviation, and so once Shelley joined Southwest, she and Joel were able to work side by side. Joel’s seniority allows him to regularly bid for flights with Shelley. And the two find Joel’s years of commercial aviation experience pairs well with Shelley’s fresh take.“She looks to me and relies on me for the experience that I have. But I also know that she is a very sharp person, she just went through a lot of training. So her knowledge is fresh. And she also has that wisdom and judgment,” says Joel.Since the excitement of their first flight, Joel and Shelley tend not to “make a big deal” about being a husband and wife pilot duo – unless it’s preempted by their colleagues.“We wait for them to ask,” says Shelley. As the couple share the same last name, often crew members put two and two together.As Joel’s the more senior of the two, he often runs the pre-flight briefing. Sometimes he’ll end it with a quick, throwaway: “Yes, we’re married.”The crew usually “start laughing,” says Joel.When Joel and Shelley are taking off and landing, they’re focused on the job at hand. “It’s very technical,” says Joel. “We’re running checklists.”But when the airplane reaches cruising altitude, “there’s some downtime” and Joel and Shelley will make the most of it, talking through their thoughts on life, their kids, their future plans and everything else that’s on their mind.“It’s so great, because all the years that I was flying, and she was at home, anything I wanted to talk to her about when I’m up in the air, it had to wait,” says Joel. “You’re saving up conversations until you’re home. It’s like now we’re making up for lost time.”Then, when they land, Joel and Shelley make the most of the layovers. Southwest largely flies domestically, so the couple enjoy traveling the length and breadth of the US together.“It is a great job, because you go see different places and spend time in different cities,” says Joel, but before Shelley joined Southwest, Joel says layovers sometimes felt like “wasted time, because it was just me, and I couldn’t share it with her.”“But now we’re together when we’re on the road – it’s so fun. Because every night on the road, it’s a date night together,” he says.Now, instead of counting the days until he’s home, Joel says his “home is right here” because “she’s with me.”While Joel and Shelley have flown together countless times since Shelley joined Southwest, they’ve yet to fly with their kids in tow. That’s on the to-do list – plus, their son is also training to be a pilot, so there’s a chance Shelley and Joel might pilot an aircraft with him in the future.For Shelley, an additional perk of the last couple of years is her adult kids getting to “view her as a pilot for the first time.”Shelley and Joel’s children grew up knowing their parents met flying jets – but while they saw their father regularly piloting airplanes for Southwest, they never saw Shelley flying. Shelley is really happy her children get to see her doing a job she loves.Shelley’s also proud to be a female pilot in an industry that’s still very male-dominated. She hopes to inspire other people, especially mothers who may have taken a break from the workplace to raise a family, by demonstrating that returning to a passion is possible.“I hope it encourages other women that there is this opportunity out there – you can come back and you can still do it,” she says.Shelley says she’s really loved rediscovering her love of flying.“The view from 36,000 feet is pretty awesome,” she says. “Flying over parts of the country - I just love looking down and going, ‘Oh, what town is that?’”Shelley and Joel particularly enjoy flying in and out of San Diego, California, but they also love it when Southwest takes them to New York. Before Christmas, they enjoyed a stopover in New York City and went searching for the settings of their favorite movies, from “Elf” to “Serendipity.”“I love traveling, seeing new places,” says Joel, who adds that he’s gone from avoiding working weekends to voluntarily signing up for Saturday and Sunday flight shifts. He and Shelley now spend Saturday nights watching jazz in Portland, going on hikes in Sacramento or drinking cocktails in Palm Springs.Joel’s always loved flying – especially what he calls “the art and science” of aviation. He also loves “serving people, getting them to where they need to be,” but he admits flying during the pandemic was hard going. For Joel, having Shelley now by his side at work has “been just a complete turnaround.” Now even the ride to work is fun as the couple car share, coffees in hand.Joel and Shelley, who post about their adventures on their Instagram account @luvpilots, are currently planning to pick up a flight together on Valentine’s Day. Joel bought the two of them heart-printed ties especially – they’re “silly, but fun,” says Joel.The couple enjoy chronicling their travels on social media – celebrating their marriage, their respective careers and their adventures.“We feel blessed. We’re thankful for the opportunity,” says Joel. “We’re thankful to Southwest Airlines for letting us do this together.”“If you love doing something, why not do it with the person you love?” says Shelley."

        "title": "After risky spine surgery the surgeon told her not to plan any travel. Here’s what happened when she didn’t listen",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "As she prepared for a risky spine operation around 18 months after sustaining injuries in a horrific 2011 car accident that left her in constant pain, Pamela Holt made a promise to herself.Not only would she be able to travel again within six months, she would make it to 80 countries by the time she turned 50.Holt, who was in her mid-30s at the time, had already visited around 55 countries, but the severity of her injuries had put her life, and her travels on hold.Shortly after waking up from the successful surgery, Holt, originally from California, was so determined to take a solo backpacking trip to the Middle East that she asked her mother to call American Airlines to book her a plane ticket.“The surgeon thought I was insane to book something six months in advance,” Holt tells CNN Travel.“He said, ‘There’s just no way you’re going to do this. “I said, ‘Yes, there is. Let’s make it happen. So I have something to look forward to.”“Having that positive attitude, I think helped with the healing. Because I had been in pain for a year and a half and quite frankly, I was ready to drive myself off a cliff. It just wasn’t worth living in that kind of pain.”Thankfully, Holt was well enough to make that trip in July 2013, and spent time in Petra, Jordan, which she describes as an “eye opening experience.”“I really, really enjoyed Jordan, because they were so excited and so welcoming to me as an American,” she says. “And I wasn’t expecting that.”She explains that her love of travel began during her early teens, when she visited Hong Kong with her family and celebrated her birthday in the country.“I think that’s where I got the travel bug,” she says. “I looked around and thought, ‘I want to live outside the bubble that I grew up in.’”Holt went on to take her first solo trip at the age of 19, traveling to Japan, where she lived for several months.“I would travel on my own during the weekends,” she says. “And then I ended up living in Japan again about three or four years later.”Holt, who was able to travel extensively while working as an actress, soon developed an intense passion for solo travel.“It [her travels] was mostly through working,” she says. “But I had always made solo travel a priority.“I literally worked to travel.”Of course, her life changed forever after the car accident, which left her near immobilized, and she was advised to get her affairs in order before undergoing surgery.“Going through something so traumatic and life changing – not only the accident, but then that spine surgery, it’s really scary,” she says.“It kind of makes you stop and ask, ‘Am I living the life that I want to live?’ “And I knew that solo travel had been the biggest joy for me in the past.“And it just really became even more of a focal point in my life after that.”Once she returned from that trip to the Middle East, Holt was even more determined to achieve her goal of visiting 80 countries by her 50th birthday, taking the vast majority of the trips by herself.So what is it about solo travel that appeals to Holt so much?“I love the adrenaline, the freedom and the joy of solo traveling,” she says. “You get to meet new people everywhere you go.“You get to challenge yourself. Build self confidence. I sound like a billboard for slow travel, but it’s shaped who I am over the years.“And the more positive experiences I had as a solo traveler, the more I wanted to do it again.”Holt goes on to explain that, as she was single for a long time, she often didn’t have anyone to travel with.And during the times that she was able to travel with friends, she usually found that they had different ideas on how they wanted to spend their vacations.“Most of them wanted to shop and eat,” she explains. “And I wanted to explore and dive into history and literally walk past the next corner and then see something and get to the next corner.“I wanted to go beyond my comfort level.”Rather than rushing from destination to destination, Holt is a big fan of slow travel.When it comes to destinations most suitable for solo travelers, she recommends Thailand, Bali and Vietnam.“It [the Far East] is sort of the solo traveler Mecca,” she says. “I think that it’s the best place to go for a solo traveler that’s wanting some adventure.“But there’s [also] a really good core of resources for solo travelers. Places to stay. Tours. Stuff like that.”Holt points to the European country of Italy as another fantastic location for those who are going it alone.“The reason I love it so much is, one, there is so much to do,” she adds. “And you really can, in the most positive way, lose yourself in Italy and soak in the flavor.”While Holt had been due to book her first Broadway tour before the accident, she struggled to revive her career back on track afterwards.“Trying to rebuild myself after that car accident took a long time,” she says.She eventually came up with a concept that combined her love of solo travel with her entertainment background, TV series ‘Me, Myself & The World: The Art of Solo Travel,’ which Holt both hosts and executive produces.The second season of the travel series, available on Amazon Freevee and GoTraveler, sees Holt exploring the backstreets of both Hanoi, Vietnam and Bangkok, Thailand, while meeting and talking with locals, as well as other solo travelers.Holt says she’s often contacted by budding solo travelers, particularly women, who are keen to travel, but can’t quite build up the courage.She explains that she advises people to “start small” and take a day trip somewhere nearby, before working up to a bigger trip to somewhere further afield,“Get used to relying on yourself, and being comfortable with yourself,” she stresses. “Some people don’t ever want to go out to dinner with themselves.“But if you just keep doing it, you’re going to build that confidence and you’re going to learn how wonderful it is.”Holt points out that many older people seem to view solo travelers as “a group of backpackers in their 20s, or the 40-year-old woman who had a midlife crisis,” stressing that there are many different types of solo travelers.“I’ve redefined solo travel to an acronym of, Seeking Out Life’s Opportunities,” she adds. “That’s what solo is. You can still be a partner or spouse to someone.“You can still be single. You can be anything you want. It’s about seeking out life’s opportunities for yourself.”However, she cautions those who are new to solo traveling to accept that while they may meet wonderful people who are willing to help them along the way, they will be primarily depending on themselves, and should always trust their instincts.“The biggest challenge is trusting yourself,” she adds. “Trusting your gut. Paying attention to your instincts.“I see a lot of solo travelers make the mistake of being nice, and overriding their instincts, when they should pay attention to that first.“You can always be nice and always be courteous. But pay attention to your gut and what it’s telling you about people and about surroundings.“If you get sick, or you lose your wallet. You’re on your own. So you have to become hardy. If you weren’t hardy before, solo travel will teach you to be very hardy.”In the 15 years or so between her spinal surgery and her 50th birthday, Holt was able to fulfill that promise she made back when she was in hospital, and opted to celebrate in style, flying into Bhutan, her 80th country, on the big day in August 2019.“I wanted to do something epic,” she says. “Because, honestly, I didn’t want to be that poor 50-year-old woman who didn’t have a partner. So I created my own joy. And I had a terrific time on my golden jubilee.”While Holt is now married – she reconnected with Brodie, who she first met when she was 15, shortly after completing her “80 by 50” challenge and the pair tied the knot in 2022 – she has continued to travel alone and still has the same joy for solo travel.“He travels about one to five weeks a year [for work],” she says, explaining that her husband owns a company and also works as a volunteer golf coach. “So the last thing he wants to do is travel [again].”“If we can do one international trip [together] a year, great. But I am happy to solo travel for a long time. And he’s happy to let me go.”Reflecting on that bleak period after her accident, when the prospect of being able to go anywhere seemed almost inconceivable, Holt says she has a completely different outlook now.“I really live life to the fullest,” she adds. “I take more chances in life. Travel is my foundation and it is continuing to shape me. Every trip I take, I am more understanding of people.“More open to everything that’s going on in this world. Especially right now, I have a totally different perspective because I have a world perspective.”"

        "title": "How to survive a shark attack – or better yet, avoid one entirely",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "First things first: Despite some truly terrifying tales of survival, you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon.But sharks do occasionally attack humans – and they certainly make news when they do:• Rockaway Beach Park in Queens, New York, was closed to swimming and surfing on August 8, one day after a woman was hospitalized after suffering an apparent shark bite.• A teenager was bitten by a shark on the foot in early July as he was surfing off the coast of New York’s Fire Island.• A Russian citizen was killed by a shark in the Red Sea in Egypt on June 8.• A shark attacked a woman from Connecticut while she was snorkeling at a resort in Turks and Caicos on May 24.While these kinds of encounters understandably cause would-be ocean swimmers to worry, there’s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation. The chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low despite the headlines.The Florida Museum of Natural History’s International Shark Attack File found only 57 confirmed, unprovoked shark bites on people and 32 confirmed, provoked bites in 2022 worldwide.Think about it a minute – the world population is more than 8 billion people. Many of those live near or vacation at the coast. And only 89 bites were logged. Your chances of drowning are much, much higher.In 2022, the United States led the way in unprovoked attacks at 41; Florida had the highest state total at 16.That said, you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack, according to shark experts interviewed by CNN Travel.Know your environmentSharks are salt-water creatures. The ocean is their home; we are the visitors.“If you’re going to the ocean, you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is,” said Neil Hammerschlag, director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.“Fortunately, humans aren’t on the menu, and also fortunately, sharks tend to avoid people.”Still, there are places you’re more likely to encounter a shark.River mouths are not the best place to swimYou should avoid estuaries, said Richard Peirce, an author, shark expert and former chair of the UK-based Shark Trust and Shark Conservation Society.Their often-murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks, which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks.“An awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths, where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river – people washing their clothes, people washing themselves,” said Peirce.Hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely: deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out.Avoid areas with fishingBefore you jump in the sea, have a look around the horizon: What do you see? If you see fishing boats, Peirce says “forget it.”“Whether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational, material will often be being discarded, and unwanted dead fish, fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks,” he said.Before you go in, watch for unusual fish activity, such as a whole bunch of small- and medium-sized fish jumping out of the water, Hammerschlag said. That’s a possible sign a shark might be nearby.He also advised to not swim within roughly 50 yards of where someone is fishing from shore.Avoid dusk and dawnSwimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely, but it’s also the time when a shark attack is most likely.“A lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity,” Peirce says, “due to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark.”Hang with lifeguardsChris Lowe, professor in marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, advises to “do your homework” before you go into unfamiliar waters. Bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places.If you have any questions, ask a local lifeguard. He said they are a great resource.“I always recommend people go to guarded beaches. It’s a lot safer,” he said.Don’t wear shiny objects in the water“Be careful with jewelry, anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish.” Lowe said.In murky water, a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal. “And you don’t want your hand or foot to get confused with that.”Follow your instincts“Probably the most important thing is to follow your gut,” Hammerschlag said. “If you feel wary about getting in the water … just don’t go in the water.”“A lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that, like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn’t listen to it,” he said.Don’t panicSo you’re being circled by a shark. The worst thing you can do right now is panic.“Don’t start splashing around – you’re just going to excite, incite and encourage the shark’s interest,” said Peirce.Humans, apes, dogs and cats all have paws and hands. If we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it, we feel it, we put it to our nose.“A shark has got no paws or hands, so if it wants to explore something, the only capability it’s got to do that is to put it in its mouth,” said Peirce.“That’s why we often get exploratory bites which don’t result in death and sometimes don’t even result in serious injury. If you go swimming and splashing away, you’re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite.”Maintain eye contactAs the shark swims around you, keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact.“Sharks are ambush predators,” Peirce explained. “If you’re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you, it’s not going to be half as comfortable as if it’s able to sneak up from behind.”Hammerschlag concurred, saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you’re following it. Then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore.If you’re surfing, track the shark with your board, Lowe said. “Let the shark know it’s being watched.”Marine biologists and shark divers Adriana Fragola and Kayleigh Grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks. In a viral TikTok video (see top of story), the shark is seen as Fragola splashes away, capturing its attention. She turns around, faces the approaching shark, remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand.“You’re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you,” Fragola says in the video.Stay big or get smallThis is where it gets complicated. If a shark is clearly in attack mode, you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water, according to Peirce.“The bigger you are in the water, the more respect you’ll get,” he said.But if the shark seems to simply be passing through, Peirce’s advice is to roll up into a ball.“If a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source, that can be one reason it attacks you,” he explained.“If I didn’t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor – and if it wasn’t showing massive interest in me – I would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me.”Don’t play deadThis isn’t a bear, it’s a shark. If you find yourself in an aggressive encounter, give it hell: punch, kick and poke at sensitive spots – but be careful where you aim.“There’s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose. That’s OK, but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth,” said Peirce.“This is a moving object in the water and you’re not staying still either, so what you don’t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it.”A good shot to the gills can also do the job: “The gills are very sensitive – giving a shark a whack in the gills isn’t a bad idea.”Are you carrying anything with you? If so, turn it into a weapon.“If you’re a diver with an underwater camera, use it, if you’re a snorkeler, rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark,” Peirce says.“I’ve had a lot of sharks come at me, and it’s (been) enough to use a shark billy – a small metal rod between two and three feet long – and I’ve just given them a little nudge on their nose.”It’s a good idea to swim with other people, Lowe said. Not only does that decrease the chances of an attack, he said, but you’ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten.Cut off the anglesIf you’re a diver and you run into trouble, try to get into a position where the shark can’t get behind you, says Peirce.“Keep your back to something like a coral reef. Then you’ve only got one direction to look. You’re protected from behind, for example, and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is.”Slowly back awayDisplace the least amount of water possible. Try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore.“You must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water. Again, you’ve got to be careful – large sharks can attack in very shallow depths.”Doing the above may help to a degree, but Peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim.“If a white shark is in full attack mode, there’s not much you’re going to be able to do at that point,” he says."

        "title": "‘Black is beautiful’: Why Nigerians think their Guinness is better than Ireland’s",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Femi Oyebade, a Nigerian diasporan for more than 30 years and a Guinness beer connoisseur, assures me that there is a stark difference between Irish Guinness and Nigerian Guinness. Chalk and cheese won’t suffice in defining the distance between the two.Nigerian Guinness has weight in your mouth and is sumptuously smooth. It isn’t as bitter as Irish Guinness and has a lovelier, frothier head. Its sugar content is higher. So, Oyebade tells me, for health reasons a drinker should reduce their intake of pounded yam and other “swallow”-carbs to accommodate the extra blood sugar.The alcohol content of Nigerian Guinness is 7.5%, almost twice as strong as the Irish 4.2%. Oyebade insists you can never drink Nigerian Foreign Extra Import and go back to Dublin dry stout. Never, ever. America, where Nigeria’s Foreign Extra Import Guinness is not typically available, is worse off for its absence.I found these arguments fascinating, especially because my love of Guinness beer is based on its bitter-sweet malted aromatics and their potential as a cooking ingredient.I bake stout and apple wheaten bread regularly with an overdose of Nigerian Foreign Extra Import, switching buttermilk for stout.I slow-cook stewing beef in three-quarters of a can with carrots, leeks, dried Cameroonian peppers and honey.But I can’t drink it. I’m a philistine whose appreciation of the beverage really starts and ends with pleasurable inhalation of the fragrance of cooking Guinness. I suppose that is also a kind of sensory imbibing that can leave you “happy.” There is something about Guinness’s distinct aromatics that hits the spot.How do you drink your stout? It’s an easy question in Nigeria. The intensely dark, bitter, creamy, deliciously frothy-headed elixir with an intoxicating bouquet is democratically drunk all over the country by all.That’s everyone from lactating mothers, perilously sipping thanks to the original Nigerian Guinness adverts from the 1960s that proclaim “Guinness gives you power” and “Guinness is good for you,” to the octogenarian at death’s door terrified of hospitals and sure Guinness cures all ails.Nigeria is the second largest Guinness-drinking nation worldwide. We drink more Guinness than the Irish. And we were the first Guinness-brewing outpost of note, with a representative brew – not barley but maize, sorghum and a unique yeast – created for our national palate.There is a scientific postscript for Femi Oyebade’s avowal of our Guinness’ superiority. It was purposefully tailored to our taste buds using grains that we grow locally and eat every day.The adroit advertising from the 1960s – “Black is Beautiful”– helped Guinness cross firmly from cultural émigré to Nigerian indigene decades ago.In other words, the Guinness brew pretended that it was one of us (Black, beautiful and strong). It attested to how we saw ourselves and plugged into our national identity and we forgot that it was imported.The Foreign Extra Import – our own export of the Nigerian brew – can be found sitting on the shelf (in a 33-centiliter bottle) in every good London corner shop, you just have to know to ask.It’s an efficient identifier. If you say to the man behind the counter “Foreign… Extra… Import,” he will stake his life that you are Nigerian. Our brew is apparently “less” bitter, and roasted darker, than the original Irish Guinness Draught in a can or pub-poured pint glass.We drink differently too.Because it has been many years since I was back in Nigeria, I turned to Nigerian poet, writer, psychiatrist and friend Dami Ajayi for help with beer parlor nostalgiaAjayi tells me there used to be a beer parlour at “Yaba Left” – the informal name of the federal neuropsychiatric hospital in Yaba, Lagos.It was a purpose-built building situated in the old railway compound. The upper floor, called the social center, was forsaken and unhappy but there was a kitchen downstairs rented out to a catfish and pepper soup vendor with a gold tooth.At 4 p.m. every day, the plastic tables and chairs – branded with the beers Gulder, Trophy, Goldberg and so on – would appear in the compound of the building and men would start to fill them.They were rarely alone – no, they were accompanied by women (notably not their wives). The clientele was mostly “bring our girlfriend for fish” men, between 40 and 50 years old, with women half their age. Doctors from the psychiatric hospital and people visiting patients were also part of the gatherings.Outside the perimeter of the building were stalls – Aunty Toyin selling peppered snails and yam, Shehu, the suya smoked meat man with his speciality “tozo suya” beef and someone else selling noodles and eggs.The beer parlor closed at 11 p.m. and people who lived and worked in the area would drink their beer, their Guinness, eat their suya or pepper soup, talk about politics and other affairs, and go home or move on to the guest house nearby.In summary, meat, stout and an essential playlist of classics like Chief Commander Ebenezer Obey’s “The Horse, the Man and his Son,” or “Ero Mi Ko Lonso,”Tunde Nightingale and his Highlife Boys’ “The Bird That Sings All the Night,” Ayinla Omowura’s “Awa Ki ise Olodi Won,” and Dr. Victor Olaiya’s languid crooning of “Baby Jowo.”Sometime in the mid-2010s, there was a Friday night live band. The social center was created with the singular goal of removing the stigma of the psychiatric hospital’s presence in the community.Until its demolition years later, it never achieved its goal. The memory of the beer parlour remains indelible as the place nearby to unwind and drink your “Odeku.”We don’t bother with grandiose descriptive words. Guinness is Guinness. Or it is a big stout, Odeku (60 centiliters), or a small stout, Lanko (33 centiliters). Lanko is so named because it sounds like “lanky” and Odeku sounds like an onomatopoeic neologism for someone stocky and strong.It says something about the ubiquitousness of Guinness in Nigeria that our words for the drink have transcended the division of 500 languages and become big vs small, Odeku vs Lanko. The size of the Guinness beer bottle you buy for a friend or new acquaintance points to how highly you esteem them. There is no middle ground where this is concerned.A demand to the server, “Give him an Odeku,” is flattery plus flourish. An Odeku is twice the esteem of a Lanko or a Heineken. A Nigerian man flirting with a woman won’t buy her a big bottle of Guinness in a beer parlor; he will buy her a Lanko with a glass. But then, of course she can drink as many Lankos as she likes – enough to equal the Odekus – because the protocols of respectful courting have already been observed.In 1992, Nigerian Breweries attempted to create a new brew to rival Guinness and came up with Legend Extra Stout. It contains the eluded barley with sorghum and caramel, but more than 30 years later it has still failed to topple Guinness from its throne.The Guinness brewery in Lagos is almost as old as Nigerian independence, having been brewing Guinness Foreign Extra Stout since 1963 – just three years after the country became independent from the UK.Femi Oyebade speaks for many when he says there is no match for Nigerian Guinness in smoothness or cultured mouth-feel – not even close.My own favourite excuse for “drinking” stout isn’t anything to do with old wives’ tales masquerading as medical therapy nor winding down at the weekend. It is back to the Irish beef and Guinness stew with plenty of hot pepper to suit my Nigerian palate.A good-size filet is the ideal cut. The meat is cut up in generous chunks and browned in vegetable oil in a pan. When it has a good glaze, I put it in a bowl and set it aside. I then fry two chopped-up onions, two large carrots cut up in big pieces and one finely chopped leek in the same oil that I browned the meat in. This deglazes the pan and helps the amalgamation of the meat and vegetable flavors.I then put my meat back in with the vegetables and add about a handful of flour; three quarters (or more) of a can of Guinness Foreign Extra Import; salt; lots of ground-dried Cameroonian pepper and about one-and-a-half to two tablespoons of honey. A little bit of water also helps.The dish is covered and left in the oven on a low setting to cook to absolutely delicious perfection; an hour is certainly not too long.The smell of cooking onions, carrots, meat and stout is indescribable. The “plenty pepper” lifts it out of the melancholy of a London gray sky; helps it to hit that spot. The cooked carrots melt in the mouth oozing the juices of beef and malt. Beef and stout stew tastes so much better the next day. I serve it simply with steamed aged rice."

        "title": "France’s favorite cheese is facing an ‘extinction’ crisis. Not everyone is worried",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "When Napoleon first encountered a Camembert cheese, legend has it, he was so delighted he kissed the waitress who plonked it in front of him. Setting aside the inappropriateness of this gesture, the French emperor clearly recognized a winner.Produced in France’s northwestern region of Normandy in various forms since at least the 18th century, the cheese - creamy, pungent and gooey - is now regarded as France’s favorite.Which is why recent headlines about Camembert’s imminent death due to a fungal crisis have caused panic among fans of this historic fromage. Scientists, it seems, have warned that problems with French cheese’s industrial production may have long-term consequences for its future.Alarm was raised in January when a recent study by scientists at Paris-Saclay University identified that the main fungus used in creating Camembert and other cheeses was increasingly in short supply due to the industrial production methods used to keep up with demand.And while that might spell trouble for a variety of dairy offerings, some have taken this to mean that poor Camembert – which is handily sold in its own wooden box – is headed for the grave.“Blue cheeses may be under threat, but the situation is much worse for Camembert, which is already on the verge of extinction,” the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) said in its report about the findings. Elsewhere, another headline warned of a looming “cheese crisis,” adding, “say a prayer for Camembert!”The cheese stakes couldn’t be higher. Alongside the Louvre, haute couture and the Eiffel Tower, Camembert is a national treasure beloved the world over – as existential to the French as existentialism.“What’s the typical image of France? A bottle of red wine, a baguette and a Camembert,” says Anne-Marie Cantin, a veteran cheesemonger and president judge of the 2023 French national Camembert competition. “It’s our national cheese.”At the heart of the problem is Penicillium camemberti, a fungus used in cheesemaking that gives Camembert its white rind and helps develop both the cheese’s rich buttery umami flavor and its palpable aroma of unwashed socks.P. camemberti is, say the Paris-Saclay scientists, experiencing problems reproducing, largely as a result of the pressures of industrial production. Not so much performance anxiety per se, but the consequence of an asexual fungal cultivation process that, due to an extreme lack of genetic diversity, is running on empty.Camembert, and similar cheeses like Brie, were once aged in caves or hâloirs (drying rooms), where naturally occurring mold spores gave them blue or sometimes yellow-brown rinds. At the turn of the last century, Penicillium camemberti was introduced, replacing the indigenous mold and creating the uniform white rinds we know today.“It is thought to be a white mutant selected from the gray-green species Penicillium commune for its color at the start of the 20th century,” the Paris-Saclay study said.Unfortunately, unlike its cave-dwelling fungal counterparts, researchers found that Penicillium camemberti has a very low genetic diversity and declined capacity to reproduce sexually.“Our findings raise questions about the use of limited number of clonal strains for cheese making, which tends to lead to degeneration, limiting the possibilities for further improvement,” the study said.That, according to the CNRS report, means “it is now very difficult for manufacturers to obtain sufficient quantities of P. camemberti spores to inoculate their Normandy cheese production.”It’s not the first time Camembert has faced a crisis following the introduction of P. camemberti. According to the late Patrick Lance, a British cheese expert who authored a definitive guide to France’s cheese, the industrialization and conflict of the last century almost saw it wiped out.“Two world wars and too much big business nearly brought Camembert to its grave, except in name,” he wrote in his definitive 1989 tome “The French Cheese Book.”“And this name has been brought into contempt by failure to protect it against the masses of pasteurised factory distortions of the formula, perpetrated over almost all of France and abroad.To the rescue, in 1982, came Appellation d’origine protégée (AOP) status, which meant only cheeses made in Normandy could carry the Camembert name. That didn’t, however, stop further tussles over whether true Camembert should be made with raw or pasteurized milk.Those who have experienced the past rises and falls of Camembert seem to be taking the cheese’s latest problem in their stride.“My family has been making Camembert since 1891, five generations… I have never heard of this situation before,” Bruno Lefèvre, director general of Les fromageries de Normandie, a regional cheesemakers’ association, told CNN.“It is true that cheesemakers have fought battles against the cheese that didn’t have a white appearance,” Lefèvre said, adding that the first batches of Camembert his father made, more than 50 years ago, were “blue, white and red.”But from his understanding, the color difference is a result of bacterial pigmentation.“It’s linked to this type of bacterium called Brevibacterium linens, which has the ability to form an orange pigment. It is by no means a result of fungus activity,” Lefèvre said.France is currently hosting its annual cheese fair in Paris, gathering major cheesemakers from across the country. Naturally, fading fungus has been a much-discussed topic. Lefèvre said that people he has spoken with were confused about where the fear for Camembert’s future was coming from.“I have made all kinds of Camembert, from more traditional ones to the more industrial ones, I have never encountered issues with my fungus,” Lefèvre said.“This study has been widely reported by the media. Maybe the researchers were trying to make us cheesemakers panic, but so far they have not succeeded,” he added.While the scientists have stood by their claims, they stress that there’s no danger that Camembert is vanishing anytime soon. “We always make it clear to journalists that there is no short-term danger to Camembert production,” researcher Tatiana Giraud told CNN. “What our articles say is that there is a great homogenization of starters and that this reduces their ability to adapt, nothing more.”Of course, keeping Camembert alive also means that the cheese’s story is also kept alive. Supposedly, it was first created by a Normandy woman called Marie Harel who picked up tips from a fugitive priest from Brie, another bastion of French cheesemaking. After finding favor with Napoleon, it went on to play an unexpected role in World War I, which was commemorated with a statue.The monument to Harel in the Normandy town of Vimoutiers, was actually first built by an American, according to Camembert expert Anne-Marie Cantin.“An American doctor first came to Normandy after the First World War asking to find the tomb of Marie Harel and later build a statue for her,” she said.“To the surprise of locals, who had struggled to find someone who can speak English, he explained that he had used Camembert during the war to cure patients and wanted to come and thank the inventor.”That statue was later destroyed in 1944 by American bombing during the Normandy landings and it was a group of cheese factory workers from Ohio who made a donation to build a new one after the war, according to Cantin.The statue is still standing proudly today in the town square of Vimoutiers in Normandy, with a plaque marking that it is a gift offered by “400 men and women making cheese in Van Wert, Ohio, USA.”Another statue of Marie Harel stands back in Van Wert County Museum in Ohio, quietly marking an extraordinary and cheesy relationship between France and the United States."

        "title": "Irish names you’re probably saying wrong and how to pronounce them",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Do you know your Gearóid from your Gobnait? Your Fearghal from your Muirgheal?To the untrained eye, Irish names can seem like a daunting ambush of rogue consonants and surprise vowels.That’s because while the Irish language uses the same Latin alphabet letters as English, they represent different sounds and have different spelling rules.Here’s a guide, with audio clips, on how to pronounce some common Irish names. We also have some Irish language hacks so you can figure out names yourself.Read on to find out why Sinéad starts with “Shin,” how a “h” can turn a “b” into a “v,” and why you’ll never hear “St Patty’s Day” said in Ireland.To help navigate the minefield, CNN has called in help from Irish language and culture expert Darach Ó Séaghdha, author of the books “Motherfoclóir” and “Craic Baby.”So if you see “Oppenheimer” star Cillian Murphy in the street and want to congratulate him on the Oscar win, the first thing to remember is that there’s no K in the traditional Irish alphabet.When you see an Irish name beginning with C, it’s always a hard C, Ó Séaghdha explains. So Cillian is “Kill-ee-an.” The Germanized version, Killian, used to be the dominant spelling in Ireland, says Ó Séaghdha, but in 2003 – the year after Murphy’s breakthrough movie “28 Days Later” was released – the C spelling took over and has reigned supreme ever since.That same C rule goes for the boys’ names Cían (Kee-an), Ciarán (Keer-awn) and – here you need to forget everything you learned from the US singer of the same name – the girl’s name Ciara (Keer-ah).If you’re familiar with Irish actor Saoirse “rhymes with inertia” Ronan, our pronunciation might seem like a curveball. But here’s another hard rule: expect the unexpected.There are three Irish dialects – Connacht, Munster and Ulster – and the way names sound often varies with regions and accents. Our audio clips are with a northeast accent, influenced by Ulster Irish, so might not sound exactly as you’ve heard the names said before.Typically a girl’s name, Saoirse, meaning “freedom,” first became popular in the newly independent Ireland of the 1920s and has most commonly been pronounced “Sorsha” or “Seersha.” Saoirse Ronan’s twist on it is “partly her accent,” reckons Ó Séaghdha, but it’s already fast on its way to becoming a new dominant pronunciation.So if you’re not sure how someone says their name, just ask.That apostrophe you see on the O of Irish surnames is an Anglicization of a “síneadh fada,” an acute accent slanting to the right. A fada above a vowel means the vowel should be pronounced “long” – which is what fada means in Irish.Fadas are often dropped in English, but in Irish pronunciation they are crucial. Take the first name of Irish-American talk show host Conan O’Brian. When anglicized it’s “Co-nin,” but with native pronunciation Conán is “Co-Nawn.” Likewise with Ronan (Ro-Nin) and Rónán (Ro-Nawn) - which, incidentally, means “baby seal.” Aww.Éabha is pronounced with a long E and sounds similar to the name “Ava,” but it’s actually “the way Eve is spelled in the Irish language Bible,” says Ó Séaghdha.And why is that bh pronounced like a V? We’ll get to that soon.The most famous Siobhán in modern times is Shiv from the TV show “Succession,” played by Australian actor Sarah Snook, but how does Siobh become “Shiv”? Ó Séaghdha – whose full name, if you’ve been wondering, is pronounced Da-rach (rhymes with Bach) O Shay – explains.“In Irish, you’ve got broad vowels and narrow vowels. When an S is next to a broad vowel like an A or an O, it sounds like ‘Sss,’ but when it’s next to a narrow one like I, it’s ‘Sh.’” It’s called the “caol le caol” rule.The name Sean has a fada when written in Irish – Seán (Shawn) - which is why the endings of Seán and Siobhán rhyme with “lawn” and not “can.” Another example is Aisling – meaning “dream” - which is pronounced Ashling (and sometimes spelled that way too).You’re still wondering about that bh, aren’t you? Okay, we’ll explain.Because fadas are dropped in English, Ó Séaghdha says a quick hack is often to “look at the Hs. If a h comes after another consonant, it’s usually softening it. ‘Bh’ and ‘mh’ are often treated like a single letter and pronounced ‘v’.” Hence - drumroll, please - Siobhán.The alarming gaggle of letters above is one of Ireland’s oldest girl’s names and has more variants than it has consonants. It can be Medb, Méabh or Méibh, but Maeve is the closest to English phonetics – it rhymes with “wave.”Let’s give it up now with a bualadh bos (“boola bus” – round of applause) for the girls’ names Dearbhla (Dervla), Aoibheann (Aveen), Caoimhe (Queeva or Keeva), Sadhbh (Sive), Ailbhe (Alva) and Niamh (Neeve).This masculine name was once so ubiquitous that it became an ethnic slur for Irish people (and, as “Taig,” for Northern Irish Catholics), in the same manner as “Paddy” or “Mick.”The g is clearly heard in Tadhgh, but, depending on the consonants around it, the “g” in “gh” might not be heard at all. Take Bronagh (Bro-nah) or Oonagh (anglicised as Una), for example.The presence of the “h” also assists the disappearing act done on the “d” in Odhrán (Or-awn) and the “m” in Domhnall (Do-nal).“Saltburn” star Barry Keoghan is yet another Irish actor making waves in Hollywood right now, but his pronunciation of his surname isn’t the standard form. His name is said “Barry Kyo-Gann’ with a hard “g,” but typically this name would sound more like “Kyo-ann.”Says Ó Séaghdha, “It’s a lot like the ‘gh’ in ‘through’ in English. If you can get your head around the ‘gh’ in ‘through’ in English, you can get your head around the one in Irish.”Here’s another one where the “d” takes a day off. The girl’s name Fiadh (Fee-ah) is perhaps “the biggest Irish name of the 21st century,” says Ó Séaghdha. It was the second most popular girl’s name in Ireland in 2023, after Grace.“In the late 20th century, popular Irish names tended to come from mythology – Deirdre, Niamh, Oisín and Gráinne – but in the 21st century there’s been a shift towards adjectives” and nouns, he says. Fiadh means “grace and wildness” while Rían (Ree-an) – the fourth most popular boy’s name in Ireland last year – means “kingly.”Says Ó Séaghdha, “There’s been a vibe shift in the kind of Irish names people are picking.”Oh, and this is as good a time as any to mention that the name for the Irish language is “Irish” or – in the language itself – “gaelige” (the pronunciation varies by dialect). If you want to impress your Irish pals, don’t call it Gaelic.Here’s one with some regional variation. The boy’s name Oisín and the girl’s name Róisín are Ush-een and Rush-een in most parts of the country, but O-sheen and Ro-sheen in others. When a fada appears over an i at the end of a name, it always sounds like “een.”Witness the transformative power of the fada in the Irish version of the name Maureen: Máirín. They’re pronounced exactly the same. See also Máire and its anglicised forms Maura and Moira.A fada on the girl’s name Áine turns it into “On-ya” and the feminine moniker Gráinne (Grawn-ya) also undergoes a similar transformation.Take a deep breath, don’t panic, you can do this. Caoilfhionn is simply “Keel-an.”“The ‘fh’ is the very hardcore version” of this unisex name, says Ó Séaghdha. As the “fh” isn’t pronounced, “it’s often spelled Keelan because the Irish language version terrifies. “They’ve seen the ‘gh’ before but then an ‘fh’ sounds bananas.”Variants of Caoilfhionn include Caolán, Caoileann, Kealan and many more. There are a few reasons for all this wide variation in Irish spelling, says Ó Séaghdha. One is that “often those names were popular before people knew how to spell. A relatively old name like Meadhbh would have different versions because people spell it different ways.”Another reason is that “there were different stages of spelling normalization in the Irish language. In the 1950s, they decided to kind of modernize the alphabet.” That’s when a lot of simplified, anglicized spellings took off.Finally, Ireland is an English-speaking country where only a small minority claims to speak its native language “very well.” So, says Ó Séaghdha, “Another part of it is, yeah, people just having a go.”See that D right there? That’s why you should never call it St. Patty’s Day. Pádraig (pronounced Paw-rig or Pawd-rig) is the Irish version of the anglicized name Patrick. Its many variants and diminutives include Pádraic, Pádhraig, Páidín and Páidí (Paddy).Patrick is often shortened to the anglicized Pat or –- going back to those Irish roots – Paddy. Patty is never to be heard. So in Ireland, the holiday is St. Patrick’s Day, Paddy’s Day, or nothing.Oh and those names at the start of the story? Hopefully we’ve given you some tools to make a fair stab at them by now, but a wise gaeilgeoir (“gwale-gore” – Irish-speaker) never assumes. They are, of course, Gearóid (Ger-ode – pronunciations vary), Gobnait (Gobnit), Fearghal (Fergal) and Muirgheal (Mur-yal)."

While the cost of living is spiraling and hitting groceries and other everyday costs hard, the price of plane tickets is at a 15-year low – in the United States, at least. Travel expert Katy Nastro tells CNN Business that average airfare is nearly a quarter less than it was prepandemic, and in fact, “hasn’t been this cheap since 2009.”This is the first full “normal” year of travel since Covid rocked our world, and while Nastro doesn’t expect prices to skyrocket anytime soon, she does sound one note of warning.“The single biggest factor for why we see cheap flights is competition,” says Nastro. “We want (budget) carriers in the mix because it actually places downward pressure on the legacy carriers” and keeps prices down. Airline mergers could affect that, meaning less competition and, potentially, higher fares.

        "title": "He thought the guy he met on vacation was just a fling. He turned out to be the love of his life",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Guillermo Barrantes relationship with Larry Mock was supposed to begin and end in Palm Springs.It was a “casual, brief encounter.” A vacation dalliance that only lasted half a day.“It was just so casual, so easily nothing could have happened from it,” Guillermo tells CNN Travel. “We could have walked away and just had our lives separate. But of course that didn’t happen, because it wasn’t meant to be that way. It was meant to be the way that it was. That it is.”It all started in summer 2013. Guillermo - then in his early 40s - was on vacation in the California resort city of Palm Springs. He was in a phase of life where, he says, he was prioritizing himself, and wasn’t interested in long term romance.“I thrived in being by myself, in traveling by myself, in having dinner by myself – I loved all of that so much,” says Guillermo, who lived in Boston, Massachusetts at the time.“I wanted no commitment, I wanted no emotional entanglement of any kind. I wanted to have fun, get to know myself. And it was in that mode that I met Larry, when I wasn’t really looking.”During the vacation in Palm Springs, Guillermo was staying at a friend’s apartment, and while the friend worked during the day, Guillermo passed his time at a “run-down, no-frills” resort a couple of blocks away.“You could just pay for a day pass, they’d give you a towel, and you could be in the pool and use their bar,” he recalls.One day, as he was walking the palm tree-lined streets to the resort, Guillermo swiped right on a guy on a dating app – Larry Mock, mid-40s, friendly smile. The two men exchanged a few messages back and forth. Larry said he was also on vacation in Palm Springs, staying in the resort Guillermo kept frequenting.They arranged to meet there for a drink by the pool. Guillermo was looking forward to meeting Larry, expecting “some casual fun.”Then, when Guillermo and Larry met, there was “chemistry” right away. Guillermo calls their connection “magnetic.”“My impression of Larry: sexy, handsome and warm,” he recalls.Larry was a Texas-based American Airlines flight attendant who’d booked the vacation to Palm Springs at the last minute. He’d recently broken up with a long-term partner but due to lease and budget reasons the two were still living together – awkwardly – in Dallas, Texas.Larry’s workdays were spent traveling the world. But during his downtime, he struggled to relax in the apartment with his ex, and this sentiment motivated the spontaneous vacation.“I needed to get out of town for the weekend, because we were just butting heads badly at that time,” Larry tells CNN Travel today.Larry searched his airline’s database, looking at destinations he could visit using the last minute, standby flight tickets available for flight attendants.“Palm Springs had seats, so I booked my standby flight, got to Palm Springs, checked into this resort. And that’s where Guillermo came into the picture,” says Larry.Larry was instantly attracted to Guillermo. He thought he was “just the most handsome guy” he’d ever seen.And as they got chatting, and Guillermo kept making Larry laugh, Larry sketched out his first impression to include two more adjectives: “so funny, and so kind.”In passing, as the two flirted over pool-side cocktails, Larry mentioned that he was a flight attendant.Guillermo lit up. In fact, his response was “giddy,” as Larry recalls it.“He started asking me tons of questions about planes, and flight attendants, and the routes and all of that kind of stuff.”“I’m a huge aviation geek,” explains Guillermo. As a kid growing up in Costa Rica, he’d wanted to be a pilot. Instead, he ended up working as an IT consultant. And while he says he was good at that job, liked it well enough and made good money – he still dreamed about working in aviation. Meeting a flight attendant was fascinating.“I was immediately drawn to his career,” says Guillermo.Larry found Guillermo’s enthusiasm for aviation charming, and happily answered his questions.Later that evening, Larry and Guillermo said their goodbyes, with no plans to meet again.“I was glad to meet him,” says Larry. “But I was like, ‘There’s no way I am going to pursue dating somebody that lived in Boston.’ And I still was dealing with what I was dealing with in Dallas.”“We just really enjoyed the time that we had together,” says Guillermo. “But we went our separate ways.”Almost without realizing – and certainly without intending to – Guillermo and Larry stayed in touch.“We kept chatting, we kept texting,” says Guillermo.Then, a few days after meeting Larry, Guillermo got an unexpected phone call from his mother in Costa Rica. He was still in Palm Springs at the time.“She said, ‘I don’t want you to freak out, but I just got diagnosed with breast cancer. I don’t want you to change the trip.’”Guillermo tried to protest, but his mother insisted he should enjoy the rest of his vacation. She reassured him that her sisters and Guillermo’s father were taking care of her, and she’d see Guillermo later in the month – he already had a trip to Costa Rica scheduled for that summer.Not wanting to go against his mother’s wishes, Guillermo stayed put in the desert. He tried to “compartmentalize” the news, but he was really close to his mom, and it was cataclysmic.Later, back home in Boston, Guillermo found himself sharing his mother’s news with Larry, and confiding in him about his fears and worries. He added that his mother lived in Costa Rica, so he’d likely be flying back and forth for the rest of the year.Larry was supportive, empathetic – and he told Guillermo that he should use the discounted flights Larry got through work.Guillermo was taken aback – it was “such a sweet gesture” from someone who was basically a stranger. But then, somehow, Larry already felt much more than that.“Very early on, he and I had just beautiful interactions, and it revealed the kind of person that he was,” he says.And so, rather than dwindling, Larry and Guillermo’s communication increased as the days rolled on.“Within just a few weeks, we just knew – without much discussion, without talking about it – we just knew that there was a very, very strong connection there,” says Guillermo.“We always had something to talk about,” says Larry.Larry was still hesitant about jumping into something new, following the breakdown of his previous relationship. But the messages back and forth with Guillermo became a highlight of his day. And as time passed, he found himself opening up to Guillermo, confiding in him.“After a few months, I was like, ‘Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for my whole life. Someone that I can be my authentic self with,’” says Larry.In September 2013, two months after their Palm Springs meeting, Larry arranged to visit Guillermo in Boston.At Logan Airport, Larry came down the escalator and spotted Guillermo’s face in the crowd. He was beaming, and started running towards Larry.Then, Guillermo “hugged me so hard,” recalls Larry.He remembers thinking, “Oh my god, this is the one.”Then Guillermo and Larry went to Boston’s seaport district together, and found a sundrenched rooftop bar where they sat drinking beers.“We could see the planes approaching Logan, and it was just a sunny and perfect Boston day,” recalls Guillermo. “I remember that, like a picture, sitting by the edge – I remember the beer and I remember the planes.”It was “magical,” says Guillermo, but also slightly “surreal.”The Palm Springs encounter was so brief. He never thought he’d see Larry again. And now here Larry was, sitting opposite him, in Guillermo’s city.From there, Guillermo and Larry started dating cross-country.They took advantage of Larry’s discounted flights. Sometimes Larry traveled to Boston, but usually Guillermo visited Larry in Dallas. Guillermo’s love of flying meant that, for him, the four-hour journey across the country was part of the fun.“I was in heaven,” he says. “Just the fact that I was getting to do something that I have always just loved - which is being on an airplane and going somewhere.”Each Friday, as he packed his bag and headed to the airport, Guillermo would also be struck with “excitement” at the thought of seeing Larry.And during these weekend visits, Guillermo and Larry grew accustomed to each other’s habits, how they moved through their days, how they liked to spend their time. Guillermo got to know Larry’s friends and got to know Dallas as a city. They spoke about their hopes, dreams, ambitions and families.Guillermo says it was obvious that they were “very aligned on the important aspects of life: how we view finances, closeness with families, politically and world views and enjoyment of the small things in life.”Larry supported Guillermo as he cared for his mother through her cancer, and celebrated with him when she recovered.“For us, it was a gradual process of falling in love,” says Guillermo. “But a theme for us in our life together is that everything felt right and natural.”“We can’t pinpoint the moment, but we simply knew very deep in our hearts that we found the life partner.”“That made me so happy,” says Larry.For Guillermo, moving to Dallas two years later, in late 2015, was “just as the easiest decision.”Larry was thrilled. His Dallas-based friendship group had already welcomed Guillermo into the fold, and his parents were happy for him too.“I introduced Guillermo to everybody,” says Larry. “My family’s always been very accepting of me.”Guillermo’s family situation was more complicated. He’s always been very close with his parents and siblings, but for the first two decades of his adult life, he didn’t talk to his family about relationships.“My personal life was not necessarily an open book,” Guillermo says. “Love has never been the question - my parents love me, I love my parents and my sisters, we all get along great. But there was always that invisible barrier, which was: I don’t talk about my personal relationships.”But Guillermo didn’t want to hide Larry from anyone - he felt he owed that to himself, and to Larry.“I wasn’t going to edit myself, I wasn’t going to filter. I just knew deep in my heart that it was my chance to be able to truly be myself,” he says.So Guillermo started peppering his phone calls home with mentions of Larry. He uploaded cute photos of the two of them to social media.“I’m fearless,” he told himself. “Nothing bad can happen here.”Cut to 2018, which was a monumental year for Guillermo and Larry for a couple of reasons. For one, it was the year Guillermo followed in Larry’s footsteps and became a flight attendant.It was a mutual friend who suggested Guillermo should give it a shot, and Larry – who’d spent years listening to Guillermo wax lyrical about airplanes – was wholeheartedly encouraging.Guillermo applied to Larry’s airline, American Airlines, but wasn’t accepted. But then he applied to Delta, and was accepted on the spot.While Guillermo and Larry loved the idea of working together, flying with different airlines also “worked out great,” says Guillermo. For one, there were two different sets of airline benefits to enjoy.And working in the air was everything Guillermo hoped it would be and more.“I was doing my dream job, my childhood dream job,” he says. “I still have to pinch myself that actually, I am a flight attendant.”2018 was also the year Guillermo and Larry got married.Guillermo proposed to Larry on an airplane. The couple were flying back to Dallas after visiting San Francisco, where they’d attended an Adele concert. As they were descending, the Dallas lights glistening out the airplane window, Guillermo suddenly felt the time was right. He turned to Larry and asked him to marry him. Larry smiled, and said yes.“Despite it being impromptu, as an aviation geek, I love that I proposed on a flight,” says Guillermo.The couple started planning their nuptials. Guillermo was excited, but he was unsure what role – if any – his family would play on the wedding day. While Guillermo had mentioned Larry to his parents, they still hadn’t met him. This was partly because Guillermo’s family were in Costa Rica, and partly because Guillermo wasn’t sure how that meeting would play out.“The person that I had the most trouble with was my father – because he was the one that had the hardest time really accepting me,” says Guillermo.As plans for the wedding started to take shape, Guillermo composed a long email to his father.“I said something to the effect of, ‘Hey Dad, I know I really haven’t really talked much about any of my personal life. But I met this person, Larry, who is the love of my life. We are going to get married. Come, don’t come, no problem. But I just need to tell you because this is probably one of the most important days and times of my life.’”Guillermo’s father didn’t attend the wedding. “For those reasons and also because he was towards the end of his life, his mobility was a problem,” Guillermo says.“But my mom, my sisters, my niece and my nephew came, which was far more than I ever imagined or dreamed. That was such a great moment.”Guillermo introduced his mother and sisters to Larry a couple of days before the wedding. They all gathered at a rooftop bar in Dallas, along with Guillermo and Larry’s close friends.When Guillermo’s mother saw Larry for the first time, she enveloped Larry in her arms. The two hit it off right away. Guillermo was overwhelmed with happiness.“For me, to see Larry and mom interact – they just love each other so much,” says Guillermo. “And my sisters just cannot get enough of him – I just sit back, and just enjoy.”Guillermo and Larry’s wedding took place at the Dallas Arboretum, a botanical garden.It was an outdoor wedding, and the couple woke up to the rain pouring and concerned texts from guests worried how the wedding would play out in a downpour.“But then, sure enough, out came the sun at the right time,” recalls Guillermo.Larry and Guillermo wrote their own vows and read them to each other during the ceremony. Guillermo told Larry that he inspired him to be a better son, sibling, friend and person.“You want a partner that is going to challenge you to be better,” says Guillermo. “I always feel that I want to be a better human being just in general, because he is such a figure in my life and everyone’s life – he is the center of everybody’s life.”In turn, Larry promised Guillermo their married life would be “exciting, adventurous and full of passion.”“I’m proud to take you as my husband. I promise to fly with you to the ends of the earth,” Larry said. “I can’t wait to grow old together and look back at this beautiful moment.”He ended the vows telling Guillermo: “Te amo” – Spanish for “I love you.”The reception was held at a local winery. During the celebrations, Guillermo and Larry danced to Rihanna’s hit “We Found Love,” which includes the lyric: “We found love in a hopeless place.”The couple felt it was fitting – the resort they met at did seem a bit of a “hopeless place.” And they never expected that brief meeting would lead to a lasting love.“We made sure that song was played, because we did find love in a hopeless place,” says Larry.“And I love Rihanna, too,” says Guillermo.At one point, Guillermo and Larry walked through the reception doors holding hands, spontaneously lifting their arms in the air, a “victorious” pose, as Guillermo put it.“It was just an electric effect,” he says.A few years into their marriage, Guillermo and Larry visited Costa Rica together for the first time. Larry was excited to see Guillermo’s home country, and Guillermo was excited to show his husband where he grew up – and the visit was also an opportunity for Larry to finally meet Guillermo’s father.Guillermo was nervous about how the meeting would play out, but when he arrived at his parents’ house with Larry in tow, Guillermo’s father opened his arms and hugged Larry tightly.“He said, ‘Welcome home,’” says Guillermo.It was a cathartic, emotional moment for everyone.“I was so nervous that day, meeting the father-in-law,” says Larry. “And when he just said ‘welcome home,’ and hugged me, every bit of nerves went away. I felt comfortable, I felt welcomed, I felt loved.”Larry says the moment felt like the “last piece” of a puzzle slotting into place. Guillermo was overjoyed.“That evening, which we got to spend – me, mom, dad, and Larry – was just a highlight,” says Guillermo.The family played old records on a turntable. Guillermo and his mother danced in the living room, while Larry and Guillermo’s father sipped cocktails and watched, laughing.“I had to just step back, because you have to look at those moments and just kind of create a little mini movie of them,” says Guillermo.Guillermo’s father has since passed away, which makes Guillermo and Larry all the more grateful for that time together in Costa Rica.In general, a feeling of gratitude defines Guillermo and Larry’s relationship – gratitude for each other and what they’ve brought to one another’s lives, and gratitude that their paths crossed over ten years ago.On their anniversary, the couple usually return to Palm Springs to celebrate the day they met.“Not only is Palm Springs beautiful with a great vibe, but we love to go back and celebrate our meeting place,” says Larry. “We weren’t looking, neither one of us – but it did happen, and it’s definitely for life.”“What a gift,” says Guillermo, who says his life today is what he dreamed of “as a little gay boy in Costa Rica, always loving the US, always loving airplanes, always envisioning that I would have a relationship where we are completely free to show our love.”“And we do, we do,” he says. “Who could ask for anything more?”"

        "title": "South Koreans mourn as country’s first celebrity panda, Fu Bao, heads to China",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Ever since her 2020 birth, Fu Bao has been one of South Korea’s biggest celebrities, with fans eagerly following every milestone of her life at Everland Resort’s Panda World, a theme park in Yongin city.But the country’s most famous and beloved giant panda is set to bid South Korea a final farewell in April, with preparations now underway for her journey to her new home in China.During the last week of Fu Bao’s public viewing earlier this month, visitors reportedly endured wait times of 5-6 hours just to catch a glimpse of the celebrity bear for a mere five minutes, as the park restricted viewing times to manage the influx of visitors, according to park officials.On Fu Bao’s last day of public viewing on March 3, she received farewell gifts, including a panda family doll crafted from bamboo, a bouquet of flowers and heart-shaped pieces of bread from her dedicated keepers at Everland.Born to parents Ai Bao and Le Bao in July 2020 as part of China’s “panda diplomacy” program, Fu Bao is South Korea’s first naturally-bred panda.In the days following her birth, Everland’s social media channels offered fans a steady diet of Fu Bao videos, with its YouTube channel pulling in more than 1.2 million subscribers and, as of February, surpassing 500 million cumulative views, according to the park.A two-hour video chronicling Fu Bao’s journey from birth to childhood added to the Everland YouTube channel eight months ago has garnered 1.6 million views.The most recent videos on the channel are now filled with warm and heartfelt messages from viewers, including the beloved cub’s self-proclaimed “online aunties.”“Fu Bao, you’re a happy treasure that came to us like a miracle during the difficult Covid pandemic,” reads one Youtube comment.“Your auntie’s been so happy to have known you and you made me smile so much. You’re a clever one so I’m so sure you’ll do well in a new environment!”Another commented that they “can’t believe how time passes so quickly” and that “we have to let Fu Bao go. I’m so sad to let her go … I support our Fu and love you. Every moment knowing you has been a great joy with laughter. Thank you.”Thanks to Fu Bao’s widespread popularity, her dedicated zookeeper has also found himself in the spotlight, becoming a bit of a social media star himself.Often referred to as her grandpa, Kang Chul-won offered his own farewell message for Fu Bao, noting that the Korean people’s special love for her all began with social media videos shared during the Covid pandemic when the zoo was closed.“She brought help and happiness to a society in many ways that was having a difficult time due to the coronavirus,” Kang said in a video posted to YouTube.During remarks to the press earlier this month, he said people visited the social media sites every day so it felt like he was “raising her together with them.”“Of course there are aspects of her cuteness and playfulness, but they cared so much for her and they shared the same emotions of raising a cub together during such difficult times,” Kang said.Though one could argue it’s impossible to identify a single social media moment that catapulted Fu Bao to stardom, there are a couple of standout videos that have been particularly popular with viewers.In one video, Fu Bao clings tightly to Kang’s leg, unwilling to let go, as he spins gently around the room. After many attempts to uncoil her strong arms, he finally separates himself from her.The other short video shows Fu Bao clinging to Kang’s arm while relaxing on a wooden bench. As the zookeeper gently pushes her arm so he can take his phone out of his pocket, the panda links her arms tightly around his left arm.After he motions to show something on the phone to her, she rolls onto her back.In an announcement from Everland, the company says Fu Bao will be transferred to the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan Province in early April.Everland said that it will keep her in a separate space at Everland Panda World for a month to prepare her to adjust to her new environment before her overseas transfer, which will be carried out in accordance with international regulations.According to the agreement between Samsung C&T, the parent company of Everland, and the China Wildlife Conservation Association, mature pandas must be returned to China before they turn four years old.Once Fu Bao departs for China, there will be four giant pandas left at Everland – Fu Bao’s mother Ai Bao, father Le Bao, and their twin babies Rui Bao and Hui Bao, who were born last July."

        "title": "Miami-Dade County to company that runs Miami Seaquarium: Lease on property ends April 21",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Miami-Dade County told the Dolphin Company, which runs the Miami Seaquarium, in a letter on Thursday that the county is terminating the company’s lease for the property because of violations in how it is maintained.Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said in a news conference that terminating the lease is the best path forward for the safety of the animals, residents and visitors.The Dolphin Company has been told it must vacate by April 21.The Seaquarium is home to roughly 500 animals that include fish, birds, reptiles and marine mammals, Levine Cava said. It is located on the island of Virginia Key in Biscayne Bay.All the animals are owned by the Dolphin Company, and it is up to them what happens to them, she said. The mayor added that the county is working on contingency plans in case any animals are left behind when the company vacates.Eduardo Alberto, CEO of the Dolphin Company, posted on social media platform X during the mayor’s news conference that “we are outside and anything she haas [sic] to say about @MiamiSeaquarium we have the right to hear and be heard. … Waiting outside your office mayor. Dare to speak in front of us.”“The current state of the Miami Seaquarium is unsustainable and unsafe,” Levine Cava said during the news conference. “Meanwhile, our number one priority continues to be the safety and wellbeing of the animals, and moving forward we’ll do everything we can to ensure that they are well cared for.”The Seaquarium has failed to maintain the Flipper Stadium, Manatee Tank Area and Dolphin Stadium, the county said. Other violations include several structures not being maintained property, and dangerous conditions have resulted in injuries to some animals, the county said.There are also decaying animal habitats, lack of veterinary staff and lack of experience by some staff handling the animals, Levine Cava added.In statement sent to CNN late Friday afternoon, Albor contested many of the violations.He said that on March 11, “the tenant will deliver proof to the landlord that none of the defaults or violations occurred, have been cured, or are in the process of being cured during the period specified in the contract.“Consequently, there are no grounds for lease termination, and the tenant will maintain possession and operation of the Miami Seaquarium for the remaining duration of the lease agreement, or until a court ruling dictates otherwise.“We are confident that upon receiving our response with proof of compliance, the landlord will honor the lease agreement,” the statement said.The Seaquarium was home to Lolita, a killer whale that was taken from the ocean in 1970.Last year, Lolita was set to be released back into the ocean after animal welfare activists fought for her release. Lolita died before she could be released.The advocacy group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) celebrated the news in a posted statement on its website on Thursday.“After more than 50 years of miserable animals and false promises to clean up its act, the Seaquarium’s impending shutdown is overdue,” said PETA Vice President Tracy Reiman. “And PETA looks to Miami-Dade County authorities to keep up the good work by ensuring that these animals are sent to reputable facilities where they’ll get the care they so desperately need.”CNN’s Rebekah Riess contributed to this report."

        "title": "A short history of the long fight over breakfast tacos",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos.In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of habañero-hot debate.A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue.But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico.The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate.There’s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN “Searching for Mexico” series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo León.There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Doña Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.“The breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it’s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,” narrates Longoria.CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel – born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years – to find out more.“When I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.”Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as “a really fast food, but not a junkie food.”Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo León are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.Some of the city’s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you’re in meat country.Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey.Compañia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came “to work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.”And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. “I think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.”Along with Doña Mary’s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you’re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony’s Tacos.The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them.“No Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,” says José Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande.“It comes from Mexico – where exactly, it’s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.”As for today, “they’re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila, which all border Texas,” he said.Eddie Vega – who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state – is known as “Taco Poet of Texas.” He points out that historically, what’s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.Before 1836, “the border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.”Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren’t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media.“When you get to south Texas, and I’m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It’s not something we’d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody’s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.”Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them?Austin has “a great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,” Ralat said. “They try some options, and then in their minds, they think it’s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff … and let history speak for itself.”Ralat said San Antonio has “a bit of an inferiority complex that they’re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it’s more diverse, and the food is better.”“To be clear, they’re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they’re also border food. When the Eater article came out” – championing Austin as “home” of the breakfast taco – “San Antonians lost their minds.”Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. “I don’t know that one city – San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo – can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.”Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them.“I think at this point we’ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,” Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. “Is there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.”She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.She also points out the regional differences within Texas.“A flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.”Ralat said he’s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.“I hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. … I want the food to be high quality. I don’t want it to be spin.”Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them – with or without huevos (eggs).“Breakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,” she said.“Bean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn’t have eggs. … Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn’t require eggs. Barbacoa – made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks – is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.”In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter?“Part of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you’ve part of that conversation for a long time.” Vega said.And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.“I think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey … and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.”They’re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. “The place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.”For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning.“I think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture.“It’s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let’s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That’s so nice. And it’s just so joyful.”"

        "title": "18 of the world’s best metro systems",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Crowded, hot, noisy, hectic – subway systems can test the sanity of even the most hardened urbanite, but can you imagine the world’s biggest cities without them? And as millions more of us flock to live in cities every year, efficient mass transit is going to become ever more critical to urban life.Subways – more commonly known as metros outside North America – are as varied as the cities they serve. They encompass everything from claustrophobic Victorian “tube” tunnels cut by hand to elegant turn-of-the-century steel viaducts and hyper-modern subterranean cathedrals served by fully automatic trains.What links them all is their incredible engineering and the role they play in the lives of people and cities. Here are a few of our favorites.The first and still one of the greatest of the world’s metro networks, London’s first subterranean railway line opened in January 1863 – with steam trains running below the streets between Paddington and Farringdon – and the system has since expanded to serve 272 stations on a 250-mile (400-kilometer) network with 11 lines.More than four million Londoners and visitors use the “Tube” every day, but despite the name more of the system lies above ground (55%) than beneath it. Branches extend far out into the surrounding counties of Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire.Far more than a transit system, London Underground is a global cultural icon (copies of its red, white and blue roundels can be found all over the world) and has been a world leader in transport architecture and design for more than a century.Without it, London’s development into one of the world’s great cities would have been impossible.Despite opening more than a century after London’s first Underground line, China’s Beijing Metro has grown rapidly to become one of the world’s longest and busiest systems.Opened in 1971, it now comprises 27 lines - including one Maglev route - extending for 519 miles across the Chinese capital and surrounding districts with 490 stations handling more than 10 million trips per day before the Covid-19 pandemic (3.84 billion trips in 2018).Six of the lines are fully automated with driverless trains. Ridership is recovering strongly and, in common with many other Chinese transit systems, it is struggling to meet the demands of a growing city.Beijing plans to extend its system to more than 620 miles and around 18.5 million trips a day by 2025. In response to chronic traffic congestion, the city is aiming for 60% of trips to be by public transit by 2025 – of those, 62% will involve the metro.Fares start at just $0.40 for a trip of up to four miles, although kids up to 1.3-meters (4 foot 3 inches) tall, over-65s, police and army veterans, military personnel and disabled citizens travel free. Little wonder the trains are so well used!It may not be the oldest, the longest or the busiest, but the Danish capital’s automatic Metro trains run 24 hours a day, seven days a week linking 39 spotlessly clean and stylish stations.Voted the “world’s best metro” on several occasions by international metro rail professionals, it has carried more than a billion passengers since the first section opened in 2002.As you’d expect from a city which prides itself as the home of cool Scandi design, the system exudes a simple, functional but compelling design philosophy and a calming environment quite unlike older and larger Metro systems elsewhere.Today, more than 300,000 people a day use the “M” trains on four lines which connect seamlessly with Copenhagen’s bike hubs, buses and overground trains.Although the trains are short by international standards, they’re incredibly frequent, running every two minutes for most of the day. While there may not be a real driver, kids of all ages can use their imagination to “drive” the trains if they’re lucky enough to bag the front seats!With 308 stations on 16 lines packed mostly within the city limits, the Paris Métropolitain – or Métro for short – has been delivering some of the most iconic cityscapes in the world since 1900.Whether it’s crossing the Seine on the Bir Hakeim Bridge close to the Eiffel Tower or rattling between the rooftops on early 20th century steel structures, the elevated sections of Lines 1, 2, 5 and 6 are the place to head for fleeting glimpses of the city going about its daily life.Like London’s Underground, the Paris Métro is part of the city’s cultural fabric, linking world-famous landmarks, museums and art galleries.Hector Guimard’s iconic art nouveau entrance canopies are known around the world, but the architectural interest doesn’t stop there. Subterranean stations such as the Jules Verne steampunk-esque Arts-et-Metiers on Line 11, Line 4’s stylish Cité or the brutalist tropical garden at Gare de Lyon on Line 14 make an appealing contrast to the standard white-tiled tunnels.Paris is investing billions in new and upgraded automatic Métro lines to improve mobility, but older trains with classic manually-operated doors are still around to surprise and alarm first-time visitors as locals leap out while the wheels are still moving!What comes to mind when you think of Tokyo’s subway? More than likely it’s the white-gloved Oshiya – professional “pushers” employed to cram as many bodies as possible into already-packed metro trains.Efficient, dependable transit is critical in the world’s largest metropolitan area, which is home to more than 35 million people, around 14 million of whom live in the city itself.Tokyo’s city transit network is incredibly dense and complex with no fewer than 100 urban rail lines including, somewhat unusually, two separate subway systems – Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway. Together they have 13 lines and 286 stations serving many of the city’s best-known districts.Despite trains running up to 24 times per hour to precision timetables, many stations are said to operate at well over their intended capacity – some as much as 200% more than they were designed for.All of this can make using Tokyo’s subways an overwhelming experience for visitors, but great efforts have been made in recent years to reduce that stress by providing multi-lingual signage, colour-coding and numbering of stations. Regular travelers can even identify where they are by the unique jingles played over the PA systems at some stations!If losing your phone and Wi-Fi connection on the subway fills you with dread, you might want to head for the capital of South Korea to see what is possible.Befitting the high-tech outlook of this ultra-modern city, Seoul Metro users can continue phone calls and internet browsing uninterrupted while underground or watch TV on screens fitted throughout the trains.As if that wasn’t luxury enough, the climate-controlled trains even have heated seats to make traveling in winter a little more pleasant.Spotlessly clean, efficient, safe, reasonably priced and serving most areas of the city, many experts regard Seoul Metro as the world’s best subway.Since the opening of Line 1 in 1974, it has become a showcase for Korean technology, attracting urban transit planners from all over the world. The nine lines now make up one of the world’s largest metro networks, covering 500 miles (312 kilometers) and 288 stations and carrying almost seven million passengers per day.Another railway inextricably woven into the social, cultural and economic life of the city it serves is New York City’s world-famous Subway. Like the city itself, the NYC Subway never sleeps, operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.At 665 miles (1,070 kilometers) long, with 25 lines – known locally as “trains” - and 472 stations it is North America’s longest and busiest network by some distance and one of the world’s greatest metro operations.It carries more than 3.5 million passengers a day and is unusual in running “local” (making all stops) and “express” trains. It serves all five of the city’s boroughs – Manhattan, Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn, plus an isolated line on Staten Island.Despite its name, much of the NYC Subway runs above ground, often on heavily riveted steel bridges straddling roads, familiar from movies such as “The French Connection” and “Saturday Night Fever.”For even more Subway action, fans should check out the 1974 Walter Matthau movie “The Taking of Pelham 123” (not the 2009 remake), a brilliant fictional account of a subway train hijacking.When the first Subway line opened back in 1904, a ticket cost just five cents. It’s a little more expensive today at $2.90, but trips are still very reasonably priced by international standards and are usually the quickest and most cost-effective way to get around the Big Apple.Mexico City is notorious for its chronic traffic jams and choking pollution, but fortunately citizens and visitors have the option of escaping into an extensive and efficient rapid transit system that enjoys some of the cheapest fares in the world.Opened in 1969, the STC Metro is now the second largest in North America – after New York City – and has 12 lines, 195 stations (115 underground) and more than 140 miles (225 kilometers) of tracks.Instead of conventional steel wheels on steel rails, it employs a similar system to many Paris Métro lines with rubber tyres on steel wheels, offering a smoother and quieter ride on Mexico City’s unstable and earthquake-prone terrain.This decision proved to be a wise one after the system survived a 1985 earthquake intact.In one of the world’s most populous cities, where rich and poor often lead very separate existences, the STC Metro brings together diverse social classes in a shared space to avoid the congestion, noise and pollution in the streets above. And, with a flat fare of just five pesos (around $0.25c) per trip, there’s no cheaper or quicker way to get around this vast metropolis.Many of Asia’s great cities have benefited from lessons learned by the early subway builders in Europe and North America. Instead of tiny tunnels and cramped, stuffy trains, commuters in cities such as Singapore enjoy larger profile trains and spacious stations acting as vibrant community hubs.Despite only opening in 1987, Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) is southeast Asia’s oldest metro network – as well as its busiest. High land values in the densely packed city state also made it the world’s most expensive metro to build, with construction costs reaching $111.5 billion by 2021.Much of the 140-mile (225 kilometer), six-line, fully-automatic network is elevated, although some of the more recent sections are underground, with some stations designed to double as public air-raid shelters.Like the city it serves, MRT is famous for being spotlessly clean and efficient. To keep it that way, smoking, drinking and eating are banned at stations and on trains – and that includes the famously stinky durian fruit, a favourite of many locals!Home to more than 3.7 million people, Germany’s capital enjoys one of the densest urban transit and best integrated networks in the world. The 120 years since the opening of its first U-Bahn (subway) line have also been uniquely turbulent, seeing Berlin at the epicenter of World War II and the Cold War.First opened in 1902, Berlin’s earliest U-Bahn lines are of similar vintage to those in Paris and New York City and share many characteristics. Bright yellow trains rattle above suburban streets on vintage steel viaducts before diving into small-profile tunnels under the city center. Crossing the iconic Oberbaum Bridge on Line U1 – the oldest part of the network – is an unmissable Berlin experience.Today, the U-Bahn network consists of nine lines and 174 stations – 90% of which are underground - carrying more than 1.5 million passengers a day.Complementing the U-Bahn are the classic red and cream S-Bahn trains, providing faster journeys for longer hops across the city.The 16 S-Bahn routes are Berlin’s major arteries, connecting its most important locations with its wider region. Best known is the elevated Stadtbahn, which has provided an unbeatable sightseeing tour through the city’s best-known sights since the mid-1920s, from Zoologischer Garten in the west via the Tiergarten park and Berlin Hauptbahnhof (main station) to Alexanderplatz, home of the Communism-era Television Tower.S-Bahn and U-Bahn trains interchange with local buses and trams at well-organized hubs, providing a superb transit network that reaches every corner of this once-divided city.One of the greatest engineering feats of the Soviet Union was Moscow’s spectacular Metro network. Best known for its extraordinarily grand underground stations, ornately decorated to celebrate workers, peasants and soldiers, the network was designed to serve a dual function – protecting citizens from nuclear strikes as well as keeping them moving.While many newer stations and those away from the city center are less ornate, the best Moscow Metro stations have been, in less turbulent times, tourist attractions in their own right, inspired by Tsarist palaces.A further burst of construction in the 21st century has taken the network to 14 lines radiating from a city centre hub, plus the Koltsevaya (inner circle) and recently-completed 36-mile “Big Circle” line.Carrying more than 8 million Muscovites a day, the Metro is one of the world’s busiest and most extensive, with 269 miles (432 kilometers) of tracks and 258 stations.With just one circular line circumnavigating the city center, Glasgow’s Subway struggles to meet the criteria for a metro “system” but its age and quirky features make it deserving of wider recognition.Opened in 1896, it was the world’s third underground railway – after London and Budapest – and a statement of the Scottish city’s industrial and economic power. Two tiny tunnels running clockwise and counter-clockwise for just over six miles link the city center with communities south and north of the River Clyde that were once world-famous for shipbuilding and heavy engineering.Originally powered by cables, the unique 4-foot-gauge trains were converted to electric power in 1935 and closed for a complete rebuild to modern standards in 1977-79.The brightly coloured new trains earned the railway its “Clockwork Orange” nickname, although they are now painted white. New Swiss-built trains are now being introduced and the railway is about to move into its fourth era, which will see it move to fully automatic operation.If Beijing is China’s political center, then Shanghai is its vibrant creative, commercial and financial heart – and the biggest city in the world’s second-most populous country. Efficient mass transit has been critical to its incredible growth over the last 30 years.Opened in 1993, Shanghai Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) is expanding at a breakneck pace to become the world’s longest and busiest subway network. It currently has 19 lines serving 14 of the megacity’s 16 districts and a metropolitan area of almost 40 million people.Vying with Beijing for the title of the world’s longest and busiest metro network, Shanghai currently exceeds 500 miles, but further expansion should take it to 620 miles (about 1,000 kilometers) and 25 lines by 2025. By then, nowhere in central Shanghai will be more than 2,000 feet (600 meters) from a subway station.With 408 stations, it currently carries more than 10 million passengers per day but its one-day record is an incredible 13.3 million trips, set on March 8, 2019.In common with other subway systems built by the Soviet Union, the Kyiv Metro serves a dual purpose – a feature that continues to be essential as the city suffers regular Russian missile attacks. Spacious stations feature specialized ventilation and filtration equipment and huge metal blast doors that can be sealed above and below ground.Plans for an underground railway go back as far as 1884, but the first of Kyiv’s three metro lines did not open until November 1960 – the third Soviet city to gain a metro after Moscow and St Petersburg.Expansion continued after Ukraine’s independence in 1991, creating a three-line, 42-mile network which serves all 10 city districts.Since February 2022, Kyiv Metro’s civil protection function has come to the fore, with 47 of the 52 stations designated as public bomb shelters. At 346 feet below ground, Arsenalna station in the city center was famously the deepest in the world – taking five minutes to reach by escalator - until it was surpassed by a station on the Chongqing network in China.In the early days of the Russian invasion in March 2022 up to 40,000 residents reportedly sought refuge in metro stations and President Volodymyr Zelensky used metro stations to host international news conferences. Despite this, the network continues to operate, providing fast and frequent services around a city fighting to maintain an air of normality under the shadow of war.With cameos in numerous movies and TV shows including “The Blues Brothers,” “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and “ER” - Chicago’s “L” (short for “elevated”) rapid transit system is a world-famous symbol of the Windy City.Like many of the economic and industrial powerhouses of the late-19th and early 20th century – including New York, Paris, Hamburg and Liverpool – Chicago chose to run its new electric trains on steel viaducts elevated high above congested city streets. These quickly became one of the city’s defining features and a catalyst for economic growth in the dense downtown district.In 2005, Chicago Tribune readers voted the “L” as one of the seven wonders of Chicago.Although the “L is primarily associated with its city center “Loop”, opened in 1897 and featuring exceptionally tight curves between buildings, the network now extends to eight colour-coded lines, 145 stations and 103 miles (166 kilometers) of route, sections of which are at ground level, in tunnels or cuttings.Along with the New York City Subway and Copenhagen Metro, it is one of just three systems in the world running trains 24 hours a day. More than 100 million trips were made on the “L” in 2022 – around 320,000 per day - making it the second busiest transit system in the United States.Another relative newcomer to the mass transit scene, Indian capital New Delhi opened its first line in 2002. It was the second city in India after Kolkata to gain a metro but has since expanded rapidly to become the country’s largest and busiest network with more than two billion trips recorded in 2023.First mooted in the 1960s, the construction of a modern mass transit system became vital as Delhi’s population doubled between 1981 and 1998, creating intolerable congestion and air pollution.Now boasting 12 high-capacity lines with 288 stations across 250 miles (400 kilometers) of route, Delhi Metro is India’s biggest and busiest mass transit network. By mileage it is the world’s 12th longest system and the 16th busiest for ridership.Serving Delhi and the nearby cities of Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noiza and Ghadiabad, the Metro’s fast, modern and spacious trains have reportedly helped to reduce private car use and traffic accidents and drastically cut pollution.India’s Central Road Research Institute estimates that using the metro saves commuters an estimated 66 minutes per day compared to driving!Transit planners flock to Hong Kong from across the globe to discover how its Mass Transit Railway (MTR) delivers world-class service and reliability to the territory’s 7.4 million citizens.Densely populated city areas crowded around a deep natural harbour and towns scattered across dozens of islands and mountainous countryside, Hong Kong is not an easy place to build railways, but since 1975 MTR has established an enviable reputation for quality, efficiency and punctuality.It regularly achieves a 99.9% “on-time” rate – a figure most other railways across the world can only dream of. MTR’s funding model also draws widespread admiration; construction of new lines has opened up new areas of the region for development, helping to fund the expansion of the system. The model was inspired by Tokyo, but has its origins in London’s Metropolitan Railway, which created the iconic ‘Metro-Land’ outer suburbs from the early-20th century.Ten high-capacity lines link Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories, including the dedicated high-speed Airport Express link to Lantau Island and the Disneyland Resort Line.Despite the compact geography of the territory, MTR operates more than 150 miles of route and 99 stations, the latter being famously clean and spacious.MTR’s success at home has encouraged it to expand far beyond Hong Kong, managing projects and operations in mainland China, Sweden, Australia and the UK, where it holds the operating concession for London’s Elizabeth Line.Hungarian engineers were among the earliest pioneers of electric-powered technology in the late-19th century, not least in the field of railways.Although London opened the first underground railway (see above), it initially employed conventional steam trains. It fell to Budapest to build the world’s first electrified underground subway system.Line M1 was completed in 1896 and was a radical leap forward for urban mass transit, introducing electric lighting in stations and train cars, bi-directional cars and the first use of an overhead wire system - rather than a ground level contact rail - to supply electricity to the trains.Known as the “Small Underground,” M1 runs under Andrássy Avenue on the Pest side of the city from Andrássy Square to Városliget (City Park).Designed to carry city dwellers to the park without spoiling the elegant streetscape with tramcars and power lines, the line has seen many changes over the last 120 years but its tiny trains still carry around 80,000 riders a day as part of a wider four-line network expanded between 1970 and 2014."

        "text": "What makes a street “cool?” Is it a plethora of restaurants, bars, cafes you can spend hours dipping in and out of? Is it independent stores, selling wares you won’t find anywhere else? Or is it just a general vibe, a friendly warmth that’s hard to pin down, but which you know when you feel it?Time Out reckons it’s all of the above – the global media company’s put together its list of the “coolest streets in the world right now”, factoring in each street’s food offerings, drink options, cultural delights, nightlife and overall sense of community.To produce the 2024 lineup, the global listings guide’s network of editors and writers chipped in to make the case for their favorite streets in their respective cities.Claiming the top spot is buzzy High Street in Melbourne, with local Time Out Melbourne editor Leah Glynn praising the road’s “epic restaurants, hidden bars, live music venues and boutique shops” and what Glynn called a “warm sense of community spirit that means everyone feels welcome.”It’s not the first time a Melbourne-based street’s graced Time Out’s list, with Gertrude Street and Smith Street featuring in past iterations of Time Out’s rankings. Melbourne’s omnipresence led Glynn to suggest “Melburnians are spoiled for choice when it comes to well-trodden thoroughfares that deliver on food, culture and fun.”Melbourne’s High Street is located in the coastal Australian city and criss-crosses the suburbs of Northcote, Thornbury and Preston.Time Out praises the street’s “unique, something-for-everyone local businesses” from Casa Nata, which sells delicious Portuguese custard tarts to 1800 Lasagne – a restaurant born out of the pandemic that’s now a thriving pasta spot with outdoor seating.High Street’s also great for bar hopping, suggests Time Out, highlighting “intimate and exclusive” rooftop bar Gigi Rooftop and buzzing dance spot Francesca’s Bar.Marco Finanzio, the founder and managing director of Gigi Rooftop, told CNN Travel he first opened a spot on High Street 14 years ago, and back then was “dreaming of the area becoming an iconic destination.”Finanzio said he and his team “dearly love our street and community.”“This acknowledgment is a wonderful achievement for so many local businesses who have worked tirelessly to serve locals, navigate a pandemic and battle rising costs to create a vibrant street that has come out on top of the world,” he added.Ben Mathieson, of Francesca’s Bar, said it’s really “special that everyone now knows how cool our street is.”“My neighbors are all independent locally owned businesses, you won’t find any big corporate brands, a great mix of hospo, live music, retail, health and wellness and all the traders have each other backs,” Matheison told CNN Travel.Mathieson also shouted out the Melburnians who “make the street cool as much as we do.”“We don’t exist without the awesome locals,” he said.Coming in at number two on Time Out’s 2024 list is Hollywood Road in Hong Kong, home to incredible restaurants including Michelin-starred Tate Dining Room, as well as cultural site Man Mo Temple and the Mid-Levels Escalators, the world’s longest outdoor covered escalator system.Meanwhile, the number three spot is claimed by East Eleventh in Austin, Texas – lauded by Time Out for packing a lot into a short quarter-mile. On East Eleventh, Vintage Bookstore & Wine Bar gets a shout out as the ideal spot to grab a drink and dive into a new read, while Kenny Dorham’s Backyard is the perfect place to see live music in “a makeshift venue that feels like a permanent house party,” according to Time Out.Time Out also notes how some of the world’s busiest streets have changed for the better in recent years – with many becoming “more walkable and pleasant places to spend our time.”“Outdoor drinking and dining, at one point a temporary measure, has become a staple on many of the streets on our hotlist,” said Time Out, adding this walkability has been “bolstered by green initiatives like pedestrianization and low-traffic avenues.” Consell de Cent in Barcelona, Spain, which is number 10 on Time Out’s list, banned cars in 2023.For each street on its list, Time Out has recommended a range of fun things to do – from yoga at Ardha Bikram Yoga on Guatemala Street in Buenos Aires (number four) and drinking natural wines at hole-in-the-wall bar Small Shifting Space on Jalan Petaling in Kuala Lumpur (number six) to enjoying cream soda floats at Guuutara Coffee on Chazawa-dori in Tokyo (number nine).Time Out says the goal of the list is to celebrate “the avenues, thoroughfares, backstreets and boulevards where local life really thrives.”The full top 30 can be seen at Time Out’s website.1.

        "title": "Tourists have returned to North Korea for the first time since the pandemic. Here’s what they saw",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Lena Bychcova couldn’t really believe it when her North Korean tourist visa came through.Many Russian tourists have found themselves locked out of tourism destinations. But North Korea — as a key Russian ally — offered a rare opportunity to travel.The marketing professional was one of about 100 Russian nationals who were allowed to travel to North Korea this month in what is believed to be the hermit kingdom’s first international tourist trip since the coronavirus pandemic.Tourism in North Korea is tightly controlled. Individual travelers are not permitted into the country, and groups are accompanied by minders. Tourism revenue is used to support the regime of dictator Kim Jong Un.Traveling to the “hermit kingdom” is not without significant risks. American college student Otto Warmbier was detained on a North Korea trip in 2016, allegedly for stealing a propaganda poster. He was returned to the United States 17 months later in a vegetative state and died soon after.Bychcova and the rest of the group arrived in Pyongyang on February 9, traveling via a North Korean-owned Air Koryo plane from Vladivostok.While Bychcova admits she was anxious about the trip, she says that curiosity won out and she couldn’t pass up the chance to see a country that few tourists have the opportunity to explore.Travel blogger Ilya Voskresensky, who also joined the tour, felt similarly tense – he listed his part-time job, selling vintage dishes, as his profession rather than revealing he was a content creator. Despite his misgivings, he admits that one reason to go through with the trip was to discover whether modern-day North Korea would compare to the Soviet Russia his family members told him about.“When you look at North Korea you realize that your grandma and grandpa were living like they do here,” Voskresensky tells CNN. “It’s a teleport into the past. There are absolutely no advertisements in the city. The only thing on display are party slogans, flags and so on.”The four-day trip cost each visitor about $750. The group had Russian-speaking guides and translators with them at all times. The itinerary included a visit to the bronze statues of the late leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on Mansu Hill, the Mangyongdae Children’s Palace, where kids put on a music and dance performance, and three days at Masikryong Ski Resort.The Russians were also given strict rules to follow, especially when it came to taking pictures and videos.“We were asked not to photograph the military or people in uniform in general, not to photograph the construction sites or any of the buildings under construction,” Bychcova explains. “And there were rules about how to take photographs and generally treat portraits or sculptures of leaders. If you have a newspaper or magazine with a picture of the leader, then you cannot fold the newspaper so that the portrait becomes wrinkled.”These newspapers became some of her favorite souvenirs from North Korea. Bychcova says that there wasn’t much to buy, but there were two shops – one in the airport and one in the capital – where she and other tourists could get magnets, dolls, Lego sets and other small gifts.Before the pandemic, the largest source of inbound tourists to North Korea wasn’t Russia – it was China.The Russian ski trippers were the first tourists allowed into the hermit kingdom since the pandemic, a sign of Russia’s increasing popularity in North Korea.With global sanctions and a shrinking pool of allies, Russia and North Korea’s increased interest in one another has raised the alarm among US Intelligence officials.North Korea has supplied Russia with missiles to use against Ukraine.In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin presented a car to his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un. The act was a possible violation of United Nations sanctions imposed against the country for its nuclear weapons program.Both Voskresensky and Bychcova say that their decision to travel wasn’t about politics – they went to North Korea eager to get to know local people and form relationships.After returning, though, Bychcova doesn’t believe such a thing is truly possible in the North Korean system.“About 200 kids – we counted them on stage! – had prepared an hour-long concert especially for us. And there were just 97 of us,” she says.“So there were more people on stage than spectators. We could feel they were trying to create a certain image of what North Korea looks like for us. But some details revealed that it was not entirely true, that there is another life.”While the Russians were able to discuss their trip to North Korea and their thoughts on the Kim regime freely, that same privilege does not apply in their own country.Criticism of Putin, Russia’s policies and the military are criminal offenses in Russia.A prominent ex-KGB official turned pro-military blogger who had been vocal in supporting the war in Ukraine was arrested and charged with “extremist activity” last summer for comments critical of Putin.Just last week, a 33-year-old dual citizen of Russia and the United States was arrested in Yekaterinburg and accused of “providing financial assistance to a foreign state in activities directed against Russia security.” The reason? She reportedly donated $51 to a Ukrainian charity.While both Voskresensky and Bychcova were aware of North Korea’s human rights abuses, they both tell CNN they hoped the trip would be worth it in order to connect with regular North Korean civilians.Now, both say they would consider going to North Korea again someday – but only if the political situation changes.“The main message of my content is that anywhere: no matter what country, no matter what nationality, it is regular people who live there, and you should treat people with love everywhere,” says Voskresensky. “I hope traveling will save the world.”Another Russian ski trip in North Korea is slated for March 2024."

        "title": "How to survive a cobra bite – or better yet, avoid one entirely",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Thailand is full of snakes – more than 200 species, including cobras. That might be unsettling for some people, but it was ideal for Prangmart Charoenwai as a boy in southern Thailand.He was intrigued by the reptiles. He once captured a nonvenomous sunbeam snake, letting it go days later when he couldn’t feed it properly. He watched online videos to learn techniques in grabbing them, he told CNN.He saw his first cobra when he was about 15 or 16.“It was quite big,” Prangmart, now 39, said. “I later saw that snake spread its hood. I stood there watching its behavior. It threatened me, but I felt it was not scary. … I thought it was beautiful.”His fascination and confidence grew, but his good fortune with cobras didn’t last.In April 2021, the market owner went out on a mission in Trang province in southern Thailand with his rescue group, which responds to routine emergency response tasks, including snake-catching.Residents in the area said they were concerned about some king cobras. Prangmart arrived at the site with about 15 team members.They didn’t find any cobras the first day, but that changed the next day after some thick brush and overgrown vines were cleared out.“I saw a hole in a big rock where I spotted a snake’s tail, and it looked like it was going into that hole,” Prangmart recalled. “I ran there quickly, and then used a hook to try to get it out.”But the snake eluded the device.“Due to my carelessness, because I have been working in this area for too long, I decided to use my bare hand to snatch the cobra’s tail out.”That impulsive grab turned out to be a major miscalculation.Cobras have an extensive range – from much of Africa into the Middle East, then into India and the rest of South Asia. From there, they continue into Southeast Asia and Indonesia. That puts them in potential contact with billions of people.They belong to the elapid family of snakes, which has roughly 300 venomous species. Coral snakes, sea snakes, mambas and kraits are also in this group.There are about 30 cobra species, according to expert Rom Whitaker, who helped start the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust in India. (Its spinoff, the Irula Snake-catchers Industrial Cooperative Society, supplies the venom used to produce life-saving antivenom to India).Whitaker said he uses an approximation of the number of species because cobra taxonomy often changes as experts learn more about the snakes. Africa accounts for roughly two-thirds of the species.Generally, cobras deliver a neurotoxin, which interferes with nerve impulses and can cause paralysis of the heart and lungs. That’s different from that of many vipers, such as rattlesnakes. They generally have a hemotoxin that attacks the blood vessels and causes bleeding and tissue damage.But Nick Brandehoff, who practices emergency medicine and medical toxicology in Colorado and California, said he and other experts are learning that snake venom is more complicated than that simple breakdown. Some elapids have hemotoxic properties, and some vipers have neurotoxic properties. It can vary from snake to snake.Either way, venomous snakebites are a serious problem in many tropical regions. Only an average of five people die a year of venomous snakebites in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But the World Health Organization estimates around 81,000 to 138,000 people die each year worldwide from snakebites, while about three times that many people live with permanent disabilities.Despite the high number of deaths and envenomings (bites in which venom is delivered into the body), don’t assume cobras are aggressive.“Cobras are shy snakes, and though they make a dramatic show when cornered and alarmed, rearing up, spreading a hood, and hissing loudly, this is stark fear, not aggression,” said Whitaker. “The snake only wants to be left alone.”Brandehoff, who helps run the Asclepius Snakebite Foundation, added that “they’re typical of most other snakes in that they don’t want human contact.” And he emphasized cobras don’t chase people.Kim Gray, curator of herpetology and ichthyology with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, cited another reason cobras don’t like to bite people.“Venom is valuable to the snake, and it is used to immobilize prey and begin the digestion process, which the snake needs because it eats whole food items and has no limbs to help it in this process,” Gray said.“So it does not want to waste its venom by recklessly biting and envenoming all the humans it can encounter.”Biting is a last resort if its typical warning signs to back off don’t work, she said.The vast majority of cobra bites happen to agricultural workers in fields and other locals, often low-income people living in easy-to-enter dwellings and who sleep on the floor, Brandehoff said.“Though people have an idea that the ‘jungle is full of snakes,’ that’s really not true,” Whitaker added. “Cobras are most common in agricultural areas thanks to the proliferation of their favorite prey: rats and mice.“Alert snakes like cobras are frightened of humans and usually flee or freeze when a human approaches. The odds of encountering a cobra on the usual tourist routes in India or Thailand are very slim.”People staying in hotels with full facilities in a city have less to worry about than those in rural, rustic facilities, Gray said.If you do find yourself bedding down in a place more likely to attract cobras, she suggested:• Keep debris away from the shelter• Clean up food and grains that might attract rats• Try to keep furniture higher up off the floor and sleep in an elevated bed.Whitaker said it is essential to shine a flashlight when walking at night and not put your hands in thick, bushy spots.The experts are unanimous: Leave the snake alone.“Move deliberately and calmly away from the snake – while keeping an eye on its location if possible,” Gray said. “Move to an open area free of brush and rock outcrops if possible” if you’re outdoors.“Do not try to restrain it, capture it or kill it with a broom or shovel or anything,” she emphasized.Brandehoff concurred. “Give it its space. You are a large mammalian predator to them. They do not want to engage you.”Whitaker said that bites “usually don’t happen from the strike of a cobra in the hooded posture but … happen when the snake is stressed by being stepped upon or mistakenly grabbed.”What should you do if you chance on a cobra that’s already really close and seems ready to strike?“Move quickly away,” Gray said. “Human reaction time is so slow compared to their strike so there may not be much you can do – but typically the trajectory of the cobra’s bite is forward and downward, and they are not able to change direction mid-strike, so perhaps a sideways rapid move away from the snake may be beneficial.”Prangmart Charoenwai’s impulsive maneuver to grab an escaping cobra cost him.“The hole was not deep; the snake made a U-turn out quicker than I thought.”That’s when it happened. Prangmart got bit on his left thumb. Then he got bit on his right hand.Despite the strikes, Prangmart was determined to capture and bag the cobra himself since he was already bitten – even though his left hand was already getting numb.“I was told to step aside; I refused. Instead, they told me to stay chilled and urged me to quickly go to the hospital and treat my wound.”They finally bagged the cobra, and Prangmart was able to walk to an ambulance. But his trouble had just started – the hospital was two hours away.As Prangmart was learning the hard way, cobra bites are very serious business. But they are by no means a death sentence.“Most snakebites, even cobra bites, are not fatal.” Whitaker said. “But any snakebite must be treated as a medical emergency.“The single most important thing to do is to get to a hospital without any delay. Do not resort to any local or home remedy because there is only one cure for a snakebite and that is antivenom.”Gray said that you should try to stay calm and “immobilize the limb that was bitten, get to the closest hospital without delay (and) make a note of where the bite occurred and the time the bite occurred.”Also, get a description or photo of the snake if it can be taken safely. This can help doctors with treatment, she said.Do not tie a tourniquet or try the old “cut and suction” method, Whitaker said, nor should you use a so-called “snakebite kit.”Brandehoff said that if the bite comes from a cobra with strictly neurotoxic venom, people may recommend a crepe wrap, which can help reduce the spread of the venom from a limb to the rest of the body via compression.“The problem with that is most people don’t know what kind of snake bit them” and that it’s not reasonable to expect people to readily ID various cobra species.And if the venom has hemotoxic properties, a wrap can cause more harm than good, damaging tissue around the bite area, he said.Rings and other jewelry should be removed.“The earlier antivenom can be administered, the better your chances of not having long-term disability or potentially dying,” he said.Spitting cobras can cause “venom ophthalmoplegia,” which is basically burning of the eyes, Brandehoff said. Permanent damage can occur but is rarer.The main treatment is washing the eyes “copiously,” he said.Prangmart’s arrival at the hospital in Thailand did not end his emergency. “After I received the serum, I had an allergic reaction,” he said.“I started to have short breaths, rashes. The doctor had to rush back and treated me again. I was watched regularly during that time.”Was he afraid he would die?“The severe conditions I had to endure at the hospital lasted about two hours. It was when I thought I may not make it. My heart rate was racing, too.”Prangmart pulled through the immediate crisis but then embarked on a 15-day ordeal, bouncing between Western medical doctors and practitioners of Thai traditional medicine to try to save his left hand, where repeated infections threatened to spread.He eventually got better, but he’s left with a big scar, an important reminder for him and the rest of his team.“At that time when I saw the snake, I felt excited and I didn’t want it to escape into the hole. Because of that excitement, I hurriedly grabbed the snake. What happened to me, it was my own carelessness.”And if someone else should encounter a cobra?“Keep calm and watch it; don’t hurry, turn your back and run. … If you are very scared, start to retreat backward step by step,” he said. “Generally, these snakes are not likely to attack people first unless there is clear threat to them.”Cobras keep the environment in balance.“Without cobras, the rodent problem in agricultural areas could lead to famine,” Whitaker said. “These are the most efficient rodent predators in existence, able to enter rat burrows and clean out the entire family.”But he said antivenom efforts must continue.“Those of us who appreciate and respect snakes need to support programs to help reduce the tremendous burden of snakebites affecting tens of millions of rural people in Africa, Asia and South America,” Whitaker said.Brandehoff agreed: “We can’t attempt to eradicate snakebites like we can malaria. The best thing we can do is try to mitigate snakebites by trying to minimize contacts.”We need to “learn to live with them. … In a lot of cultures, there’s a lot of fear of snakes. See a snake, kill a snake; it’s not helpful.”"

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Christian Friese was standing in the arrivals area in Honolulu Airport, Hawaii, peering at a large airport map.“You are here,” read the sign above the map.Christian was assessing the airport layout, working out where she needed to go next, when, out of the corner of her eye, she spotted a man wearing a Hawaiian Airlines uniform, walking her way.Then, the man was at her side – tall, friendly and smiling.“Excuse me,” asked the stranger, “Do you need any assistance?”Christian turned to look at him properly and was momentarily taken aback.“He was perfection,” Christian tells CNN Travel today. “He smiled with his whole face. I couldn’t believe he was talking to me.”It was summer 2015, and Christian was on a solo vacation to Hawaii. She didn’t usually travel alone, preferring to have a gaggle of girlfriends close by – but this trip was an exception. The previous year, Christian’s mother had passed away suddenly, and Christian had spent several months trying to process this loss.“It was because my mom had passed that I thought, ‘I just need a break,’’ says Christian.So she’d packed her suitcase, left her home in Portland, Oregon and flown more than five hours to Honolulu. From there, Christian was set to travel to the island of Kauai – known for its beautiful cliffs, sprawling rainforest and stunning mountain ranges.But first, Christian needed to figure out how to get to the gate for her connecting flight.She explained this last part to the tall, smiling man now standing at her side, offering assistance.“He asked me what I was looking for, I told him, and then he said he could walk me to my gate,” recalls Christian.Christian obliged, and as they set off together towards the gate, the airport stranger introduced himself as Aaron.A Hawaiian Airlines flight attendant from the Big Island, Aaron Malulo had actually worked Christian’s flight from Portland, but neither of them had spotted each other on board.Instead, Aaron first noticed Christian when she was standing by the airport map, looking a little lost.“I thought that she was cute,” Aaron tells CNN Travel today. “And I thought that I could probably help her – because I’m at that airport every single day, so my chances of being able to offer assistance were really high.”Christian’s gate turned out to be pretty far away, and it took 10 minutes or so to walk over there. But Christian and Aaron barely noticed the distance, or the time passing – they were absorbed in conversation the whole way.“We had a really easy, natural conversation,” says Aaron.As they walked, both pulling wheelie suitcases behind them, Christian explained she’d lived in Hawaii as a kid – her dad had been stationed there in the US military. Aaron, who was from the Big Island, but knew Kauai pretty well, gave Christian his tips on the best things to see and do there.“We just chatted as we walked to the gate,” Christian recalls. “And then when we got there, we shook hands. And we only got each other’s first names. So he just said, ‘Have a good birthday. Nice to meet you.’”Christian thought that was sweet – she’d mentioned, in passing, that it was her birthday the following day.“Have a nice life,” she replied, only half-joking.As Aaron walked away, the thought briefly crossed his mind that perhaps he should have asked Christian for her contact details – but he quickly dismissed it.“I just walked away appreciating the moment, instead of second guessing myself about whether I should have done more,” he says.And as Christian headed to her connecting flight, the same thought crossed her mind.“I think I was wrapped up in our conversation and was having such a nice time, I didn’t think to even get a last name,” says Christian. “And I didn’t look to see if he was married either.”Christian didn’t think she’d ever see Aaron again – he said he wasn’t scheduled to work her flight back the following week, so it wasn’t obvious how their paths would ever cross again.But after briefly toying with regret, Christian refocused on her next flight and the vacation ahead.She decided to view the interaction as a good sign of what was to come – an unexpected moment of levity, excitement and kindness kicking off her trip, beginning a new chapter.Christian spent the next several days enjoying Kauai. As she relaxed on sandy beaches, swam, hiked and ate well, she reflected on her mother, on their close relationship, on her childhood in Hawaii.“I spread her ashes too, while I was there,” says Christian. “And so it was cathartic for me, a nice little retreat for myself.”Every so often, Christian thought about the airport stranger – she remained grateful for his friendliness and she followed all his Kauai tips.Then, it was time for Christian to head home. She took an early morning flight from Kauai to Oahu. At Honolulu Airport, she just had time to grab a breakfast sandwich before heading to catch her connecting flight home to Portland.As she walked down the jet bridge to board her flight, brushing crumbs off her clothing, Christian spotted him right away: Aaron, standing at the end of the walkway, right in front of the airplane, greeting the boarding passengers.Christian couldn’t believe it. First, she was surprised, Then she was flooded with happiness. And then she regretted the breakfast sandwich, and her casual airplane attire.“I just remember thinking, ‘If I’d known he’d be there, I would have looked cuter, I would have brushed my teeth,’” says Christian, laughing. “I wasn’t expecting it.”As Christian approached the plane, Aaron spotted her. He smiled – the smile that had won Christian over on their first meeting, the smile that lit up his whole face.It was true, Aaron wasn’t supposed to be working that day. But then the night before, his work system had flashed up that a flight attendant was needed on that day’s flight from Honolulu to Portland. Someone had dropped out, and someone else needed to pick up the shift.When Aaron saw the notification, he immediately thought of Christian.“I remembered that was the day she’d said she was flying back,” recalls Aaron. “And I thought ‘You know, we had such a nice conversation the first time. I want to see her again.’ And so I picked up that trip, that shift – and that’s how I got myself on her flight.”As Christian made her way down the jet bridge, she wondered what she should say to Aaron when it was her turn to board the flight. In the end, she just said hello, and he said the same back – but it was obvious they were both happy to see one another.Then, over the duration of the five and a half hour flight, Aaron kept coming over to say hello again, to check in on how Christian was doing, to chat a little about her time in Kauai.Meanwhile Christian, who’d planned to sleep through the flight, didn’t close her eyes once.“I just kept watching him, walking around the cabin,” Christian recalls. It was obvious Aaron was popular with his colleagues. Some passengers who were regular on the route knew him on a first name basis. Christian was charmed by this. She already liked him, now she liked him even more.“And all the while, I was wondering if it was intentional or not, that he’d ended up on my flight, because he didn’t say. And so the whole time I thought, ‘What is happening?’” she says.Aaron wanted to talk to Christian, to chat properly during the flight. But it wasn’t really the right place. He was working, for one, plus “it’s awkward to stand and have one person be seated and to carry on a significant conversation,” he says.He realized all the plane journey could be was “a place to touch base and just make sure she’s doing okay.”As the flight prepared to land in Portland, Christian decided to be assertive – whether Aaron was on the flight thanks to his own doings, or thanks to fate, she didn’t want another meeting between them to go by without them swapping contact details.So she dug out a business card from her bag. On the front were her contact details, including details on her realtor job back home in Portland. On the back, Christian scribbled a message:“Thank you for taking good care of me,” she wrote. “It was so nice to see you again.”As Christian got off the plane, she said goodbye to Aaron, met his eye, and then slipped him the card.For Aaron, this was a “great sign.”“I didn’t have a plan,” he says, “And so I’m glad that she took the initiative to keep the ball going by giving me her contact information.”Later, when he got off work, Aaron sent Christian a message:“I was hoping you’d be on my flight again,” he wrote.From there, Aaron and Christian texted a little bit back and forth, but then the conversation reached a bit of a stalemate. Aaron was busy flying. Christian’s out-of-office was no longer on and she was back to her day job, busy selling Oregon real estate.Then, one evening, Aaron looked Christian up online – her business website was listed on the card she’d given him.“And in her little bio on the website, she mentioned that she had gone to Oregon State University,” recalls Aaron. “I also went to Oregon State – at a different time. So I decided to send her a message and say that we had that in common.”As it happened, Aaron’s message came through while Christian was at an Oregon State pep rally. She stared at the message in disbelief – the fact she and the stranger she’d met at the airport in Hawaii were both Oregon State alumni seemed like a huge coincidence. She texted back right away.“I’m literally at an Oregon State pep rally right now,” replied Christian. “And I have tickets to the Beavers playing Michigan next week.”The Beavers – Oregon State’s football team – were playing the University of Michigan at Michigan’s homeground. Christian had been planning to go along with an old college friend, but the friend canceled at the last minute. At first, Christian had been disappointed – but now it felt serendipitous: Christian asked Aaron if he wanted to go to the game with her instead.“Had she not backed out, I never would have invited him,” says Christian today. “But I had the game tickets. And I had the hotel lined up. And so I said, ‘Oh, you’re a Beaver? I’m going to this game. Do you want to meet me there?’ And he says ‘Yes.’”A week later, Christian and Aaron made their way to in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Aaron flew all night to make it there from Hawaii. On the journey over, he felt “nervous.”“But I was game for a new opportunity and just trying to see what would happen next, and keeping it alive,” says Aaron. “I thought watching a football game would be fun, and a great way to see her again.”“I felt nervous too,” says Christian. Their text interactions had been fun, but brief. They hadn’t spoken on the phone or via video call. On her flight over, Christian considered that she still didn’t really know much about Aaron, beyond what she’d learned in their 10 minute airport conversation.“He had no social media presence – I couldn’t look him up or anything, as he doesn’t use it,” she says. “But we both just went into it looking forward to it from the last time we saw each other – which was about three weeks before at the airport. It was exciting.”And as soon as they reunited, Christian and Aaron’s nerves faded away. The easy connection they’d felt at the airport returned, effortlessly.The game “was a dud,” as Aaron puts it – Oregon State lost. But the uninteresting game gave Aaron and Christian plenty of time to connect.“We talked a lot about our lives,” says Aaron.“We lost the game,” says Christian. “But we won at love.”Over the rest of the weekend in Ann Arbor, Christian and Aaron wandered around, chatting.“We didn’t have a rental car and so we walked everywhere in the little town – to get food, to go to the game. And so we always had time to talk,” says Aaron.“I remember thinking he was fun to travel with,” recalls Christian. “And we were both in similar situations – no kids, hadn’t been married before. So we just talked about life, and Oregon State, until it was really late. He’s easy to be around. I really love college football, and he does too. And I’d always wanted someone to share that with me.”All too quickly Sunday came around and Christian and Aaron traveled to the airport together to board separate flights – Aaron back to Hawaii, and Christian back to Oregon.“We parted ways at the airport,” recalls Aaron. “I got on the train in the airport – one of the little terminal trains. And that was it – that was the end of our fun weekend.”As they said goodbye, Christian teared up.“He was getting on the train in one direction, I was getting on the other train and so we just parted – kind of dramatically,” she says. “I remember crying and thinking, ‘Why am I crying?’ But it just was a really, really nice weekend.”Christian calls the few days with Aaron in Michigan, “light and perfect.” She wanted to hold onto the feeling she had when she was with him, but she wasn’t sure what the future held.“I thought maybe this is just our little season – that one, really fun weekend.”But while they didn’t make any promises to meet again, once they were back in their respective homes, Christian and Aaron “just naturally kept in touch.”Before long, Aaron was visiting Christian in Portland. And soon, he was staying with her whenever he had layovers in the city.That fall, Aaron and Christian went to several more Oregon State football games, meeting in Arizona, California and Washington.The fact Aaron flew around the US as part of his job – plus the fact Christian’s realtor role offered work flexibility – made meeting up relatively straightforward. Aaron and Christian were able to gradually get to know each other over a series of visits.“I don’t really feel like we talked specifically about how this would work. I think we just started to make it work for us,” says Aaron. “And what I remember that being like was just us spending more and more time together.”“We didn’t have a label on the relationship,” says Christian. “But I told everyone about him, showed them pictures of us, and they were just so happy for me.”For the next two years, Christian and Aaron “just had a lot of fun, traveling back and forth together,” as Christian recalls.Then, in 2017, the two bought a house in Portland together. They decided Aaron would base himself with Christian in Portland, and he could still work for Hawaiian Airlines and fly back and forth from Hawaii whenever needed.Then, that Christmas, Aaron proposed to Christian while in the kitchen of their new home.“I knew here in the kitchen was the most perfect place, just us and our cat – he was our witness,” says Aaron.There was “lots of crying, lots of laughing,” he says.“I was really surprised. And I felt very happy,” says Christian. She and Aaron had talked about marriage, but she wasn’t expecting a proposal that day. It was low key, intimate and perfect.Aaron set up his iPad to record the moment, but the video didn’t work – the recording cut out right before the proposal.“But then I remember thinking that, you know, that just makes this moment ours,” says Aaron. “So it’s kind of more special.”The following year, Aaron and Christian got married in Hawaii, on the island of Oahu –not far from where they’d first met at the airport.“The theme was ‘love is in the air,’” says Christian, who took Aaron’s name when she got married, becoming Christian Maluo. “It was a vintage travel-themed wedding.”Before the wedding, the couple organized a photoshoot at Honolulu Airport.“We took pictures everywhere that we’d walked that first time that we met,” Christian recalls. “Being that our story was so much about flights and airports, I thought it was just perfect to have a travel-themed wedding.”The wedding decor incorporated the travel theme too, with airplanes and world flags hanging from the ceiling.Today, Christian and Aaron live together in Portland, Oregon with their son Cruz, who just turned one.When they got married, Christian and Aaron knew they wanted to have children, but it was a little while before Cruz came along.Christian calls their son “a miracle.”“I think something with us is that timing played a huge role in everything all along,” she says. “And the same with Cruz – we were just waiting for him, and he took a long time, and then he seemed to come at the perfect time.”Christian and Aaron remain avid Oregon State football fans – they often attend home games, and occasionally travel to away games too, with their son in tow too.“He goes to all the games with us, he has little headphones to block the sound,” says Christian, who suspects Cruz will take after his parents when it comes to a love of travel.“We’re hoping and looking forward to taking him to even more places together,” she says.Today, when Christian’s cheering on Oregon State, her arms around Aaron, holding on to Cruz, she sometimes feels emotional, thinking how all this happened “just because I went for a walk with a stranger in an airport.”She says reflecting on meeting Aaron at Honolulu Airport, in the wake of her mother’s death, is a reminder that sometimes “all the pieces will fall into place, if you just let them and never force anything, just let things roll out in front of you. And it can just be a beautiful story. It just was different than what you were expecting.”Aaron says that day at the airport, he and Christian were “just two people just trying to keep going forward, and just trying to find what they’re looking for.”Christian agrees.“Meeting Aaron just felt exactly what my heart and my soul needed after the rough year. And I just think it was just my life unveiling itself,” she says."

        "text": "Warm thoughts of young romance – not the cold, harsh possibilities of a Midwestern road trip in winter – were on Dawn O’Hair’s mind as she left Chicago for Indianapolis to see her boyfriend.Her weekend visit, back in the winter of 1997-98, did not go well. After a spat with her beau, O’Hair got back into her car very early on a Monday morning to return to Chicago and her job.She should have stayed put. The 23-year-old was driving up Interstate 65 straight into a blizzard.“I ended up in whiteout conditions. I had trouble maintaining control in my 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier,” she said. “The wind was crazy. The snow was blowing sideways. It was super hard to see. It was horrible.”“I got nervous and decided to pull over [but] my car got stuck,” she said. “I didn’t know what to do. I got out and tried to figure out a way to get traction, but without luck.”And there she was – in a real mess. She hadn’t checked the forecasts. She had nothing particularly warm to wear. No blankets. No winter kit. Just her Chevy and time to ponder how things went so wrong so fast.O’Hair’s story is a far too common one of people caught off guard by a blizzard or some other onslaught of wintry weather.Blizzards can happen over a surprisingly wide range of the calendar – just ask these runners caught in a blizzard in October in Utah in 2021.Of course, we expect rough winter weather in January. And on the first days of January 2024, a second monster winter storm with possibly dangerous blizzards in portions of it threatened much of the central and eastern United States.Unless you live in a year-round warm climate and plan to stay there, it’s important to know how winter storms behave, how to avoid and prepare for them, and heaven forbid, what to do in the worst-case scenario.First, not every ol’ winter storm is technically a blizzard.The National Weather Service says a blizzard must have large amounts of falling snow or blowing snow, winds greater than 35 mph (56 kph) and visibility of less than a quarter mile (0.4 km) for at least three hours. A ground blizzard has no falling snow; instead, it blows around snow that had fallen before the blizzard kicked up.Any weather system with below freezing temperatures along with snow and ice can be a safety hazard. Blizzards, however, are one of the most dangerous types of winter storms.They can lead not only “to perilous driving conditions under low visibility and snow-covered roads, but can also lead to disorientation for anyone walking or driving, resulting in the person not knowing where they are or where they are going,” said Michael Muccilli, meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s NWS, in an email interview with CNN Travel.“Oftentimes the strong winds and cold temperatures associated with blizzards can produce dangerous wind chills, which can lead to hypothermia and frostbite, especially if stuck outside for extended periods,” he said.Awareness and avoidance are your best weapons against blizzards and other bad winter weather.If you’re taking a road trip, “begin checking weather conditions about a week in advance of your trip and make sure to check again each day as the weather forecasts become more fine-tuned,” Muccilli said.“Have alternate plans for your travel, and if weather conditions are looking increasingly unfavorable, use those alternate plans or delay travel.”Muccilli said you should check conditions along your entire route, not just the starting and ending points, especially if you’re crossing through high mountain passes.If you’re going hiking or camping, checking forecasts is a must, said Beth Pratt, the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation.Don’t skip a forecast check just because it’s fall, spring or even summer in some locations. They can lull you into a false sense of security because your guard might not be up as much as the dead of winter, Pratt said.She resides on the border of Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevadas, where you might start out on a hike on a late fall day while it’s still warm but suddenly encounter a dangerous wintry blast.NOAA has nine winter forecast tools you can check online to see what might be ahead.A little geographical and climate knowledge helps, too.“Blizzards are most common in the upper Midwest and Great Plains in the United States, but can occur in most areas of the country except the Gulf Coast and coastal California,” Muccilli said. Elsewhere in the world, you’ll encounter them most often in Russia, central and northeastern Asia (including China), northern Europe, Canada and Antarctica.Just as it’s important to know blizzards aren’t a winter-only event, you must also realize they might happen in places you usually associate with hot weather.Iran was struck by a 1972 blizzard that killed thousands. At least four people died in Spain early in 2021 in a rare blizzard. And parts of inland Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas were slammed by blizzard conditions in the 1993 storm of the century.Having the right clothing is crucial if you’re going to a place where blizzards and other cold-weather storms might happen.The American Red Cross says to “wear layered clothing, mittens or gloves, and a hat. Outer garments should be tightly woven and water repellent. Mittens or gloves and a hat will prevent the loss of body heat.”Remember O’Hair’s predicament. It’s important to bring along winter clothing even if it’s not that cold or threatening as you depart or you just plan on staying in your car.Layering is important, says the Massachusetts government website: “Dress in several layers of loose-fitting, lightweight clothing instead of a single heavy layer.”Minnesota’s state government points out another reason to layer: You might need to take a layer or two off to avoid overheating, perspiring too much and then subsequently getting chilled. The website advises mittens over gloves.If you’re outside, the Red Cross also says to cover your mouth to protect your lungs from severely cold air. Don’t gulp in deep breaths of frigid air and talk as little as possible.Make sure you have fully stocked safety kit before you head out. Muccilli said the kit should include:– A survival blanket– Road salt and a shovel– A scraper– Jumper cables– Drinking water– A repair kit– A flashlight and road flares– A cell phone chargerYou should also fill your wiper fluid and check your tire pressure, tire tread and oil before leaving. Make sure your phone is fully charged.What if you run into bad winter weather?“If the weather becomes too severe to continue driving, pull over, and if possible move your car to the closest gas station or hotel and ride out the storm,” Muccilli said. Don’t drive around barriers onto closed-off roads.What if your car is stuck in the snow?If conditions are safe enough, you can “attempt to shovel out your tires and throw down sand, rock salt, dirt, cardboard or kitty litter to give your vehicle more traction. If this does not work, call for roadside assistance or emergency services.”Otherwise, Muccilli said stay inside your vehicle except long enough to set road flares or put out a colorful cloth to make yourself visible. Contact emergency services with as much information about your situation as you can.The NWS advises not to leave your vehicle to walk for help during a blizzard. You could get disoriented. You should run the motor about 10 minutes each hour for heat, it says, but open the window a crack for fresh air. Clear snow away from the exhaust pipe if possible.Whether you are camping, hiking, backcountry skiing or doing other similar types of outside activities, carry the correct safety gear. Muccilli said this might include but is not limited to:– Proper footwear – Enough water and food– A headlamp and a lighter– A whistle– A first aid kit– A map or other navigation tools– A transceiver to transmit your location in case you are trapped in an avalanche– A probe to pinpoint your exact location– A shovel to dig out– An airbag pack to increase your chances of staying near the surface of an avalanche.“Never hike or ski alone and make sure someone knows where you are going,” he said.People enjoying a day (or night) at a ski resort should check the local weather forecast just before heading out to the slopes, said Rick Shandler, national program director of the Safety Team at National Ski Patrol.He cautions skiers to not let their investment in a pricey lift ticket cloud their judgment.“People want to get the most value out of their lift tickets and may stay out past what common sense dictates” when blizzards, dense fog or other bad weather is approaching, he said.He suggested taking the following with you on the slopes:– A fully charged cell phone in an inner pocket. The cold can quickly sap your battery if it’s in an outer pocket. Get the number of the ski patrol at the resort before you head out and add it to your phone.– A whistle. The sound carries farther than yelling if you’re down and a ski patrol needs to find you.– A space blanket. Made of Mylar, they are inexpensive, easy to tote and can keep you warmer and easier to spot if you become stranded.Pratt said the closest she ever came to dying in a blizzard was in her college years back in 1990. It was in June of all months, while she was hiking with two friends on Mount Washington in New Hampshire.The mountain is notorious for its dangerous, fickle weather, even in summer.“The storm came up very fast. We were in college, and young and broke and didn’t have great gear either.”With the wind whipping and whiteout conditions of a blizzard, “the only thing that saved us is we found the tracks to the Mount Washington Cog Railway. So we had breadcrumbs to follow. If we had not been near those train tracks, we would have had to hunker down. The wind was so fierce it had shredded our rain gear.”What if you end up in a worst-case scenario like Pratt? She said there are “two things to focus on: Stay warm and stay still.”“It’s ill-advised to walk yourself out of a blizzard. Navigation is tough, and you burn more energy when you are cold, so conserve it. Find shelter. If there is none to find, build a snow cave if there’s enough snow. Wait it out.”The NWS has some additional advice for dire situations when it’s just you vs. the raw elements:– Try to find shelter: Also, attempt to stay dry and cover all of your body.– Can’t find shelter? See if you can make a lean-to, windbreak or snow cave for protection from the wind. Try to set a fire. If there are rocks nearby, put those around the fire to retain heat. Global Rescue says even low-hanging tree branches could provide some protection.– Out of water? You should melt snow for drinking water. The NWS and Global Rescue warn that eating unmelted snow will lower your body temperature.– Strategic exercise: From time to time, move your arms, legs, fingers and toes to keep your blood pumping and stay warm. But don’t overdo it. “The strain from the cold and the hard labor may cause a heart attack. Sweating could lead to a chill and hypothermia,” the NWS website says.Fortunately for Dawn O’Hair, what she lacked in winter preparation she made up for in a good decision, good luck and good connections with people in northern Indiana.She wisely stayed with her car instead of walking off into the blizzard for help.Less than an hour later, a young woman pulled up and offered her a ride to a gas station. That woman had a boyfriend who was a police officer, and he took her to an Indiana state police post. From the post, she was able to reach a cousin to give her refuge and was transported to that cousin’s house via snowmobile.It ended up taking her several days and more on-the-road misadventures to make the roughly 170-mile drive back home.So what did Dawn O’Hair Czanik – yes, she ended up marrying the boyfriend with whom she had the spat – learn from the experience?“I would have paid more attention to the weather forecast and planned ahead better! I probably would have left the day before, but young love is kinda stupid, ya know?”"

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "There are more than 8 billion people in the world. And about a quarter of them are fasting from sunup to sundown. Every day. For an entire month.It’s Ramadan, and it’s the holiest month of the Muslim calendar. In 2024, it runs from March 10 to April 19.But what if you’re not a Muslim and instead just a caring, considerate person. Is there anything you should do so you don’t come across as insensitive to your fasting friends in the United States or abroad during Ramadan?Short answer: No. Long answer: No.But you can earn some cool points if you follow these 10 tips:For the 30 days of Ramadan, Muslims around the world will abstain from eating and drinking during daylight hours. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t carry on business as usual. (Just turn a deaf ear to our growling stomachs.)If you have to host a brown-bag, you should. But don’t feel bad if we sit there, like a vegetarian friend at a churrascaria. Ditto for a happy-hour mixer. If your Muslim co-worker takes a pass, understand.You can if you want to see what it feels like. But it’s not going to hurt our feelings – even if we’re best friends.Iftar is the breaking of the fast after sundown. We like to make it a big communal meal. You should come.Ramadan isn’t like Christmas or Thanksgiving, as in everyone knows exactly when it’ll fall. It bounces around, because the Islamic calendar is lunar. When it begins depends on when the new moon is seen. That’s why the precise dates change from year to year.How we determine when Ramadan begins is decidedly old-school: You have to physically see the moon (even though there are apps for that). That’s why, if your co-worker says, “Starting tomorrow, can I start work early so I can leave sooner?” try to accommodate.No, we can’t drink. Not even water. But we’ll walk with you if you want to take a break.One word: Halitosis. You try not eating or drinking for the entire day. That’s why we’re standing a foot away from you when we talk.There’s no “war on Christmas”-level controversy surrounding the greeting (it means “Happy Ramadan”). Your Muslim co-worker will appreciate the thoughtfulness.Ramadan’s not about that. Plus, one of Ramadan’s side effects is obesity (it’s all that post-sundown overeating)."

        "title": "World’s best spicy foods: 20 dishes to try",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Some like it hot – and some like it hotter, still.When it comes to the world’s best spicy dishes, we have some of the world’s hottest peppers to thank, along with incredible layers of flavor and a long, spice-loving human history.“Spicy food, or at least spiced foods, clearly predates the idea of countries and their cuisine by a very, very long time,” says Indian author Saurav Dutt, who is writing a book about the spiciest foods on the Indian subcontinent.“Every spicy ingredient has a wild ancestor,” he says. “Ginger, horseradish, mustard, chiles and so on have predecessors which led to their domestication.”Hunter-gatherer groups historically made use of various wild ingredients to flavor their foods, Dutt says, and there are many ingredients all over the world that can lend a spicy taste to a dish or stand on their own.Peppers – a headliner for heat – are rated on the Scoville Heat Units scale, which measures capsaicin and other active components of chile peppers. By that measure, the Carolina Reaper is among the hottest in the world, while habaneros, Scotch bonnets and bird’s eye chiles drop down a few rungs on the mop-your-brow scale.Redolent with ghost peppers, Scotch bonnets, serranos, chiltepin peppers, mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns and more, the following spicy dishes from around the world bring the heat in the most delicious way.Ata rodo – Scotch bonnet pepper – brings the fire to Nigeria’s famous spicy soup. Egusi is made by pounding the seeds from the egusi melon, an indigenous West African fruit that’s related to the watermelon.In addition to being protein-packed, the melon’s seeds serve to thicken and add texture and flavor to the soup’s mix of meat, seafood and leafy vegetables. Pounded yams are often served alongside this dish, helping to temper the scorch of the Scotch bonnets.“The joy of this dish is not only the delightful warming ingredients of cinnamon, cloves, star anise and, of course, the Sichuan peppercorns, but the fact that you can cook exactly what you like in the bubbling spicy broth,” says British-born Chinese chef Kwoklyn Wan, author of “The Complete Chinese Takeout Cookbook.”Duck, seafood, chicken, pork, lamb and seasonal vegetables are all fair game for tossing into the pot to simmer in a mouth-numbing broth made with Sichuan peppercorns and dried Sichuan peppers for serious kick (the dipping sauce served on the side often has chile paste, too).Also known as Chongqing hot pot, the dish is said to have originated as a popular food among Yangtze River boatmen. It’s enjoyed by those who can handle its heat all over China, not to mention elsewhere around the world.From northeastern Thailand’s spice-loving Isaan province, this fresh and fiery salad is a staple dish at Thai restaurants around the world and is also popular in neighboring Laos.Som tam turns to green (unripe) papaya for its main ingredient, which is usually julienned or shredded for the salad. The papaya is then tossed with long beans or green beans and a mix of flavorful Asian essentials that include tamarind juice, dried shrimp, fish sauce and sugar cane paste, among other ingredients. Thai chiles, also called bird’s eye chiles, give the salad its requisite kick.The Portuguese introduced this spicy dish also known as peri-peri chicken into Angola and Mozambique as far back as the 15th century, when they mixed African chiles with European ingredients (piri-piri means “pepper pepper” in Swahili). And it’s the perky red pepper of the same name that brings the spiciness to this complex, layered and delicious dish.Piri-piri chicken’s poultry cuts are marinated in chiles, olive oil, lemon, garlic and herbs such as basil and oregano for a fiery flavor that blends salty, sour and sweet. The dish is also popular in Namibia and South Africa, where it’s often found on the menu in Portuguese restaurants.The glossy red hues dancing on a plate of this popular pork dish, a version of which hails from Mao Zedong’s home province, give a hint about the mouth experience to come. The dish was apparently a favorite of the communist leader, who requested his chefs in Beijing prepare it for him.Chairman Mao’s braised pork belly – called Mao shi hong shao rou in China – is often served as the main dish for sharing at a family table and is made by braising chunks of pork belly with soy sauce, dried chiles and spices.“It is a very delicious and moreish dish due to the caramelized sugar and dark soy sauce being reduced and all the aromatics (that coat the pork belly),” wrote BBC “Best Home Cook” winner Suzie Lee, author of “Simply Chinese,” in an email to CNN Travel.Jamaica’s favorite pepper is the Scotch bonnet, beloved not just for its spiciness but for its aroma, colors and flavor, too, says Mark Harvey, content creator and podcaster at Two On An Island, who was born in Spanish Town, Jamaica.“For Jamaicans, the degree of spiciness starts at medium for children and goes up to purple hot,” he says, explaining that the peppers come in green, orange, red and purple hues, growing increasingly spicy in that order.Scotch bonnets star in several of the island’s iconic dishes, including escovitch fish, pepper pot soup and curry goat. But you might recognize them most from the ubiquitous jerk chicken and pork smoking roadside everywhere from Montego Bay to Boston Bay, where meat prepared with the peppery marinade is cooked the traditional way, atop coals from pimento tree wood (the tree’s allspice berries are also used in the jerk marinade).Popular on the Indonesian islands of Bali and Lombok, in particular, this whole chicken dish is stuffed with an intensely aromatic spice paste (betutu) that usually includes a mashup of fresh hot chile peppers, galangal (a root related to ginger), candlenuts, shallots, garlic, turmeric and shrimp paste, among other ingredients.The chicken is then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed, bringing the aromatics out all the more and flavoring the chicken to the max. Best shared, ayam betutu is often presented at religious ceremonies in Bali, but you’ll find it at restaurants specializing in it throughout the islands, too.Beer and buffalo chicken wings are as American as, well, hamburgers. And if you’re not eating them alongside a pile of celery sticks and a ramekin of dunking sauce – traditionally blue cheese dip, but ranch works, too – you’re missing half the picture.A sports bar staple at chain restaurants such as Buffalo Wild Wings and more refined outposts, too, from Alaska to Maine, “wings” are actually made up of the wing parts called drumettes and wingettes, which have the most meat.Buffalo wings, said to have been invented in a bar in Buffalo, New York, in 1964, are among the spiciest preparations (other popular variations include teriyaki wings and honey garlic wings). Make them as fiery as you like using a sauce that includes cayenne pepper, butter, vinegar, garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce.Similar to ceviche but with more bite, this raw marinated shrimp dish from the western Mexican state of Sinaloa (and a staple along the Baja Peninsula, too) tastes as good as it looks.Tiny but mighty chiltepín peppers (they look like bright little berries), grown throughout the United States and Mexico, make the spicy magic happen in shrimp aguachiles, which means “pepper water.” If you can’t find those, serrano and jalapeño peppers also do the trick.Marinate the raw shrimp with ingredients including lime juice, cilantro, red onion and cucumber and enjoy with crispy tostadas.A go-to dish when you want something satisfying – but with kick – pad ka prao is a mealtime staple in Thailand, where you’ll find it on offer at street-side stalls and restaurants everywhere from Bangkok to the islands.Considered the Thai equivalent of a sandwich or a burger, the dish is a mix of ground pork, spicy Thai chile peppers and holy basil and can be ordered as spicy as you like. Many locals believe it’s best topped with a fried egg with a runny yolk.A fiery favorite that originated in West Sumatra, versions of beef rendang are also enjoyed in Indonesia’s neighboring countries, including Malaysia and Brunei, as well as the Philippines.This flavorful dry curry dish calls on kaffir lime leaves, coconut milk, star anise and red chile, among other spices, to deliver its complexity. It’s often presented to guests and served during festive events.The fermented cabbage dish kimchi might be the spicy Korean dish that first comes to mind, but when you want some extra kick, dakdoritang does the trick.Comfort food to the max, the chicken stew doubles down on its spiciness with liberal doses of gochugaru (Korean chile powder) and gochujang (Korean chile paste) mixed with rice wine, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and sesame oil in a braising sauce that packs the bone-in chicken pieces with flavor. It’s often served with carrots, onions and potatoes.This tomato-based British-Asian curry invented in Birmingham, England, curry houses by British Bangladeshi restaurateurs is thought to be one of the spiciest curries in the world.“Typically the sauce has a tomato base with ginger, fennel seeds and copious amounts of chile, habanero or Scotch bonnet, peppers,” says Indian author Saurav Dutt.As many as 10 pepper types may find their way into phaal curry, he says, including bird’s eye chiles and the bhut jolokia (also known as the ghost pepper, it’s one of the world’s hottest peppers). Even hotter than vindaloo, this dish will absolutely light your mouth up.This classic Roman pasta dish’s name gives you an idea of what to expect. “Arrabbiata” means “angry” in Italian. And penne all’arrabbiata pairs the relatively plain penne pasta with fiery flavors from the sauce (sugo all’arrabbiata) in which it’s slathered.“The peperoncino (red chile pepper) is what makes this sauce ‘angry’ (arrabbiata) or spicy,” Chris MacLean of Italy-based Open Tuesday Wines said via email.To tame the angry peppers in this garlic and tomato-based dish with a good glass of red wine, MacLean says to pair penne all’arrabbiata with a Cesanese, also from Rome’s Lazio region, with its crisp fruit and light tannins.“A wine that’s heavy in oak or alcohol would turn up the heat (in the dish) in your mouth and render the wine tasteless,” he warns.“There’s a saying in South India that you are lucky to ‘eat like a Chettiar,’ ” says Dutt, referring to the Tamil-speaking community in India’s southern Tamil Nadu state credited with creating this spicy dish.“Like this chicken dish, the traditional Chettinad dishes mostly used locally sourced spices like star anise, pepper, kalpasi (stone flower) and marati mokku (dried flower pods),” he says.The chicken pieces are simmered in a medley of roasted spices and coconut, and it is traditionally served with steamed rice or the thin South Indian pancakes called dosa, fried chapati or naan.The fiery Ethiopian spice blend called berbere – aromatic with chile peppers, basil, cardamom, garlic and ginger – is instrumental to the flavor chorus that’s doro wat, Ethiopia’s much-loved spicy chicken stew.Topped with boiled eggs, the dish almost always finds a place at the table during weddings, religious holidays and other special occasions and family gatherings. If you’re invited to try it in Ethiopia at such an event, consider yourself very lucky indeed.Mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns bring the X-factor to this popular dish from China’s Sichuan province, which mixes chunks of silken tofu with ground meat (pork or beef) and a spicy fermented bean paste called doubanjiang.Mapo tofu’s fiery red color might as well be a warning to the uninitiated – Sichuan cuisine’s defining flavor, málà, has a numbing effect on the mouth called paresthesia that people tend to love or hate.A Portuguese-influenced dish from India’s southwestern state of Goa, vindaloo was not originally meant to be spicy, says Dutt. “It originally contained pork, potatoes (aloo) and vinegar (vin), giving you the name,” he says.But when the dish was exported to curry houses in the United Kingdom that were mostly run by Muslim Bangladeshi chefs, Dutt says, pork was replaced with beef, chicken or lamb and the dish evolved into a spicier hot curry.Ghost pepper flakes and Scotch bonnet peppers are among the peppers giving the dish its scorching taste. But in Goa, you can still find versions of the dish that swing more on the side of milder spices such as cinnamon and cardamom.Senegalese cooks are also big fans of Scotch bonnet peppers, named for their resemblance to the Scottish tam o’ shanter hat. And their spice-giving goodness is deployed liberally in one of the West African country’s favorite dishes, the spicy tomato and peanut or groundnut-based stew called mafé.Usually made with beef, lamb or chicken, the stew is made even heartier with potatoes, carrots and other root vegetables for one filling feed. Mafé is popular in other West African countries, too, including Mali and Gambia, and it can also be prepared without meat.Synonymous with watching the Super Bowl or hunkering down on a cold night, chili is a spicy American staple where you can opt to ratchet up the heat as much as you like.There are basically two pure forms of American chili – with or without beans (usually red kidney beans) – says Chef Julian Gonzalez of Sawmill Market in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In Texas, he explains, chili traditionally doesn’t have beans, which puts the focus on the spices and chiles used to flavor it, and he goes with that approach himself.“Traditionally chili is seasoned with chili powder, cumin and paprika,” Gonzalez says. From there, you can use other ingredients to make your recipe unique. Adding cayenne pepper is one way to turn up the heat.At his restaurant Red & Green, which serves New Mexican cuisine, Gonzalez’s green chile stew, made with pork and no beans, is seasoned with a mix of roasted green New Mexican hatch chiles (half mild and half with heat), onion and garlic powder."

        "title": "She moved to Italy and bought a palazzo for a fresh start. Her ex-husband came with her",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "As they walked through the stunning palazzo and gazed up at its frescoed ceilings, Kelly and Jesse Galloway, originally from Australia, knew that their lives were about to change.The pair, who’ve been divorced since 2013, decided to purchase the historic property, situated in the village of Stimigliano in the central Lazio region of Italy, almost instantly.“The agent led us through this covered walkway, opened the door and brought us into this beautiful big kitchen,” Kelly, a former furniture manufacturer, tells CNN Travel.“Then [we went] through the kitchen and into the main entrance, and I stood and looked up the staircase and began to cry.”Kelly and Jess, who were previously married for 18 years, are now the proud owners of Palazzo Menichelli, which had been left empty for around three decades.So how did this former couple end up moving to a new country and buying a palazzo – a grand Italian residence - together?“We’ve been platonic for many years,” explains Kelly. “But we’re good friends. And I saw it as a chance for Jess to have a home of his own and for me to have a home of my own and [for us to] live happy ever after in this beautiful place.”Kelly had dreamed of a “happy ever after” in Italy long before she’d ever even visited the European country and originally planned to relocate there in 2014.However, things didn’t work out on that occasion and her dream “got put back on the shelf.”When she traveled to Italy for the first time in 2018, Kelly says she fell in love with the country “more than ever.”By the following year, her home in Australia was on the market and she’d put down a deposit on a palazzo located in the town of Alvito in the Lazio region.But as the global Covid-19 pandemic developed, Kelly became nervous about taking on such a big project and pulled out of the deal.Despite this setback, she was determined to move to Italy as soon as she could, and decided to ask Jess if he’d be willing come along to help her settle in.“I had said that I thought he might end up deciding that he wanted to stay in Italy,” she says. “So he came with me under that set of circumstances.”Kelly goes on to explain that she and Jess, who have three children, stayed close after their split, and continued to work together.“We still dabbled in a lot of stuff together and sometimes traveled together to deliver things and so on,” she adds.In July 2020, the pair flew to Italy with two greyhounds, Vonny and Gooee, in tow.Although Jess, who’d never traveled to Italy before then, only intended to stay for a short time, he became “besotted” with the property, which was rebuilt by an Italian family named the Menichellis in 1901, when he and Kelly went to view it the following month.After negotiating with the owners, they agreed to buy Palazzo Menichelli for €123,000 ($132,700).“We just went to the agent’s office, went through all the documentation and signed it that night,” says Kelly.Once the sale was finalized later that year, the pair, who entered Italy with a Elective Residency Visa, a long-stay permit for non-EU citizens who intend to take residence in Italy, which requires a passive income of €31,000 (about $33,600,) spent the next few weeks getting to know the area and making plans.“There was always the proviso that we could cast his [Jess’s] name off the contract if he ever changed his mind,” Kelly explains. “I looked into it, and it was relatively straightforward.”They quickly set about beginning the renovation work on the historic property, which measures around 500 square meters (5,400 sq ft) and has a rooftop terrace that stretches across entire top floor.“The place was in such fundamentally good condition, which was kind of amazing because it was so cheap,” says Kelly.Kelly and Jess went on to complete most of the work themselves over the next three years, transforming a huge empty space into a functioning kitchen, giving the bathrooms a facelift and painting the huge property’s many walls.According to Jess, one of the hardest jobs was building a garden “from scratch” and creating a landscaped space.“That garden has been quite a challenge, because it was ‘crazy paving,’ which is random pieces of stone,” he says. “And there was absolutely no earth.”Once Kelly and Jess began working on the interior of the property, they discovered many more frescoes that were painted over and have been painstakingly removing the paint in order to restore them.“The removing of the paint over the frescoes is a long-term project,” explains Kelly, acknowledging that some areas may be “unfeasible to do.”“We’ll keep persisting with that.”Aside from this, they have pretty much completed the work on the six-level, 17-room property, which had four bedrooms, two dining rooms, two kitchens, four bathrooms and two entrances – one formal entrance and one side entrance.“It’s big, but it’s not crazy big,” says Kelly. “You hear about some palazzos over here that have 20 bedrooms.”They’ve converted one of the bedrooms into a salon/music room, where they plan to hold small concerts for family and friends and have also purchased and restored a Venetian harpsichord – a keyboard instrument that became popular during the Baroque period.Kelly and Jess have also created two new dining areas that open out onto the rear terrace.They eventually plan to transform two of the bedrooms on the second level into luxury B&B suites, and a separate section into a restaurant.Although they’ve put a lot of work into the property, Kelly and Jess feel incredibly lucky, as the process has been “so darn easy.”“So many movies have been about this hard slog renovating a place, and getting this arranged and that arranged,” says Kelly, explaining that the property didn’t require any structural, plumbing or electrical work.“And we just do it all ourselves. All we’ve got to do is the fun stuff.”They estimate that they’ve spent less than €50,000 (around $54,000) on materials, such as paint, so far.While Jess had only planned to stay in Italy for a short time, he’s taken to the country immensely and feels settled in Stimigliano, which is located just an hour from Rome.“Everyone’s been extremely friendly and helpful,” says Jess. “It’s a really great community.”However, the pair admit that they’ve found learning Italian and communicating with the locals to be hugely challenging.“I’m quite shy,” says Kelly. “So I sort of feel embarrassed. I beat myself up a lot, because I don’t understand as much of what the locals are saying.”And while Jess has been picking words up along the way and can “sort of scrape by” at the supermarket, he’s far from fluent.Kelly concedes that they haven’t been able to socialize with locals as much as they would have liked, partly due to the language barrier, as well as the fact that they arrived during the pandemic and spend much of their time working on the property.“I’d be lying if I told you that we go to lots of get togethers with locals and we all go around to each other’s houses,” she says. “That hasn’t really happened very much.“But we do go to all of the local events. And the wonderful thing about little Italian towns is that there’s constantly events going on.”Kelly’s been hugely impressed by the warmth and kindness of the local community, describing how their neighbors will sometimes ”turn up at our door and give us a lasagna,” because they often “make dozens and hand them to friends.”“Things like that blow me away,” she says, adding that Jess often finds himself being handed a free coffee or bottle of wine while out and about.Kelly loves the slower pace of life in the Italian town and admits that she sometimes felt like a “duck out of water” while living Down Under.“I was a terrible fit for Australia,” says Kelly, who was based just outside of the city of Melbourne before moving to Italy.“Australia is kind of painted as this place where it’s a very chill life. In reality, it’s very ‘rush.’“You’re always kind of working for something. Whereas here, you’re in this tiny little town and everybody sort of knows each other.“And if you’re walking past, everybody says ‘hello’ and they just give each other a helping hand.“It’s like something out of a fairytale book. It really is.”While she notes that some expats living in the country take exception to Italian bureaucracy, Kelly refuses to let it get to her.“People complain about the bureaucracy,” she says. “But what I point out is, we spend a tiny fraction of our time each year dealing with bureaucracy and 99% of our time just living this beautiful life in this beautiful place.”Their four-legged companion Vonny has also adapted to his new home well. Sadly Kelly’s dog Gooee, who also traveled to Italy with them, passed away last March.Although she and Jess are very happy with their setup, Kelly admits that their platonic relationship can cause confusion, particularly when meeting strangers.“I guess we’ve got better at dealing with it,” she says, stressing how well they’ve always worked together as a team.“But I’m 60 and Jess is now 62. Pardon my bluntness, but at our age a lot of people aren’t doing much anyway. So we’re kind of like a lot of married couples would be at this point.“Unless somebody specifically points out otherwise, it’s not something that we really think about.”While she’d talked of moving to Italy for many years, Kelly says that many of her friends back home didn’t take her seriously, and even her family question it at times.“Everybody said, ‘No, it won’t happen.’” she says. “But once I sold my house, they knew that I was definitely coming over here.”Kelly stresses that their children are thrilled by the way that things have worked out for she and Jess and their son is planning to come over to visit at some point this year.“He would be on the next plane to get here if he could,” she says, before explaining that their two daughters are less enthusiastic about making the long trip from Australia to Italy.Kelly points out that she’s seen a number of expats return to their home country after moving to Italy, with one of the main reasons being the aforementioned bureaucracy.She goes on to explain that the fact that most expats from outside the EU can only use their driving license for a year before having to obtain an Italian driving license, which involves taking the Italian driving test, is another factor.“Things like that, people kind of dwell on,” she says. “And they end up being the reasons that they go back.“What I would say to people is, ‘Just don’t worry about that.’ It’s such a little part of your life.“Some people adore life here and some people end up literally hating it because they focus on those two things.”Thankfully, both she and Jess are focused on little else but completing the work on their treasured palazzo, and making the most of their new life in Italy, a place that Kelly had fantasized about for so long.“It’s hard to imagine anywhere else being home other than this place for either of us anymore,” she adds."

        "title": "London’s futuristic BT Tower landmark to become hotel",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Tourists who fancy getting a top-down view of London may soon be able to book themselves a room in the city’s famous BT Tower.A much-loved part of the London skyline, the former communication tower has just been sold for £275 million ($347 million) to MCR Hotels, which plans to open it up to the public by “repurposing it as a hotel.”According a statement from telecom company BT Group on Wednesday, the sale is “securing its (the tower’s) place as a London landmark for the future.”When the building was completed in 1964 it overtook the Millbank Tower in Westminster to become the British capital’s tallest structure. Situated in Fitzrovia, central London, it was officially opened by the then-prime minister, Harold Wilson, the following year. The main structure is 581 feet (177 meters) high, but an additional section of aerial rigging brings it up to 620 feet.Originally known as the Post Office Tower, the building was designed to relay microwave signals carrying telecommunications from London around the country. However, it has gradually been replaced by the company’s fixed and mobile networks. Its dish-like microwave aerials were removed more than 10 years ago as they were no longer needed.It remained London’s tallest building until 1980, when it was overtaken by the NatWest Tower in the financial district. Both have since been massively eclipsed by the Shard, which towers over the city at 1,016 feet (310 meters) high.The building, which has a grade II listing from national heritage body Historic England, was open to the public for several years, with a restaurant on a revolving floor at the top.In 1971, however, it closed to the public after a bomb explosion on the 31st floor, for which nobody ever claimed responsibility.In 2009, an LED screen was wrapped around the 36th and 37th floors, with a message proclaiming 1,000 days until the 2012 London Olympics. The “information band,” as it is known, has since been used to display many different messages, including the late Queen’s first tweet, in 2014, and advice to “Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives” during the coronavirus pandemic.In a press release announcing the sale of the site, Brent Mathews, property director for BT Group, said the company had been “immensely proud” to own the “important landmark.”He added: “It’s played a vital role in carrying the nation’s calls, messages and TV signals, but increasingly we’re delivering content and communication via other means. This deal with MCR will enable BT Tower to take on a new purpose, preserving this iconic building for decades to come.”This latest addition will bump up MCR’s portfolio of around 150 luxury hotels, including the TWA Hotel at New York’s JFK airport, a reimagining of Eero Saarinen’s 1962 Flight Center.Also in the Big Apple is the Art Deco New Yorker hotel, which has a rich history and has played host to VIPs from John F. Kennedy to Muhammad Ali.Tyler Morse, CEO and owner of MCR Hotels, said in the press release: “We are proud to preserve this beloved building and will work to develop proposals to tell its story as an iconic hotel, opening its doors for generations to enjoy.”Comparing the project to the company’s transformation of the TWA Flight Center, Morse added: “We see many parallels between the TWA Hotel and the BT Tower.“Both are world-renowned, groundbreaking pieces of architecture. It’s been a privilege to adapt the TWA Flight Center into new use for future generations, as it will be the BT Tower.”"

        "title": "The supersonic plane that was faster than Concorde",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Five years before Concorde’s first flight, another majestic supersonic aircraft took to the skies — and almost became the inspiration for an even faster passenger plane.It was the XB-70 Valkyrie, an experimental plane developed for the US Air Force. Its inaugural flight — 60 years ago in September 1964 — kicked off a golden era for supersonic aircraft. The plane would later achieve a speed of just over 2,000 miles per hour, nearly 50% faster than Concorde.“The overall design of the XB-70 was a thing of beauty,” says Tony Landis, a historian at the Air Force Materiel Command in Dayton, Ohio. “To think such an attractive aircraft, with its speed and altitude capabilities, was built over 65 years ago is hard to comprehend in today’s AI and computer-based engineering environment.”The XB-70 program was not without problems: As a military plane, it was obsolete before it was even rolled out, and its short lifespan was marred by a tragic accident. Even regular flights had everyone on edge, as the aircraft’s components were all pushed to the limits.However, its design has made it an icon of supersonic flight: “To this day, people stop and stare at the Valkyrie parked majestically at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, admiring its size and shape,” Landis says. “Most people ask if this is a new design, as they’ve never seen anything like it.”The plane was born out of a competition between Boeing and North American Aviation, then a major aerospace manufacturer that was eventually chosen by the Air Force, in 1957, to develop a bomber capable of carrying nuclear weapons at Mach 2 and 60,000 feet of altitude.However, the downing of an American U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union in 1960 caused a shift from manned bombers to ballistic missiles, and in 1961 President Kennedy billed the upcoming XB-70 as having little chance of penetrating enemy defenses successfully. As a result, just as North American was starting to build the aircraft, the goal of the program shifted to high-speed flight research.The first XB-70 — nicknamed Valkyrie following a naming contest — was rolled out in Palmdale, California, on May 11, 1964. With a wingspan of over 100 feet, six General Electric turbojet engines at the back, and 185 feet long, it was easily one of the most impressive planes ever built.Among its distinctive features were wingtips that remained horizontal at subsonic speeds, but folded down once supersonic to reduce drag. Its main design elements, like the delta-shaped wings and the thin, long fuselage were replicated by both Concorde and its Soviet clone, the Tupolev Tu-144, which even sported two “canards” or winglets right behind the cockpit — just like the XB-70 — giving pilots more control at low speeds.“Throughout the 1960s, both the military and civil sector put vast amounts of resources into developing a supersonic transport,” says Landis. “In the early stages, nearly every aircraft company based its initial design around the XB-70.”As more information became available, Landis adds, these designs morphed into more refined designs like Concorde, as well as other projects that remained on paper, such as the planned Concorde rivals imagined by Lockheed and Boeing.Once it was clear that the Valkyrie’s role as a bomber was set aside, its designers came up with alternative uses for the plane: “North American engineers became very creative, with many different uses for the aircraft,” says Landis, “But the only variant to be given serious consideration was the transport version for military and civilian use.”Three variations were proposed, ranging from a high-density one with capacity for 158 passengers, to a “deluxe” arrangement that allowed for 114 seats and included a lounge area in the center of the passenger compartment.“While the first XB-70 was back at Palmdale for inspections and upgrades, North American took the opportunity to add fake window markings to one side of the aircraft to assist in the marketing of the transport variant. The windows were removed prior to the aircraft’s return to flight testing,” Landis says.It’s hard to imagine what the passenger experience could have been like on such a plane, but according to Landis it would have been a lot like Concorde: “Smooth, quiet, with ample space between the seats. Due to the expense in operating the aircraft and limited seating, the cost would most likely be affordable only to the upper middle class and the wealthy.”Most importantly, it would have been fast, connecting London and New York in just two and a half hours, compared to Concorde’s typical three and a half.Other proposed versions of the plane imagined it as a launch platform for orbital spacecraft and even Minuteman missiles – but just like the passenger version, these never materialized.The XB-70 program was further cut short by a fatal accident that occurred in 1966, during a photoshoot organized by General Electric. The second, and more advanced, of the two existing Valkyries collided in midair with a smaller plane, an F-104N, killing its pilot as well as one of the XB-70’s own pilots, with the other surviving with serious injuries.The destroyed Valkyrie had logged just 46 flights, and the remaining one ended its career after 83 flights — many of which with NASA as a supersonic testbed — and just over 160 hours in the air.The very last of those flights occurred on February 4, 1969, to ferry the plane from what is now NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in California to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, where the aircraft joined the collection of the Air Force Museum.While the program may not have lived up to its full potential, the XB-70’s legacy still stands, Landis says: “All large, high-speed aircraft designs benefit from the work done by the XB-70. And the data from those research flights continues to affect the design of future aircraft.”"

        "title": "‘Our dreams never came true.’ These men helped build Qatar’s World Cup, now they are struggling to survive",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Kamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.Kamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.It will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.Kamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.Describing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”Using a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”Kamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.Qatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.He says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.A Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”The official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.With the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.The Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.The report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.Hassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.A government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”It has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.Eight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.Since 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.However, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”Last year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.We are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.Hari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).After moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”During his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.He added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”Working long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.In 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.The government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”Natasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”Determining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”According to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.In its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.The statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”Amnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”Barun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”Last year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”Iskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”Knight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”For the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.His friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.Now, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.Sunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.He had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”In helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”He says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.For a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”The SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.Since 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.Qatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.The spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.Such attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.In Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”Knight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”Ghimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.Qatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”Human Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.Families of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”Ghimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”Earlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.A Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.In terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.Last month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”It has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.FIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.The motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.As NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”Hosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "He worked for the NBA, so he knows plenty about sporting audiences in the US. Now, MotoGP chief commercial officer Daniel Rossomondo is trying to work out how to capture the eyeballs of a nation with a population of over 330 million.He knows it won’t be easy, but as MotoGP returns to the track this weekend in Qatar – celebrating its 75th anniversary with what promises to be a hotly contested opener in the Lusail desert – Rossomondo believes artificial intelligence could be a trump card for the sport in the coming years.“I say all the time, we have two gladiatorial figures – we have the riders and the teams – and they’re both pushing towards the limit,” the American told CNN’s Becky Anderson from Qatar on Friday.“Now, we’ve done a lot and we continue to do a lot to ensure safety, and AI is useful in that space, so we’re constantly tracking where these guys are on the circuit, how the bikes are performing, all of our on-air graphics are generated by AI in a lot of ways.”Rossomondo views MotoGP as an “unbelievable testing ground” for tech.“Things on the bike are ultimately going to make their way onto the street, but also for tech companies to just look at what we do in terms of delivering our races in a really technologically advanced way,” he said.“AI is at the forefront of what we’re doing right now to try to figure out a way to make this sport even more attractive.”On the track this weekend, Francesco ‘Pecco’ Bagnaia will begin his bid for a third successive MotoGP title on his factory Ducati, with fans eyeing a fresh challenge from six-time champion Marc Márquez, who left Honda behind in the winter to join his brother, Álex, at the Gresini Ducati team.Jorge Martín, the charismatic Spaniard who was runner-up to Bagnaia in 2023, is expected to push the Italian hard once again, while Moto2 champion Pedro Acosta presents a mouthwatering prospect as a fresh entrant making the step up to MotoGP.The 19-year-old from Murcia is regarded as a generational talent, with many observers drawing comparisons to Márquez, who famously clinched the 2013 world title aged just 20, in his rookie year, becoming the youngest ever premier class champion.But the series made headlines off the track this week when it announced a new broadcasting deal in the United States with Warner Bros Discovery-owned TNT Sports.The deal will see all races across the season, as well as qualifying sessions, broadcast or streamed in the crucial US market.The 2024 season will also see the debut of a US based-team, Nashville’s Trackhouse Racing, which is co-owned by musician Pitbull.“[The new TV deal] is hugely significant for us,” Rossomondo said. “For us, what makes it so special is that this sport is custom made for the American audience, so we’re thrilled about that.”MotoGP saw the best attended season in its history in 2023, with three million fans going to events across the year.But the sport has struggled to make inroads in the United States, where Formula One has recently enjoyed burgeoning interest and popularity.Rossomondo, whom MotoGP rights-holder Dorna lured from the NBA last year, hopes this season will be a springboard for F1’s two-wheeled equivalent.“This sport is primed for growth,” he told CNN. “It’s a little bit of a sleeping giant, and what we want to do as we approach this 75th anniversary is innovate and do different things on the circuit, and also do different things in terms of fan engagement, in terms of delivering products to fans.“Our business is one where we want our core audience to feel like they’ve seen something special every day, but also to attract that new audience and get that new audience to be loyal fans,” added Rossomondo.Part of that revolution began last year with the controversial introduction of half-distance Sprint races.Rossomondo says these have been a hit with fans.“I have three children of my own – 14, 16 and 18 – and I know their attention spans. Both of our products, our 45-minute race on Sunday and our 24-minute race on Saturday, are custom made for today’s generation of entertainment and sports consumers.”The American sees the Sprints as a gateway to the main race for new fans.“What we wanted to do was create a product that people can use as a trial for our main race, so it’s been wildly successful, leading to over 20% global growth in our television viewership.“The teams have embraced it, the riders have embraced it and it’s going to be continued at every Grand Prix this year.”The season-opener in Qatar takes place at night, offering a unique spectacle under the lights, but also an advantage for global audiences, the American continued.He says the newly refurbished Qatar facility, which also hosts F1, is a boon for the participants, too.“Riders and teams wish that every paddock looked like this,” Rossomondo explained.“The race at night is something that was [the Qataris’] idea 20 odd years ago, and they did it.“It’s a spectacular experience for the fans here, but also for the fans all over the world, because a night race in the Middle East is a midday race in the US, a mid-afternoon race in Europe, so it’s great for all our fans.”"

        "title": "Conor McGregor: How MMA star became a figurehead for the far-right in Ireland",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "“Ireland, we are at war,” UFC star Conor McGregor declared to his millions of social media followers on November 22, 2023.It’s not clear precisely what McGregor was referring to, but this post, was viewed more than 19 million times on X, formerly known as Twitter. It was later followed by a series of tweets about immigration which were then circulated amongst Telegram channels, seen by CNN to have links to the far-right.As far back as 2022, McGregor had expressed his support for people protesting against immigration.The day after McGregor’s war tweet, a stabbing outside a school in central Dublin left three children and an adult injured. Hours later, rioters with links to the far-right descended on the city.While local media later reported the alleged attacker was a naturalized Irish citizen who came to Ireland from Algeria in 2003, misinformation alleging the assailant was a foreign national had quickly spread online.Ciarán O’Connor, a senior analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that researches online hate and disinformation, told CNN that the far-right has grown in Ireland because of social media platforms such as X and Telegram which are commonly used by extremists.“The far-right are promoting McGregor as the voice of the people, taking advantage of his platforms to boost their ideology,” O’Connor told CNN, adding that he believes McGregor’s “tweets in the lead up to the riot were a call to action against illegal immigration.”The Telegram channels that had circulated McGregor’s declaration of war the night before the stabbing claimed asylum seekers posed an innate, existential threat to Ireland’s citizens.According to the Irish government, around 500 rioters spilled into the streets of Dublin and the rampage quickly turned violent. Police cars, buses and trams were set on fire. Rioters threw fireworks, flares and bottles injuring police officers, while shops were looted causing “tens of millions” of euros in damage.One protester could be seen on video holding a sign reading “Irish Lives Matter,” while others were heard chanting anti-immigrant slogans, as “get them out” reverberated around the nation’s capital in a night of violence.Paul Murphy, a TD – a member of the Irish parliament – from the People Before Profit party, who has had members of the far-right protest outside his home in Dublin for his outspoken support of refugees, told CNN that “in terms of active members of the far-right, there’s between 200 to 300 between all far-right organizations: national, freedom party, Ireland first – form a multitude of micro far-right parties.”Despite Ireland’s two far-right parties, the Irish National Party and the Irish Freedom Party, respectively received around 0.2% and 0.3% of the vote in the 2020 general election, Murphy said the far-right are a small but growing minority.This comes after the Garda – as Ireland’s police are known – told CNN there were 231 anti-immigration related public gatherings in 2023.After the riot on November 23, 2023, police commissioner Drew Harris said, “What is clear is that people have been radicalized through social media,” before describing rioters as “a complete lunatic hooligan faction driven by far-right ideology.”As riots raged in Dublin, McGregor, posted on X, “You reap what you sow.”Local media reported this triggered a police investigation into the UFC star and others for allegedly “inciting hatred online.” The Garda told CNN that they would not comment on McGregor’s case.McGregor also took to social media to suggest that he might run for [Irish] President. The seriousness of his online claim remains unclear, though in a subsequent post McGregor positioned himself as providing “fresh skin in the game.”“These parties govern themselves vs govern the people … I listen. I support. I adapt. I have no affiliation/bias/favoritism toward any party. They would genuinely be held to account regarding the current sway of public feeling … It would not be me in power as President, people of Ireland. It would be me and you,” said McGregor.McGregor did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. However, following the Dublin riot the 35-year-old told the Guardian in a statement that, “We Irish are known for our beautiful hearts, and we have a proud history of not accepting racism.”The rise of McGregor is one of the most famous rags-to-riches stories in sports.A working-class boy from Dublin, McGregor was driven by a desire to become world champion in a sport relatively unknown in Ireland.As he started winning fights, the MMA octagon became McGregor’s colosseum. He entertained spectators with his precise boxing style and his quick wit charmed an ever-growing fan base.“The Notorious” Conor McGregor brand was born and, before long, he was the first person in history to hold two UFC belts simultaneously, rising to become the world’s highest paid sport star in 2021, according to Forbes.Yet McGregor was dogged by accusations of sexual assault, which he has denied, while a string of defeats to Khabib Nurmagomedov, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Dustin Poirier left the fighter with one title victory in the last eight years.With his fighting career in flux, McGregor has turned his attention to sparring with people on social media, which has touched a nerve in Ireland’s political establishment.Political analysts and far-right experts have told CNN that McGregor’s unique brand of Irish patriotism that won him supporters as a fighter has mutated into a strand of “far-right” Irish nationalism.“Far-right figures who do promote ethnonationalism – of Ireland for the Irish – celebrate when McGregor is becoming more aligned with their brand of nationalism,” O’Connor said.McGregor has become “a vocal anti-immigration influencer and is using his enormous reach and influence to encourage hostility and suspicion of migrants and asylum seekers,” he added.McGregor has been accused by some Irish politicians of fanning the flames of discontent online, voicing his anger at Ireland’s immigration policy and asking questions that strike at the core of Irish consciousness: does Ireland, a country with its long history of emigration, remain a country that welcomes people seeking refuge?“I think these tweets are incredibly irresponsible for someone who has ten million followers on Twitter alone to be whipping up this level of poison and hate,” Labour Justice spokesperson Aodhán Ó Ríordáin told RTÉ News last year. McGregor has said he’s being made a “scapegoat.”The former UFC champion appears to have picked his corner, in the fight for Ireland’s soul, but whether he is willingly or unwillingly platforming “far-right” views remains unclear.“When he first came to prominence in 2012, he got attention by acting like a clown – and people received him well,” Ewan MacKenna, who authored the book “Chaos is a Friend of Mine: The Life and Crimes of Conor McGregor,” told CNN.“He will become whatever the crowd wants him to be and he molds himself into whatever brings him the most attention, and with politics, it would be similar.”McGregor has previously claimed he regularly deletes his posts on X for “personal” reasons but has also said: “My statements, widely publicised, stand.”McGregor’s UFC slogan was once: “When one of us go to war, we all go to war,” and the MMA fighter has continued to evoke war imagery in recent months.“McGregor, when he first came onto the [MMA] scene, he used his sense of Irishness to portray an image of a fighting Irish warrior, but in the last couple of months, he has pivoted this towards ethno-nationalism and this idea that Ireland must protect itself from refugees,” said O’Connor.In a later post, now deleted by McGregor, the fighter reacted to footage of a bus of asylum seekers, writing: “People of the community are not told who these men are. Or why they are here. This is what I mean when I say we are at war. You cannot expect the people of Ireland to tolerate this. We will not.”In a separate, now deleted post on X, the UFC star said: “Do not let any Irish property be took over unannounced. Evaporate said property. It’s a war.”Since November 2018 , there have been a number of instances when properties or locations linked, to the housing of people seeking asylum or international protection were set on fire, according to analysis by Irish media.The UFC star, in a now deleted post, said: “I stand with the people of the East Wall,” in reference to protests which started in Dublin’s East Wall district in November 2022 over plans to house refugees in a disused office block. McGregor’s tweet was then circulated widely in Telegram channels with links to the far-right.Ireland, a country of just over five million people, saw 141,600 immigrants arrive on its shores in the year leading up to April 2023 – the highest figure in 16 years with some attracted by its strong economic performance (9.4% real GDP growth in 2022), according to the Central Statistics Office Ireland (CSO).In 2020, Ireland was ranked in the Migration Policy Index’s top 10 of countries for having “a comprehensive approach to integration, which fully guarantees equal rights, opportunities and security for immigrants and citizens.”But for many ordinary workers, the benefits are failing to reach their pockets and they struggle are struggling to afford high housing prices and rents.This leaves many without a stake in society, or a home to live in, and so Ireland is often seen as a nation of exiles, with more than 64,000 people leaving its shores to try their hand at a life elsewhere over the same time period.Matthew Donoghue, a professor in social policy at University College Dublin, told CNN socio-economic inequality can create a “sense of insecurity that the far-right have become adept at exploiting for their own gain, scapegoating people and groups who are facing exactly the same pressures.”“The pressures people feel can be a result of complex political, economic and social factors but instead the far-right offer a simple - but incorrect - narrative of blame,” he added.In November, McGregor shared, before unsharing, an X post by anti-immigration Irish influencer Mick O’Keefe about residents in rural Ireland putting up a checkpoint to deter asylum seekers from entering local areas.O’Keefe regularly writes to McGregor on X, calling him “President McGregor.” O’Keefe did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.AI-generated images of McGregor have also circulated online, showing him bare-chested, holding a rifle and leading a mob of armed Irishmen.In one video posted on X, Keith Woods, an Irish anti-immigration influencer, lambasts Ireland’s new hate speech laws, claiming they are a way to silence people speaking out against immigration.The same video then shows an AI-generated image of McGregor wearing a crown on his head, wrapped in an Irish tricolor.Woods has appeared on far-right agitator Nick Fuentes’ “America First” show. During a separate show, Fuentes – an American White nationalist and Holocaust denier – said that McGregor should “rise up” and “salvage [Ireland] because it’s going to be either the Irish or it’s going to be the Blacks,” before adding: “Only one side is going to come out of this thing alive.”McGregor, who follows Woods on X, has liked his posts in the past, including one where Woods quoted Irish 1916 patriot Padraig Pearse saying, “Ireland belongs to the Irish.”The phrase has become the new slogan of the far-right Irish National Party, for which Woods has been seen canvassing and holding the party’s banner.Woods did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.As recently as 2019, Foreign Policy said that Ireland was one of Europe’s “last countries without extreme nationalists in parliament.”But the Dublin riots and subsequent protests have cast the spotlight on the emergence of a new right-wing strain of politics and its amplification on social media.Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, told CNN that “far-right groups in Ireland are harnessing Twitter (now known as X) to spread their messages in the same way far-right groups do so in other parts of the EU.”But she added: “It is true that Ireland’s far right is less developed than in places like Germany and France, where there are rising political parties of this persuasion, or in Italy, Sweden, and other countries where the far right is part of the governing majority.”Donoghue added, “there is a larger (yet small) base of committed activists using social media, especially that they are able to organize more effectively than before. However, it is very important to note that they are roundly rejected by the vast majority of the Irish population.”"

        "title": "Neeraj Chopra has gained unlikely stardom in India. If he wins another Olympic gold, he will be ‘treated like God’",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "In a line-up of India’s sporting heroes, most of whom have gained celebrity status through cricket, Neeraj Chopra is an anomaly.In fact, the champion javelin thrower has barely bowled a ball or swung a bat since his childhood, even though he can’t help but notice the similarities between his discipline and his country’s favorite past-time.“I feel that in India, it’s natural, a fast arm,” Chopra tells CNN Sport. “And it’s a basic thing in javelin throwing – if you have a fast arm, you can throw far.”The South Asian country is home to more than 125 million cricket fans, according to a 2022 report by Ormax Media, but Chopra’s ability to hurl a javelin close to 300 feet has earned him a sizeable following in his own right.His stardom has only grown with each passing success. After winning Olympic gold in Tokyo three years ago – the first Asian athlete to do so in the javelin – Chopra was crowned world champion in Budapest last year, becoming the first Indian to win a world title in a track and field event of any kind.It perhaps comes as no surprise, given his historic career to date, that the understated 26-year-old has proven a hit back home.“So many people from my country, they support me, they watch my competitions,” says Chopra. “Even if I’m competing in the Diamond League, they stay awake until one or two at night and they watch my competition. It’s really amazing that people support athletics.”Such is his popularity that August 7 is now celebrated as National Javelin Day in India, the anniversary of Chopra winning his Olympic gold medal in Tokyo.Prior to Chopra, India had practically no history in track and field, winning most of its Olympic medals in field hockey and wrestling.But now there is genuine excitement each time the superstar athlete competes, and as he jockeys up a runway with a quivering javelin in hand, a nation holds its breath.“You ask anybody in India who their favorite sportsperson is at the moment, unanimously the answer will be Neeraj Chopra – despite the fact that athletics is not a popular sport,” veteran journalist Norris Pritam, who last year published a book on Chopra’s life and career, tells CNN Sport.“On the other hand, cricket is a popular sport, a common man’s sport. People talk, breathe, eat cricket, it’s kind of a religion. But still, Neeraj Chopra is the best sportsperson. He’s a hero. He’s absolutely a hero in India.”Growing up in the rural village of Khandra in the northern state of Haryana, Chopra played cricket and volleyball – another sport in which a fast arm can be a useful weapon – in his pre-teen years.He was overweight as a child – carrying what he has recently described as “excess flab” – and was frequently told that sport wasn’t for him. But that all changed as soon as he caught sight of a javelin shimmering through the sky at an athletics stadium in the nearby city of Panipat.“It was a very random thing for me because there was no background in my family or my whole village – nobody was an athlete, nobody knows about javelin throwing,” says Chopra.“When I go to the stadium … I really like how the javelin flies and how it’s going like fish swimming in the sea. I really like this thing, and even now when I throw, I always enjoy how the javelin flies.”This was in 2011, and it was enough for the then-13-year-old Chopra to be inspired to try the sport for himself.His father and uncles, part of a family of farmers, pooled together enough money to buy a steel javelin, and it was in a plowing field near the family home that Chopra attempted some of his first throws.A seed was soon sown, and the fledgling athlete would spend hour after hour launching throw after throw.“He started without any training, without any family background, without any sort of formal school where there could be a javelin thrower,” says Pritam. “In fact, the school in the village had no culture for sport, no grounds for sport.”Before he had any proper coaching, Chopra relied on YouTube videos to hone his technique. His talent soon became evident, and after moving to a sports academy in the city of Panchkula, his arm speed got faster, his throws further, and international competitions quickly followed.Today, Chopra’s resumé is long and impressive, boasting two Asian Games titles and a Commonwealth Games gold medal on top of his world and Olympic triumphs.He is the favorite to defend his title at the Paris Olympics, which get underway on July 26, though he’s not allowing thoughts of further success to enter his head at this stage.“My main focus is to stay healthy,” says Chopra, “but I’m not taking the pressure of winning a gold medal again. I’ll just do my training with 100% of my heart and I’ll give my best … That day will decide who will win a medal.”Performing under pressure, particularly with such a huge fanbase back home in India, has been a common theme of Chopra’s career. His popularity doesn’t faze him, instead feeding his self-belief right down to his final throw.“This is not pressure for me,” he adds. “I feel really good when people are talking about me and they say, ‘Okay, Neeraj can win this medal, Neeraj can throw far.’ I always take these things positively.”Having won his first world title – previously, the most obvious gap in his trophy cabinet – last year, Chopra now wants to throw beyond 90 meters (about 295 feet), which he describes as a “magical mark” in javelin throwing.Only 24 men in history have ever thrown further than 90 meters, but Chopra’s personal best is only six centimeters (about 2.4 inches) shy of that distance; it is more a matter of when, rather than if, he can tick off that goal.In India, however, he has nothing more to prove, his status as a national hero already secured.“Everybody knows Neeraj,” says Pritam, “because his posters are there, his billboards are there, he’s in books and magazines and everything.“You put on the TV and you find Neeraj there talking; he’s a brand ambassador to hundreds of things – sanitation, education, selling products on television. He is a moving billboard, one can say now.”And if he wins a second gold medal at the Olympics? “He will be treated like God,” adds Pritam.Chopra, rarely overwhelmed by such adulation, is taking public recognition in his stride. He nearly always trains and competes outside of India, but when he is back home, he is often struck by his far-reaching influence.“When people meet me, they always say, ‘Our son or our daughter will also start javelin or athletics, and they can also win a medal for India,’” says Chopra. “This is a good thing for me.”"

        "title": "Meet the Black women pushing for equality in swimming",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.“There’s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you’ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,” the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation – a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is “the only sport that can save your life.”The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.“I used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,” she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.“There’s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,” Dale adds.She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London.It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people – and leaving many more without homes.“There’s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons … who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,” Dale says.“Many people say it’s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they’ve taken time for themselves.”While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England’s report, published in January 2020.Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found.This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have “low” or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country’s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a “Whites Only” rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England – England’s national swimming governing body – and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.“Most drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,” says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family – a 53-year-old father and his two children – died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.“This was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,” Obe says. “(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, ‘We’ve been talking about doing something for our community. We’ve got to do something. We’ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.’”“It’s no longer just about that lack of representation,” Obe adds.“It’s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.”However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.“At the moment, we don’t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn’t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.”Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, “implores” people to learn to swim.“I have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who’s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,” she tells CNN Sport.“I take the two of them just as they are – kind of like separate things. I’m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.”At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people – especially Black girls – who wanted to break into the sport.But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.“Fortunately, for myself, I haven’t come across any barriers at the level I’m at currently,” Dearing says.“But I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don’t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we’re better suited to other sports and so shouldn’t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.”CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.FINA – the global governing body for swimming – told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its “Swimming for All, Swimming for Life” program.“FINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,” the organization said to CNN in a statement. “FINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally.“Work will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,” FINA added.Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is “committed to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.”“Barriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups – like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,” the statement added.Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than £550 million ($670 million), which they’ve selected “due to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.”“It’s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,” Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.“Our goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they’re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,” he added.Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.From representing their organization at the UK’s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney – one of the most deprived boroughs in London – Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.“That community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,” says Obe.“Only in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.”In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.Speaking about the program, Obe says: “It’s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we’re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don’t engage in aquatics, why we don’t see the representation pool side and why we don’t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.”Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she’s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.“I really think if anything is going to change, it’s going to be now, it’s going to be over the next couple of years,” she says. “Each story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there’s nothing wrong with that, that’s just another challenge that we have to face and we’re up for it.“It’s tough – it’s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.“I like to feel that I’m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.“It’s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it’s really frightening and daunting, but if I’m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.”"

        "title": "He was running the biggest soccer club in Ukraine. After war broke out, his life changed forever",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "The noise of fighter jets zipping overhead is a sound that Serhii Palkin finds difficult to forget – even two years on.Like every Ukrainian, the 49-year-old lived through the “nightmare” that unfolded as Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.While he scrambled to keep his young family safe amid the near constant bombardment, Palkin also had the responsibility of looking after Ukraine’s most successful soccer club, Shakhtar Donetsk.You would never guess Palkin is living through a war when you first meet him. He’s calm, measured and quick to quip a joke as he sits down in an unassuming meeting room in London to reflect on how his personal and professional life has changed forever.“We are all suffering from everything that’s going on. Two years is a huge term to stay in these kinds of conditions … a very big impact on your psychological stability, on your moral aspects,” the softly spoken Palkin tells CNN Sport.“Mentally, it’s difficult to survive, day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month. Almost two years we have been in these kinds of conditions.”Palkin was named Shakhtar Donetsk’s CEO in 2004, taking charge of the most decorated club in Ukraine. In addition to its domestic dominance, the team regularly competes in the UEFA Champions League, alongside the biggest names of the sport.While previously occupied with the daily running of the business, the former accountant now confronts issues of life and death on a daily basis.Soccer, all of a sudden, wasn’t important. People’s lives became the biggest priority.While his own family sought refuge abroad in the early stages of the invasion, Palkin hunkered down in the besieged city of Kyiv and didn’t leave until every one of his players were safely out of harm’s way.Since the conflict began, though, six people with direct ties to the club have died, according to Palkin.“My life completely changed and I started to be involved in crisis management. This is the most important thing I dealt with and deal with now,” he says, explaining the new demands on his role.“Because of the war, we have this crisis everywhere.”By the end of 2022, soccer returned to Ukraine as the country’s Premier League resumed – albeit without fans.While some matches were paused because of air-raid sirens, and despite the obvious risks of staging a competitive sporting event during the invasion, soccer was deemed an important part of the war effort.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said as much, allowing players to travel around Europe in order to represent the country on the global stage.Soccer was now a symbol of hope amid the misery of conflict.Palkin says everything the club did, and still does, is in order to help win the war – whether that be raising money by playing charity matches or providing some good news to the soccer-mad population of Ukraine.“If they allowed us to leave the country in wartime, it means that we need to give huge feedback for people living in Ukraine,” he says, referring to how the club travels to play exhibitions around the world and its home games in Germany.“It means that, yes, you can lose, but you should play from the heart and you should show the best football you can, attacking football, you know, beautiful football, like our DNA.”Shakhtar has certainly done that at times – most recently beating FC Barcelona 1-0 in the Champions League group stage in November.It was a result made all the more impressive given the logistics involved with the club playing games in wartime.In truth, Shakhtar has been an itinerant club since 2014 when it was forced out of its home in the Donbas region amid Russia’s forceful annexation of Crimea. But even this club was tested after the full-scale invasion.With flying in and out of Ukraine impossible, the team often spends days traveling on buses in order to reach their location for matches. Palkin looks exhausted as he reels off the long-list of practicalities that need to be addressed, including ordering food for the team and ensuring they are always as safe as possible.Palkin admits the team is often not on a level playing field when it plays in European competitions. How can a player, for example, be expected to compete at the highest level when he’s just spent two days sitting on a bus?“For us to continue to play football and to concentrate 100% on the game is very difficult because you’re always thinking about what’s going on at home, with your parents, with your family,” he says.“If you look at the life of our players, it’s not normal. Everything that we are doing today in our football life in Ukraine, it’s not normal.“From a physical point of view and from a mental point of view, it’s very difficult to live [let alone] show good, attractive football […] our players have shown themselves like real heroes.”The soccer world has largely stood by Ukraine, showing public signs of support and raising millions of dollars for the relief effort.However, Palkin is critical of world soccer’s governing body, FIFA, who he says has forgotten his club.The root of his criticism lies in FIFA’s decision to adopt a ruling which allowed international players and coaches to suspend their contracts with Ukrainian and Russian clubs.Shakhtar’s strategy has long been focused on bringing young players, notably from Brazil, to the club, developing them and then selling them on for a profit.Former Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho is the perfect example, moving to Ukraine from Brazilian club Atlético Paranaense in 2005 before joining the Premier League giant for around $40 million in 2013.But many of those players, which the club had invested in before the war, left Shakhtar for free as a result of the ruling.Palkin said he was happy to facilitate players leaving the club, but argued the ruling allowed some clubs to take advantage – signing Shakhtar players for nothing, before recouping a profit after moving them on.Palkin says the club was left with debts of over $43 million.Shakhtar was part of a group that appealed FIFA’s decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) but the case was dismissed in January 2023.The club then filed a complaint with the EU’s European Commission last year, as Palkin continues to fight for “justice.” The European Commission told CNN it was “currently assessing” the complaint “based on our standard procedures.”“We are one football family and, if one member of the family has a problem, everybody should support,” says Palkin, praising English Premier League club Chelsea for its conduct when signing young star Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar in 2023, for an initial $75 million.“You see a lot of positive words of support, but in some cases, when you need the support, there is no support.“The situation with FIFA, for me, it’s very strange and not understandable at all.”FIFA referred CNN to the CAS decision when asked for comment.While the war means Palkin is unable to plan for more than a month in advance, his focus is on building the squad back to its former glory.He admitted that signing players amid the uncertainty is difficult, but not impossible. Even when players are keen, he said, it’s another question when it comes to convincing parents and family members to let their child go.“I don’t have any case when we couldn’t sign because of the war. There can be different issues, but the war is not a major one,” he says.Despite all the challenges, the Shakhtar CEO is confident his club can come out of this impossible time in a strong position.Not least because Shakhtar is a team playing for more than just points. Palkin has witnessed how the sport he loves can offer temporary reprieve from the darkest of times and how the money raised from charity matches can have a tangible impact on supporting those trying to rebuild their lives.“Football has unbelievable world level influence,” he says, a smile breaking out on his face.“Believe me, this influence can change anybody and we live through this and we understand this because we feel it and we see the reactions.“It’s above everything, you know? And if we all stay together and go in one way, I can tell you 100% we can positively change any area of humanity.”Shakhtar Donetsk failed to qualify for the knockout rounds of the Champions League this year but dropped into this season’s Europa League, Europe’s secondary club competition, instead.It faces French side Marseille on Thursday in first leg of the play-off match. The game will once again take place in Hamburg, Germany."

        "text": "FIFA President Gianni Infantino has condemned the violence that broke out after Trabzonspor fans stormed the pitch and attacked Fenerbahçe players following a Turkey Süper Lig match Sunday.The brawl broke out after the final whistle as Fenerbahçe celebrated its 3-2 win.Security forces tried to shield Fenerbahçe players, as fans stormed the pitch.“The violence witnessed after the Turkish Süper Lig match between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe is absolutely unacceptable – on or off the field, it has no place in our sport or society,” Infantino said in a statement released on social media.“I have said it before, and I will say it again – without exception, in football, all players have to be safe and secure to play the game which brings such joy to so many people all over the world.“I call on the relevant authorities to ensure that this is respected at all levels and for the perpetrators of the shocking events in Trabzon to be held accountable for their actions,” Infantino added.Following the match Turkey’s interior minister Ali Yerlikaya confirmed in a post on X, that authorities had launched an investigation into the brawl and to identify the fans who had stormed the pitch.In a statement released on Sunday, the Turkey Football Federation said, “We are in communication with our representatives and state officials regarding the events that occurred during and after the match played between Trabzonspor A.Ş. and Fenerbahçe A.Ş. in the Trendyol Super League.“What happened in football, which is a game of friendship, peace and brotherhood, is never acceptable.“No one should have any doubt that once the investigations are completed, necessary criminal sanctions will be imposed on those responsible for these incidents to prevent them from recurring,” the federation added.CNN has reached out to Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe for comment.Following the match, according to BBC Sport, Trabzonspor coach Abdullah Avci said, “We are going through a period that Turkish football is now completely fed by chaos, where tensions are constantly high, and where we cannot use the healing power of football.”While Fenerbahçe manager Ismail Kartal reportedly added, “I don’t understand why this place is so tense. Don’t we have the right to celebrate? We need to overcome these things. We need to be tolerant towards each other and have common sense.”This is the latest controversy to engulf Turkish football.In December, Faruk Koca, the president of top-flight Turkish soccer club Ankaragücü resigned, a day after he punched a FIFA-licensed referee in the face. Recently, there have been reports of several protests of referee-related decisions."

        "text": "As he led the team out inside of a raucous Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night, Arsenal captain Martin Ødegaard had the weight of expectation on his shoulders.The Gunners needed a turn over a goal deficit from the first-leg against Porto to secure safe passage into the quarterfinals of the Champions League for the first time in 14 years – in a tournament Arsenal has never managed to win.But amid all the spine-tingling, goosebump-inducing noise swirling around the ground, the Norwegian looked like the calmest man in the stadium.It’s fitting, perhaps, that the first thing Ødegaard would have seen when he walked out of the tunnel before kick-off was a huge sign unfurled on the opposing stand which read ‘Our House’ in Spanish.Because Ødegaard looks to have finally found his home at Arsenal.Despite the pressure, the midfielder was laughing and joking with the children lining up in front of the players before kick-off, doing his best to reassure them amid the boisterous atmosphere created by the fans desperate to see their side progress in Europe’s premier competition.His composure was a sign of things to come. On a magical night for Arsenal fans, Ødegaard produced another sensational performance, proving once again to be the creative spark for Mikel Arteta’s team.His delicately weighted pass in the final moments of the first-half sliced open Porto’s defense and gave Leandro Trossard the perfect opportunity to level the scores on aggregate.Thereafter it was Ødegaard driving the team forward. His relentless running set the standard for his teammates to follow and his vision on the ball proved to be a constant threat to the resilience of Porto’s defense.Even when the hosts looked to be tiring, there was Ødegaard orchestrating the crowd, pleading for more support for his team.Unsurprisingly, the Arsenal captain was first to step up in the nerve-shredding penalty shootout, dispatching his effort without a fuss, then celebrating by pumping his chest and slapping the badge on his shirt.It was a celebration he was able to repeat moments later after Porto missed two of their efforts, with the Norwegian leading his team on a victory lap around a bouncing Emirates Stadium.Since being made captain in 2022, the playmaker has become used to carrying the hopes of Arsenal. Along with the likes of local star Bukayo Saka, the Norwegian international is helping to usher in a new era for the club after it struggled to deal with former manager Arsene Wenger’s departure.He might only be 25 years old, but Ødegaard has been making history on a football pitch for over a decade.The naturally-gifted midfielder was only 15 when he started attracting global attention after becoming the youngest player to feature for both his club Strømsgodset and the Norwegian national team.His performances caught the eye of some the biggest clubs in Europe, with the likes of Manchester United and Liverpool among those expressing interest in signing the precocious young talent.“In the beginning, it was unreal and a little bit surreal that all these clubs wanted Martin, but it’s strange what you can get used to,” his father Hans Erik Ødegaard told CNN Sport back in 2014. “Almost every top European club has been in touch.”Speak to soccer fans now and they’ll likely remember hearing about a young Norwegian teenager who was widely touted as the next world star and who, in 2015, eventually signed a high-profile deal with Real Madrid.His move to La Liga was supposed to be the first step in his journey to greatness, with the then 16-year-old moving to the Spanish capital to learn from the best, namely former France midfielder Zinedine Zidane who was the coach of Madrid’s reserve team at the time.Heralded as the future king of Los Blancos, Ødegaard became the club’s youngest player when he made his debut in 2016, but it wasn’t to be.Stuck in a bottleneck behind Real legends like Luka Modrić, Toni Kroos and Casemiro, Ødegaard’s opportunities in the first-team were severely limited.So in search of regular playing time, the teenager spent two loan spells in the Dutch league before a season at Spanish side Real Sociedad. He continued to show glimpses of his talent but struggled for consistency.Then came a loan move to Arsenal in 2021.This time, it felt like a perfect fit. Looking to usher in a new era at the north London club, manager Arteta signed Ødegaard on a permanent deal, in a move that finally gave the playmaker stability.In many ways it felt like Ødegaard’s last chance to make it at the top of the game, and he has taken taken it with both hands.North London has since become a place where he has finally recognized his potential, leading Arsenal’s recent resurgence and producing world-class performances.“At a very early age, he had huge expectations,” Arsenal manager Arteta said of Ødegaard when he signed a contract extension in 2023.“Martin is the player that he is today at that age because of what he has been through in the last four or five years. That’s what is making the player and the person he is today. We are really happy that he’s found home.”As well as being Arteta’s go-to man, the Norwegian has also become a firm fan favorite – with countless Gooners proudly wearing replica shirts with his name on the back.“The spirit here around the whole club is just unbelievable. It’s the best I’ve ever seen in my life as part of a team,” Ødegaard said in his pre-match program article – something the Arsenal captain pens before every home game – ahead of the Porto tie.“We have something special for sure, and that’s showing on the pitch too, how much we enjoy playing together.”However if he’s to match the level set by some of his predecessors at Arsenal, the current captain will need to lift more than one major trophy during his time at the club.Many fans still hope it’ll happen this season, with the Gunners facing a quarterfinal tie in the Champions League and a tight title race with English Premier League rivals Manchester City and Liverpool.There are still doubts, of course, whether this young Arsenal side has what it takes to get over the line in either competition. Few of the players have ever won a major trophy and the manager is still relatively new to the big stage.But, in Ødegaard, Arsenal finally has a leader who looks determined to lead this team to success. And, in Arsenal, Ødegaard finally has a place to shine."

        "title": "This soccer star has been handed a six-year prison sentence in absentia for trafficking cocaine. He’s still playing",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "He’s seemingly led an extraordinary double life. Quincy Promes is a successful soccer star, playing as forward with major European clubs Ajax and Sevilla and now Spartak Moscow, as well as representing the Netherlands at the international level.Promes played 50 times for the Netherlands and, according to the respected website Transfermarkt, at one point in his career had a transfer value of $26 million.Away from the pitch, Promes has recently been convicted for drug trafficking by an Amsterdam court. His conviction comes against the backdrop of the Netherlands’ wider war on drugs.Earlier this month, Dutch prosecutors successfully argued that Promes was central to a drug trafficking operation involved in smuggling some 1,360 kilograms of cocaine from Brazil to the Netherlands through the port of Antwerp in Belgium in 2020, in two separate incidents.“It is particularly bad that the suspect [Promes] normalizes and almost romanticizes the large-scale cocaine trade,” said Dutch prosecutors.“The suspect profiles himself that way to the outside world, while he is an example for young people who look up to him,” the prosecutors added.Promes was convicted in absentia to six years in prison for drug trafficking. It’s a sentence he won’t serve any time soon given given he lives in Russia, playing for Russian Premier League side Spartak Moscow.“The suspect maintained a managerial role and was a financier. He worked calculatedly, was careful and did not take too many risks. He did not get his own hands dirty. He let others do the dirty work,” said prosecutors earlier this month in the case.Lawyers for Promes said he denied the charges, and would be appealing the sentence.“We will further explain our grievances to the Court of Appeal during a yet to be scheduled public hearing,” said Promes’ lawyers in a statement.“Finally, we would like to emphasize that as long as the judge’s verdict is not final, every suspect in the Netherlands must be presumed innocent. This also applies to Mr. Promes.”Last year, Promes was convicted in absentia for stabbing his cousin in the knee, Reuters reported, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison, according to prosecutors.Promes’ contract with Spartak Moscow runs until the end of June 2024, according to Transfermarkt. The Russian club did not respond to CNN’s request for comment as to whether it will continue to play Promes in matches or extend his contract.Criminologist Hans Nelen told CNN that Promes’ case is “remarkable … From the outside, many people are inclined to say: ‘He will earn millions of euros a year…. Why [is he] involved in the drug trade to begin with?’”A professor of criminology at Maastricht University, Nelen says the general public’s reaction to Promes’ situation was one of frustration.“That he’s out and he cannot be arrested and then he cannot be put in jail, and is still playing football,” he said.According to Nelen, Promes posting photos on social media in expensive cars, wearing diamond encrusted jewelry and on luxury holidays to destinations like Dubai, isn’t a great look with the Dutch public.“He’s still putting posts on social media, and he’s pretending that he is untouchable,” added Nelen.CNN has contacted representatives for Promes, offering the soccer player the opportunity to comment on his recent court case, but hadn’t received a reply at the time of publication.Earlier this year, Femke Halsema, the mayor of Amsterdam, warned that Rotterdam – Europe’s largest port – has become a “global transit hub for cocaine,” with more than 22,000 kg of the drug seized in the first half of 2022 compared with 29,702 kg in the first half of 2023 in spite of authorities’ efforts to take on trafficking. Dutch Customs seized almost 60,000 kg of cocaine in 2023, the Dutch government reported.Halsema, along with the mayor of Rotterdam, said that more must be done to address drug crime, warning in a 2022 letter to the House of Representatives of “a criminal culture of violence” gripping the country.The country’s Multidisciplinary Intervention Team was rebranded that same year as the National Alliance against Subversive Crime (NASC), with its mission “to expose and untangle the financial and other interconnectedness of the underworld and mainstream society,” according to the Dutch government.Concern over drug-related crime in the Netherlands has risen in recent years. In 2021, Dutch crime journalist Peter R. de Vries, known for his investigative work exposing the criminal underworld, was gunned down on a busy central Amsterdam street.“We cannot deny that the drug trade and drug trafficking in general has become a huge issue during the last decade,” said Nelen, though the criminologist adds that “when you think about employment between the drug economy and the legitimate economy, corruption and political influences, I would say that’s rather limited.”“It’s not such a case like Mexico or Columbia or to a certain extent Italy, that somehow our legitimate economy or political system has been completely infiltrated by criminals,” he explained.Still, the Netherlands is a key destination for drug traffickers because it is home to several large ports and borders Germany and Belgium, so it’s a “gateway to Europe,” according to Nelen.Though Promes’ conviction is certainly one of the highest-profile cases in the country in recent years, Nelen said that the Netherlands has seen other attention-grabbing cases of celebrities’ involvement in the illegal drugs trade, including martial arts professionals and kickboxers.Dutchman David Endt, who has worked as a journalist and with Dutch clubs in organizational roles and is now a soccer agent, told CNN that he knew a very different Promes in the early stages of his soccer career.“There was a very pleasant guy there, always – big laugh on his face, did nobody really any harm, and suddenly [he] came into a spiral and then it goes down and down,” said Endt, adding that he hasn’t had contact with Promes for more than 10 years.“The problem with being instantly famous … It’s hard to make the right choices with so-called friends, you attract a lot of people who have bad intentions,” added Endt.And Dutch soccer clubs seem to be taking notice.“Some football clubs are now aware of this and using retired police officers or other coaches to talk to kids who are already 14, 15, 16 years old, who are very talented, to warn them of some of the dangers and some of the risks that may come across. So there are indeed preventative measures taken by some of the clubs,” Nelen adds.Endt, who worked with Ajax in an organizational role for 20 years, told CNN: “After some incidents, smaller ones, bigger ones, we got help from police officers, who sometimes came to the club and they explained the problems young players, or maybe also older players can meet, especially in this social media world.”CNN has reached out to Ajax for further comment.The youth development system for soccer players in the Netherlands is impressive, according to Endt.“There’s also always attention to be aware of your responsibilities not only to yourself, or your teammates, but also in view of the world around you, that you have to behave well, that a good player is also an example in life. But not everybody is following this, obviously.”"

        "title": "Saudi Arabia is trying to disrupt soccer’s world order. The reasons why might surprise you",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbappé – including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year – it was slammed by critics as sportswashing.Mbappé might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (€90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports.In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe’s major leagues – France’s Ligue 1, Spain’s La Liga, Italy’s Serie A, Germany’s Bundesliga and the English Premier League – according to Deloitte.Despite the Arab nation’s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia’s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn’t “care” about the country’s investment in sport being described as sportswashing.“Well if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,” MBS said in an interview with Fox News which aired Wednesday.Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: “I don’t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we’re going to get that one and a half percent.”Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation’s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport.By attracting some of the world’s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants “to drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,” though it’s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop “young Saudi talent.”During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt.Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D’Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid.As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (€835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (€353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year.The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world’s highest paid soccer player.As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees – all international stars – play for one of the PIF-owned clubs.Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was “not in [the SPL’s] competitive advantage” to report the salaries offered to players and coaches.The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players.Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (£700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (£12 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq.In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers “just aren’t true.”“Essentially, the signal is ‘We mean business,’” Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.“We’ve got so much money that for a player who is … coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he’s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,” Chadwick said, describing Saudi’s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost.Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries – including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses.It remains to be seen whether Saudi’s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort.The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country’s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi’s victory over Argentina during last year’s men’s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win.Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. “For example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you’re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,” Chadwick said.Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of “The Price of Football” podcast.“From the Saudi authorities’ point of view, they’re getting a ready-made product. Everybody’s heard of Benzema. Everybody’s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,” Maguire said.Saudi Arabia’s lofty sporting ambitions don’t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup.Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men’s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt – although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy.Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between €35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year.Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country’s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals – and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30. Of this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport.Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia’s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring – and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated.Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, “what is just as significant is the security of the royal family,” Chadwick adds.The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region.Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria.“What we’re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,” Chadwick said.“You want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it … But don’t question us,” Chadwick explained.Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer “can be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.”At the same time, there has been “a significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country” this year, Chadwick told CNN.Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years.In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed.“Reputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and … Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,” James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, “The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,” explains.Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices.Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick – not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital.“Part of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that’s a way of attracting interest to the country,” said Maguire.CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of “sportswashing” its image.In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia’s purported “sportswashing,” the kingdom’s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: “People that don’t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they’ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi.“See what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,” he added.Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, “they feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.”In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport’s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up “owning golf.”Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men’s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport’s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control.“They have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,” he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours.When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football’s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose.“As far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don’t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don’t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,” he said last month.“When people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they’re playing.”Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: “I don’t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore.“I don’t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can’t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?” he added.Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is “no different from what the Premier League have done.”“There was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we’re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,” said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN.New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league’s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars.“We can’t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.” But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which “simply doesn’t exist in Saudi Arabia,” Chadwick explained to CNN.European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams’ spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs.Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy – up from its current value of “0.000 something.”“They’ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,” Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world’s domestic leagues.“That is feasible given the amount of money that they’re spending.”“I think they’re realistic. They don’t say that they’re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,” Maguire said.When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world’s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund.CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency.Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA’s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA’s systems of governance.The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia’s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour’s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf.Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league’s financial endeavors, “nobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.”“This vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,” Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is “signaling.”“It is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.”"

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "As a golf fan watching at a tournament, you have the privilege of being up close to all the action.Lining the course, spectators can almost reach out and touch their favorite players as they go about their business of driving, chipping and putting.That proximity also means that they are offered very little protection from potentially wayward shots – as one onlooker at The Players Championship on Saturday almost found out to their cost as they watched US golfer Max Homa at TPC Sawgrass.Homa had been enjoying a promising start to the tournament and was one-under par after the 13th hole in his third round and in touching distance of the leaders.Then things turned sour on the 14th hole for the 33-year-old American golfer.First, his drive found the water down the left before his next shot was shanked into the trees.With the 33-year-old’s progress towards the hole impeded by foliage, Homa was forced to attempt a relief shot back onto the fairway.When any player strays into the rough, fans tend to congregate and get an even closer look at a golfer’s ball-striking abilities.Homa warned those fans to take a step back so they would be out of harms way of the flight of his ball. However, when he did eventually attempt his third shot, Homa’s ball came within inches of hitting a fan, who was filming the golfer.In a video posted on TikTok taken from in front of Homa with the caption “who said golf was boring,” the ball is seen flying towards the camera at extreme speed, coming dangerously close to whoever is filming before a loud crack can be heard.In a separate video taken from behind Homa, the ball is shown whizzing over a spectator’s head before smashing against a tree just behind them.The close call seemed to delight watching fans, with some breaking out into laughter when they realized nobody had been hit.Homa eventually struggled to a quadruple-bogey nine on the par-four 14th hole, ruling him out of contention for the tournament.After his third round on Saturday, Homa explained that he had asked fans to move back, adding that the whole incident was “scary.”“I was trying to go much higher than that. Yesterday I should have probably asked them to move more but I didn’t think I was gonna knife it,” he told reporters.“But typically you ask them to move and it’s like two steps back – [they’re] kind of throwing caution to the wind at times with their own safety,” added Homa. “But I did not hit anybody … it was unfortunately freaky but I gave some people a good story. I heard a lot of people laughing so I got that out of it.”Homa also provided an update on social media afterwards.“FYI I did not hit anyone in the head on 14 yesterday. It smoked a tree,” Homa wrote on X – formerly known as Twitter. “Really thankful it missed the guy. That would have been devastating. Cool video tho if I do say so myself.”It might not fit into typical golfing attire but maybe fans should pack hard hats when they attend live events."

On Thursday, the water took its long-awaited revenge by claiming two of his balls – and even a club.Across more than four decades, hundreds of the PGA Tour’s finest players have watched in horror as their tee shot splashed into the lake at TPC Sawgrass’ iconic par-three 17th hole.Yet on all of his 28 previous visits to the penultimate tee at the ‘fifth major’, Canada’s Hadwin had safely found the island green.The 36-year-old had arrived at the fabled hole with momentum too, thanks to a birdie at the 16th, only for his subsequent under-hit tee shot to plop into the lake short of the green.The end to his flawless run was compounded when Hadwin’s 14-foot putt agonizingly trickled an inch wide of the cup, leaving the exasperated world No. 46 to tap in for a double-bogey.Frustration would turn to fury mere moments later, when Hadwin – having narrowly avoided sending his tee shot into the water running along the left of the fairway – saw his subsequent approach take an awkward bounce before speeding over the 18th green and into the drink.His ball quickly found itself in a race to the bottom of the lake with his club, as an incensed Hadwin sent his 8-iron careening into the water with an emphatic throw. The technique was not lost on his wife Jessica.After initially missing “a little moment on 18 where the club joined its bestie the ball”, she posted on X: “If I’m going simply on the aesthetic of the toss … 10/10.”Hadwin holed out for bogey to sign off with a three-over 75 overall, leaving him 10 shots adrift of day one leaders Wyndham Clark, Xander Schauffele, and Rory McIlroy – the latter of whom also endured some aquatic anguish during the first round.Yet the Canadian, chasing his second win on the PGA Tour, looked to have cooled off by the evening, thanks in no small part to some therapeutic cookie decorating with his young daughter Maddox.“It won’t bring back the club, but it will help ease the pain of all the water balls,” Jessica added in a shared photo of the duo.Club makers Callaway sent out a replacement 8-iron to reach Hadwin before his afternoon tee off Friday, according to Golf Digest.It’s not the first time Hadwin’s wife has poked fun at his misfortune. After the golfer was mistakenly leveled by a security guard while celebrating his friend Nick Taylor’s win at the Canadian Open last year, she joked that her husband was “still among the land of the living.”During Friday’s second round, American golfer Beau Hossler achieved the unwanted milestone of hitting the 1000th ball into the water at the 17th hole since ShotLink tracking began in 2003.Ten players had found the lake from the tee during the first round, though New Zealand’s Ryan Fox aced the hole, becoming the 14th golfer in Players history to do so."

        "title": "Explosive knockouts, unique fighting style and a love for dancing: meet the UFC’s newest debutant, Michael ‘Venom’ Page",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Michael Page stands motionless looking directly into a camera. Around him the room is an a frenzy, but he calmly spreads his arms wide while still locking eyes with the camera.He is eventually dragged away, but not before sticking his tongue out at the camera operator, letting out a guttural scream of celebration.The reason for the pose? Page has just burst onto the mixed martial arts (MMA) scene, performing an explosive tornado kick to win via technical knockout on his professional debut; the move drew parallels with Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) great Anderson Silva.The moment goes viral on social media and YouTube afterwards, vaulting Page into the consciousness of the wider MMA community despite it being his debut.Twelve years on, the fighter from London will make his UFC debut against Kevin Holland on March 9 at UFC 299.As one of MMA’s more polarizing figures due to his unique fighting style and the panache he brings to his bouts, the 36-year-old Page describes his fights as the “full package deal.”“If you come to see my fights, it’s not just what happens in the fight: it’s before the fight, the build-up, it’s the walk out to a fight and it’s the celebration after the fight, which I’m very much known for,” Page told CNN Sport.“But the fighting style, I’d say that comes from, it’s part of my personality. There’s a few elements. The Caribbean culture. I love to dance, love to smile, just loud, a bit more like outgoing.”Both of his parents practised Lau Gar kung fu before moving to freestyle kickboxing, while he also had aunts and uncles who competed, as did a lot of his siblings. He says his parents were his “main inspirations” for taking up fighting.“Even if I was to take you to my mom’s house now, there’s trophies there that are not mine, they’re hers,” says Page, adding that is family were “raised through the martial arts.”He has fond memories of the bus rides to and from competitions, creating songs and singing them with his family as they traveled to and from events.Page admits that he used to get his “ass kicked a lot” in those early stages of his career, but that the camaraderie, the stories, the friends he met along the way was a tonic to what happened in the ring.While some of his family members gave up competitive fighting as the years went by, Page stuck with it. He learned the ropes and made his first steps in kickboxing as he toughened up.Page then switched to mixed martial arts. Kickboxing’s limited earnings played a part in that decision, but so was his desire to keep learning new skills – something MMA offered.“You have to learn jujitsu, you have to learn wrestling, there’s so much extra things I’d have to learn. Even the style of kickboxing is different,” Page said.He initially was set on moving to Miami to train, but a last-minute visit to London Shootfighters changed his mind.London Shootfighters has earned a reputation for regularly producing top-level combat sports competitors, and Page could tell instantly that it was the place for him.“From being taught very well from a young age, I can hear sense. Even if I went to a football club, I can tell when a coach knows how to coach. When I got there, I could tell that the guys talking really know how to coach,” said Page of London Shootfighters and its reputation of regularly producing top-level competitors.“I fell in love with it. Fell in love with the coaches, their knowledge, how intense they were because I was really game to go and be the best.”With his background in kickboxing, Page’s MMA style of fighting has incorporated elements from other disciplines, all resulting in his unorthodox technique.Unlike many of his rivals, Page will fight with his arms down by his side, prioritizing keeping his distance and launching devasting strikes from afar.He says his unique style is akin to that of the Looney Tunes’ ‘Tasmanian Devil’ or the video game character ‘Crash Bandicoot.’“There’s a lot of crazy stuff that happens. It’s visually entertaining because it’s not the normal. I don’t just walk in a straight line. I have to do things extremely differently.”Page describes himself as a “showman.” He can be seen seemingly taunting his opponents mid-fight, rolling his shoulders similar to a dance move and fighting with a broad smile on his face. Page has watched some of his dad’s old fights and he recognizes that showman streak in his father as well.That “showman” element acknowledges to his upbringing on the road as well as his Caribbean culture.Such is his dedication to his ostentatious persona, Page used to study Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson and how he delivered his lines during his WWE heyday while also writing down lines to save for later, all in order to build his brand.Page’s showmanship feeds into his MMA ‘Venom’ moniker, which is a nod to the force of his punch, despite his slight frame.His flying knee knockout of Evangelista Santos in 2016 only added to his nickname: Michael ‘Venom’ Page – or more simply, ‘MVP.’However, Page’s distinctive style isn’t for all in the fighting community. While some praise its flair, others have critiqued its effectiveness and longevity.Page has also received flak for his lackadaisical nature and flamboyant movements seemingly taunting and goading opponents.His flowing, almost rhythmical movements in the ring can often seem a jarring juxtaposition to his counterparts’ more surgical style.“When I’m expressing myself like that, I am at my most comfortable,” says Page. “Now having somebody throw punches and kicks and try and take off your head and choke you out and say that you’re comfortable in front of them is a difficult thing to achieve. So I have to do as many things as I can to relax myself.“Dancing, I love. Music – it’s almost like I could hear music in my head, but the crowd is my music. So all of those things just keep me nice and calm. And fighting in a high intensity situation, being calm allows you to see so much more than trying to match the energy of what’s going on around you.”The negative comments he’s received over the years – he describes the chatter after his debut fight as 98% negative – for his style have previously bothered him, but now he’s come to appreciate just having people talk about him.“The good thing about that: it means more people are talking about it because there’s a conversation to be had. If everybody’s on the same side, then it’s not much of a conversation,” Page tells CNN.Through his success in the ring, Page rose through Bellator’s welterweight division. And after leaving the championship last year, he signed with the UFC in free agency where he’ll make his welterweight debut against Holland in Miami.Page explains his training has been “extremely painful” for his fight with Holland, although he stresses that he won’t change much from what’s worked before.He will join a division whose titleholder is fellow Briton Leon Edwards.Although it remains a long way off at this point, a potential title fight between two British fighters in the UK is an ambition for Page.“So there’s certain times where I do turn to look out for the outside and everybody else that’s watching. And I don’t think it’s happened before, two UK fighters fighting for a UFC title,” said Page.“Regardless of the win, the belt stays in the UK, which is great for the UK, but also I think both me and him can build such a crowd and such an excitement for that fight that we could do it in a stadium, which I’d love to do.”"

        "text": "World No. 1 Iga Świątek brushed aside Maria Sakkari in straights sets to earn the second Indian Wells title of her career, beating the ninth seed 6-4 6-0 in Sunday’s final.The Polish superstar didn’t drop a set during the tournament and lost just 21 games en route to her second WTA 1000 title of the year after winning February’s Qatar Open.Świątek, who was stunned by Linda Noskova in the Australian Open third round, has now won her last six WTA finals to extend her career record to 19-4.“I’m really proud of myself,” Świątek said, per the WTA. “I’m super happy. I mean, even though this tournament looked like, the scores, maybe I had everything under control, it wasn’t from the beginning to the end so easy.“So I’m happy I could improve during the tournament. I felt really good on the last two matches, big amount of confidence.”Still only 22 years old, Świątek has already won four grand slam titles and eight WTA 1000 titles.In a rematch of the 2022 final – which Świątek clinched with a similarly imperious 6-4 6-1 win – the Pole narrowly edged a back-and-forth opening set, but the second was over in the blink of an eye.“I’m sorry I couldn’t put up a better fight,” Sakkari said in her on-court interview, according to the BBC. “It was pretty quick for you guys but credit to Iga, you’re an amazing player, a very good person and an incredible champion.“You really do deserve the best. You and your team have created something incredible. I’m really hoping we can play a lot more finals.”Up next for Świątek is the upcoming Miami Open where she will aim to win the ‘Sunshine Double’ – winning Indian Wells and the Florida tournament back-to-back – for the second time in her career."

        "title": "Players Championship: Ben Silverman spent all morning practicing one do-or-die shot. Here’s how it went",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Needing to make one miracle shot to stay in The Players Championship, it was do-or-die for Ben Silverman.In the fading Florida light on Friday, the Canadian golfer stood over his ball knowing he would need to send it 109 yards straight into the cup of his final hole to make the cut at the PGA Tour’s flagship event.Just then, play was suspended due to darkness at TPC Sawgrass. Rather than make his eagle attempt in low light, Silverman opted to mark his ball and return with playing partner Ryo Hisatsune – the only other player yet to finish – to complete his second round the following day.That left him time for a one-of-a-kind practice session on Saturday morning.Before the sun had even risen, the 36-year-old was out on the course’s driving range with his wedge, sending shot after shot towards a flag in a dress rehearsal of the do-or-die attempt to come.“Let’s go make it happen,” his caddie quipped as he left the range, recorded in a video posted by the PGA Tour on X.It would be some feat. One-over par overall as he arrived at the par-five ninth tee, Silverman – who started from the 10th hole – had to hole out from the fairway with his third shot to make it to the third round.Practice makes perfect but Silverman could not find the perfection he needed, as the world No. 117’s approach sailed wide over the green into a bunker.A subsequent bogey saw him sign off with a two-over 74 for the round, and two-over par overall – three shots short of the one-under par cut line.Yet there were no regrets from Silverman, a 14-year professional who has won twice on the Korn Ferry Tour, the PGA Tour’s developmental circuit.“There’s no point in putting so much pressure on it, just do the best I can,” reflected Silverman, who was making his Players Championship debut.“Didn’t go in – if it went in great, but I tried my best this week.”There was no joy for playing partner and fellow debutant Hisatsune either.The Japanese golfer teed off from the same hole Saturday morning at even-par overall, but saw his make-or-break 34-foot birdie putt come up just short to fall one shot short of the cut line.Big-name casualties that similarly failed to make it to the third round included multiple-major champions Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who dropped out after finishing one-over and two-over respectively.Winner of the event in 2021, Thomas had never missed the cut at the tournament in eight previous appearances.Wyndham Clark took a four stroke lead into the third round after shooting his second consecutive 65, with Xander Schauffele and Nick Taylor leading the chasing pack."

        "title": "Scottie Scheffler becomes first to ever defend Players Championship after Wyndham Clark’s crucial putt lips out",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Wyndham Clark thought his ball was in. TPC Sawgrass thought it was in. As it rolled around the cup, some of it actually was in.Yet somehow, someway, the birdie putt the American star needed to force world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler into a playoff lipped out, crowning his compatriot as the first ever back-to-back winner of The Players Championship.Scheffler mounted a stunning Sunday charge to overturn a five stroke deficit and defend his crown by the slimmest of margins in Florida, tearing around the Stadium Course with a closing eight-under 64 – tied for the lowest round of the tournament – to win by one stroke at 20-under par overall.Triumph at the 50th edition of the PGA Tour’s flagship event secured the 25-year-old a $4.5 million winner’s cut of a $25 million prize purse.His eighth victory on the PGA Tour and second in a matter of days after a dominant win at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week, Scheffler’s place as the dominant force in the men’s game is further cemented by an unprecedented defense of golf’s ‘fifth major’.“That’s something you never really get the opportunity to do very often,” he told reporters.“It’s tough enough to win one Players, so to have it back-to-back is extremely special. Really thankful.”Scheffler had eased to a commanding five shot victory a year ago, but had to withstand greater pressure from his rivals – and even his own body – to repeat the feat.The world No. 1 had played through neck pain for most of Friday’s second round, even receiving mid-play treatment from a physiotherapist.His swing was so affected that Scheffler had wondered if he would be able to continue playing, but stayed the course to shoot 69 and 68 before his final round flourish.“I’m a pretty competitive guy, and I didn’t want to give up in the tournament,” Scheffler said Sunday.“I did what I could to hang around until my neck got better. Today it felt really good. Marnus [physio] did a great job getting me going, getting it massaged out, and I was very thankful.”It was an agonizing end to another impressive week for reigning US Open winner and world No. 5 Clark, who was forced to settle for a share of second alongside fellow Americans Brian Harman and Xander Schauffele.All three had arrived at the final tee a stroke needing a birdie to make a playoff, but while reigning Open champion Harman and world No. 6 Schauffele got within a few feet of forcing Scheffler back out, Clark came within millimeters.Putting from over 16 feet, the 30-year-old looked to have measured his birdie effort perfectly. A few disbelieving moments later, he was tapping in for par.On his return to the clubhouse, Clark was still racking his brain as to how he didn’t finish with a 68.“I don’t know how that putt doesn’t go in,” Clark said.“It was kind of right center with like a foot to go, and I knew it was going to keep breaking, but it had speed and I thought it was going to go inside left. Even when it kind of lipped, I thought it would lip in.”It was yet another impressive week for the in-form Clark, who shattered the course record en route to being declared the winner of a storm-stricken Pebble Beach Pro-Am in California last month – not that it was any immediate consolation.“Maybe next week sometime I’ll really be able to look at those positives and feel good about it, but right now I’m pretty down,” he said.“Obviously there’s positives in it. You finish second, you get a bunch of points and money and all that stuff, but it just sucks. I’ve always wanted and dreamt about making a putt that really mattered to either force a playoff or win a tournament, and I have yet to do it in my professional career, so I was pretty bummed that I didn’t have one of those really awesome moments.“I’m still a little beside myself.”"

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "US tennis player Danielle Collins has had to fight harder than most during her time at the top of the sport.The 30-year-old has suffered from a number of health issues, including rheumatoid arthritis and endometriosis, but has still managed to forge a successful career.The 2022 Australian Open finalist announced in January that she would be retiring from the sport at the end of the current season and is currently enjoying her farewell tour.Speaking to reporters ahead of this week’s Indian Wells tournament, Collins opened up about those tough moments she has experienced in her sporting journey.“I’m also someone that has dealt with a lot of physical struggles and that has not been easy,” Collins said.“That wasn’t something that ended up defining my career. I was able to overcome a lot of it, and of course, there were challenges along the way, but I was able to play through two chronic inflammatory conditions and did pretty well.”Her health issues began in 2019 when she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis – a condition that causes pain and swelling in the body’s joints.Collins had been suffering from pain for a while before the diagnosis and, at the time, said it was a “relief” to learn about the cause of her discomfort.With treatment and a strategic plan in place to minimize the symptoms, Collins continued to compete but would soon face yet another hurdle.In April 2021, the American underwent emergency surgery for endometriosis where a tennis ball-sized cyst was removed.Collins has always been candid about her health struggles and said the pain from her endometriosis – a condition where the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside of it – was excruciating.“Had I not had the surgery, I just couldn’t keep living my life like that,” Collins she told the WTA website in 2021. “The agony that I experienced from my menstrual cycles and from the endometriosis is some of the worst pain I’ve ever had.”Somehow Collins found a way to manage and went on to achieve a career-high ranking of world No. 7 the following season.It was also the year she reached the final of the Australian Open and became America’s No. 1-ranked women’s player.“I do think those big wins are things that you probably look back on when you get older and you think very fondly of,” she told reporters this week, looking back at her career highlights.“I think when I get older, I’ll definitely look back on those matches and have fond memories and, hopefully by that time, it won’t be a blur.”At 30, it may seem like Collins is retiring early, but after giving so much to the sport, she is excited to travel less and is eager to raise a family.First, though, she has a few more tournaments to navigate and started her Indian Wells campaign with a first-round win against Erika Andreeva.The American, now ranked 56th in the world, will play world No. 1 Iga Świątek in the second round later on Friday.Whatever happens in her final season on tour, Collins will leave behind a legacy which could serve as inspiration for other athletes who find themselves struggling with their health."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "A wind-assisted wonder-goal from beyond the halfway line in the last minute of play allowed the Chicago Fire to storm back for a 4-3 home victory in its Major League Soccer (MLS) clash against CF Montréal on Saturday.Chicago had it all to do after Dominic Iankov extended the visiting side’s lead to 3-1 in the 70th minute but was offered a route back into the game when Montréal substitute Raheem Edwards received a straight red card after an infraction inside the penalty area.Brian Gutiérrez converted the resulting spot-kick 84 minutes into the game to halve the deficit before Hugo Cuypers leveled the score at 3-3 in the fifth of nine additional minutes to stun Montréal.The drama was far from over, however, as Chicago, not content with tying things up, went in search of a winner deep into stoppage time. With under a minute to go, it appeared that the home team’s efforts would be in vain as Kellyn Acosta picked up the ball inside his own half.With the Fire committing players up the pitch, the American midfielder hoisted the ball forward hoping for a miracle and the wind in the Windy City seemed to oblige. The Montréal defense could only watch in horror as Acosta’s effort – intended as a pass – swerved in the air and looped over goalkeeper Jonathan Sirois to give Chicago the unlikeliest of wins in the 90+9th minute.“That was pretty epic, pretty crazy,” Acosta said after the game. “The match had a bit of everything I would say but it was a good result so we’ll take it.”The 28-year-old admitted that his remarkable game-winning strike was unintentional.“For me it was just about getting the ball in the mixed zone basically and create some things,” he explained. “I had some balls that I found in the back post and if I’m being fully transparent that’s what I tried to do again.“This time though I had some St. Patrick’s Day luck, the wind was able to take it and for me it was one of those things that when it left my foot I was almost upset with myself like ‘Dang I kind of blew an opportunity.’ Then I realized ‘this might have a chance.’“He came out, it went over his head, and the rest was history.”Acosta’s goal, his first for the club after joining as a free agent in February, was the latest game-winning finish during regulation time of a Major League Soccer (MLS) regular season match, per the Fire.Chicago also became the first team in MLS history to score both a game-tying and game-winning goal in the 95th minute or later, as well as the first team in MLS history to win a match in regulation after scoring two-or-more-goals in the 84th minute or later.A comeback of these proportions has rarely been seen in the Windy City – the last time the Fire overturned a two-goal deficit to win was against the Colorado Rapids in August 2009, according to the team.The result saw Chicago enter the win column for the first time this season, while Montréal picked up its first defeat of the current campaign."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "An exhale of collective relief rippled around TPC Sawgrass as Austin Eckroat’s birdie putt finally abandoned its precarious position on the edge of the cup and dropped in. Yet the satisfaction would be short-lived.The American left with a par on the 11th hole during the final round of The Players Championship in Florida on Sunday, as a rule relating to the length of time a ball can overhang the hole saw him hit with a one stroke penalty.Eckroat, who won his first PGA Tour title at the Cognizant Classic earlier this month, had looked to have converted superbly from 20-feet, only for his ball to pause on the edge of the Stadium Course’s par-five 11th hole.The world No.48 and playing partner Joel Dahmen were crouched over the ball, staring intently, when it finally fell in almost 40 seconds later. It sparked a roar from the onlooking crowd, but a more muted reaction from Eckroat, whose mind had perhaps already drifted to a section of the Rules of Golf.Under rule 13.3a, a player is allowed “reasonable” time to reach the hole and 10 further seconds to wait and see if the ball drops in.Eckroat’s birdie would have stood had his putt fallen during this time, but as it was classed as being “at rest”, an additional penalty stroke saw him card par for the hole.The rule drew the ire of some fans responding to video of the incident posted by the PGA Tour on X. “Stupid rule,” replied Michael McEwen, deputy editor at golf site Bunkered.A similar series of events at last year’s PGA Championship involving American Lee Hodges saw the tournament’s rules body issue a statement explaining the penalty.There was no official statement from The Players rules committee for Eckroat’s incident as the penalty was “just the application of the rule,” a spokesperson for the PGA Tour told CNN.The penalty compounded what had been a frustrating final round for Eckroat.Having begun the day four-under par in tied-17th overall, two bogeys and a double bogey through his opening nine holes had dropped him back to even-par.He signed off with a four-over 76, his worst round of the week after shooting 71, 69, and 68 across the first three days.At 17-under par overall, world No.6 Xander Schauffele took a one shot lead into Sunday over reigning US Open champion Wyndham Clark, with a $4.5 million winner’s purse to come for the winner of the PGA Tour’s flagship event."

The Gamecocks are seeking to become the tenth team in women’s Division I history to finish the season as undefeated champions. They will play against the winner between First Four participants Sacred Heart and Presbyterian.Last year, South Carolina went undefeated in the SEC regular season and SEC tournament before being upset by Iowa in the Final Four.Led by the NCAA’s all-time Division I leading scorer Caitlin Clark, the Hawkeyes secured a No. 1 seed for the third time in program history and first time since 1992. The Hawkeyes will play against either Holy Cross or Tennessee-Martin in the first round.Iowa reached the national championship game last year but ultimately fell to Louisiana State, which is a No. 3 seed this year.Thirty-two teams automatically qualified in both the men’s and women’s tournament by virtue of winning their respective conference tournaments.A selection committee then determined which other teams receive one of 36 at-large bids for a total of 68 teams.

The term “Clark-onomics” has been coined to describe her huge impact off the court, such has been her ubiquity in pop culture.The 22-year-old has become the NCAA Division-I leading scorer across both men’s and women’s college basketball this year, and eclipsed NBA star Steph Curry’s record of the most three-pointers hit in a single NCAA Division-1 season.She is seeking to lead the Iowa Hawkeyes to an NCAA championship title, before heading to the WNBA where she is projected to be the No. 1 pick in this year’s draft.Angel ReeseAngel Reese is another of the tournament’s biggest stars, following her crucial role in propelling LSU to its first ever women’s college basketball title last year.Although LSU earned a No. 3 seed on Selection Sunday after succumbing to defeat against South Carolina in the SEC Tournament championship game, it is still expect to be one of the top contenders to defend its title.Reed SheppardWhile there has been a perceived drop in star power in men’s college basketball this season in comparison with previous seasons, there is still a host of NBA-ready talent to keep an eye on, such as Kentucky’s Reed Sheppard.The sharpshooting combo guard is projected to be selected third overall – the highest of any college player – in Bleacher Report’s latest 2024 NBA mock draft, after a late-season surge in scoring appears to have turned the heads of NBA scouts. His ability to fill it up as well as stifle opponents on the defensive end make him one to watch in the tournament.Zach EdeyAnother name to look out for is Zach Edey. The seven-foot-four, 300lb center is the tallest player in Big Ten conference history and the reigning consensus national player of the year.While his seemingly unstoppable post presence and footwork might not translate to the NBA, he is a dominant college player who is seeking to lead Purdue, one of the tournament favorites, to a national championship."

        "title": "She battled sub-zero temperatures and ferocious winds to record the longest-ever run in Antarctica",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "It was on her third day of running consecutive ultramarathons in Antarctica that Donna Urquhart felt the full force of the continent’s brutal conditions: violent winds, bitter cold and such poor visibility that she couldn’t even see her feet.Frequently stumbling as she struggled to put one foot in front of the other, Urquhart became anxious, especially when she noticed that she had veered away from the flags marking her route.“It was like running in a cloud,” she tells CNN Sport. “That was really hard. It was sometimes snowing, and I was really surprised how disoriented we became.“I’d never been to a polar region before. I hadn’t been to Antarctica, hadn’t experienced those conditions. I was quite fearful of going out and worried about my safety in terms of hypothermia and frostbite.”This was Urquhart’s first week of running 871 miles (1,402 kilometers) over the course of 28 days in Antarctica, setting the record for the longest-ever run in a polar region.Pat Farmer, a former Australian politician turned ultrarunner, set the previous record in 2012, though the 49-year-old Urquhart’s attempt is still pending ratification.Starting on December 15, she fought through temperatures as low as -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius) and winds as strong as 50 miles per hour (about 80.5 km/h) – moments in which Antarctica lived up to its reputation as the coldest, windiest, driest place on earth.“It was a whole mix of emotions,” Urquhart says about breaking the record, a challenge she dubbed Run Antarctica.“Obviously being really happy and relieved, being a little bit emotional and teary, but I think probably the main feeling I had was just feeling really proud of what I and our team had achieved.“It was a long journey. We didn’t even know whether we could get to Antarctica in the first place. The funding and the logistics are massive.”Australian Urquhart, who lives in Melbourne, is an experienced ultramarathon runner – a broad term describing any athlete who runs further than the 26.2 miles of a standard marathon – and also works as a researcher and scientist.She has investigated the relationship between pain and endurance sports – some even describing her as a “pain scientist” – and has first-hand experience of the kind of energy-sapping discomfort to which ultramarathon runners are accustomed.But running on Antarctica’s Union Glacier exposed Urquhart to a wholly different challenge, particularly for someone used to Australia’s warm weather and sandy beaches.“No female had attempted this before,” she says, “so that was certainly intriguing for me to be exploring untouched opportunities.”Fascinated by Antarctica’s unspoiled landscape – “the beauty, the vastness, the fact that it’s really untouched” – Urquhart spent 10 months preparing for the challenge, turning to some unusual training methods.A container company allowed her to put a treadmill in a refrigerated storage unit and run for three or four hours in sub-zero temperatures each weekend, while she also partnered with an automotive parts company to train inside an industrial wind tunnel.“We learned that anything over 80 kilometers per hour [roughly 50 mph] is just incredibly dangerous and cold,” says Urquhart.“It was a really useful exercise. We also learned how cold is cold, but when you have cold and wind together, that is just another X factor again. The wind just brings the temperature down so significantly.”On less extreme training days, she would run along the beaches in Melbourne, anticipating that the uneven surface would simulate the varied terrain in Antarctica.That proved useful preparation: Urquhart often found herself stumbling and falling in the snow, while the soles of her feet also became sore from the load of running more than 30 miles (around 48 kilometers) each day. Two weeks on, she still had lots of soft tissue swelling in her feet.The challenges that Urquhart faced in Antarctica were numerous. She would eat about 5,000 calories per day: a mix of powders, gels, sports bars and dehydrated food she had brought from home, as well as the meals she could access in the Union Glacier camp.Accommodation came in the form of a two-person tent which she shared with her husband, but the continent’s 24 hours of sunlight in the summer months, combined with the sound of howling winds, were hardly conducive to a good night’s sleep.Clothing was also crucial. Urquhart would usually wear four layers – two thermal tops, a fleece and a windbreaker jacket – but had to pay close attention to her body temperature while running.“It’s really important obviously not to get too cold because you’re at risk of hypothermia and frostbite,” she explains, “but it’s actually also about not getting too hot.“If you get too hot, then you sweat; sweat can make you really cold, even freeze on your skin in some situations. And then that can lead to hypothermia as well.”Happily, Urquhart’s body soon adapted to the physical rigors of running 30-plus miles each day, and she never tired of looping around the same 10-kilometer (6.21-mile) route, instead finding it almost therapeutic.“I kind of enjoyed the fact that it was something that was familiar in that unfamiliar world of being in a polar region that could constantly change and vary,” she says. “It was actually quite comforting to me.”Finding comfort in the face of hardship and struggle is a skill that ultrarunners acquire quicker than most, especially in a sport which requires resilience to trump pain and mind to conquer matter.“It fascinates me that something so profound and so special can also be so tough,” says Urquhart. “It’s like a two-edged sword, and Antarctica is the same. It has such beauty but is also so brutal.”Still unsure about what her next running challenge will involve, Urquhart is currently dedicating herself to empowering more girls to participate in sport.Run Antarctica was launched to increase awareness for young women who find sporting environments stressful or intimidating, and she has set a target of raising 1.5 million Australian dollars (about $990,000) for charity.“Confidence is a real issue for females,” says Urquhart. “Feeling self-conscious, body image issues. And a sporting environment provides a great opportunity to learn skills, not only physical skills but mental and resilient skills as well.”This formed a huge inspiration behind her record-breaking run in Antarctica, taking on a challenge that no other woman had attempted before.“It was actually showing what females are capable of doing and that we can push our limits, we can explore what’s possible,” says Urquhart.And what better way of doing this than running mile after mile – after mile – in one of the most savage, inhospitable places on earth."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Three Rapid Vienna soccer players were not selected for national team duty after video emerged of them taking part in post-match celebrations shouting homophobic chants with a selection of the crowd.Guido Burgstaller, Marco Grüll and Niklas Hedl were seen, among others, chanting after the club defeated rivals Austria Vienna on February 25.Austria’s men’s national team manager Ralf Rangnick said he left the trio out for the upcoming fixtures against Slovakia and Turkey after he and the coaching staff watched videos of the incident.Rangnick said Tuesday the three apologized to him, but he expected the players to “really take a serious look at this issue and understand what it means for people when they are publicly insulted and discriminated in this way. That’s something I won’t tolerate in my team.”The former interim manager for Manchester United said the decision was not permanent, but the players would have to prove they have learned from their actions.“Paying lip service to an apology because they’ve now realized what an echo it has caused is no excuse,” Rangnick continued. “For me, it’s not about what you can say, you can say a lot. The deciding factor is what the behavior looks like.”Burgstaller, Rapid Vienna’s club captain, issued an apology online for the “absolute misconduct.”“We bear full responsibility for what happened and deeply regret this action. We all distance ourselves from any kind of discrimination and homophobia and will deal with this issue internally within the club and the team and take further action in this regard,” he said.Grüll also issued a statement accepting any forthcoming consequences and to “sincerely apologize.”“Like my fellow players, I also clearly distance myself from any kind of exclusion; homophobia must have no place in our society,” Grüll stated.The club released a statement the day after the match win, saying: “You can see and hear inappropriate and insulting statements that should not have been made like that and for which SK Rapid as a whole can only ask for forgiveness.”The Austrian Football League has suspended Burgstaller, Grüll, Hedl, as well as teammates Thorsten Schick and Maximilian Hofmann.The club’s managing director Steffen Hofmann and assistant coach Stefan Kulovits were also disciplined by the league."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Novak Djokovic was stunned by world No. 123 Luca Nardi in the third round of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells on Monday as the Italian secured a remarkable 6-4 3-6 6-3 win.Nardi was only playing after been awarded a ‘lucky loser’ spot having already lost in the qualifying rounds to David Goffin. A ‘lucky loser’ slot is given to players defeated in the qualifying phase allowing them to fill in the main draw for injured players who have to pull out before the first round.Nardi has certainly made his participation count, beating Zhang Zhizhen in the second round of the main draw and then recording this impressive victory over Djokovic.In doing so, Nardi became the lowest-ranked player to defeat Djokovic at the ATP Masters 1000 or grand slam level, according to the ATP. The 20-year-old also is now the fourth lowest-ranked player to beat a reigning world No. 1 at a Masters 1000 event.After the defeat, Djokovic was extremely critical of his own performance, while also acknowledging Nardi deserved the win.“He got in as a lucky loser to the main draw, so he really didn’t have anything to lose, so he played great. Deserved to win. I was more surprised with my level. My level was really, really bad,” Djokovic said.“These two things come together. He’s having a great day; I’m having a really bad day. Results as a negative outcome for me.”The Indian Wells tournament was Djokovic’s first competitive action since losing to another young Italian – the 22-year-old Jannik Sinner – in the semifinals of the Australian Open in January.Having struggled past Australia’s Aleksandar Vukic in his first match of the tournament in California, the 36-year-old Djokovic never looked settled against Nardi.A tight first set was eventually won by the 20-year-old Italian and although Djokovic managed to level the match in the second set, he couldn’t keep up with Nardi in the decider.Djokovic saved three break points early in the third set, but was unable to do so in the sixth game when he was 0-40 down. It proved to be the turning point of the match as Nardi held on to claim a famous victory in two hours and 20 minutes.Djokovic, who had been chasing a record sixth title at Indian Wells, expressed his concern about his form in 2024.“No titles this year. That’s not something I’m used to. I was starting the season most of my career with a Grand Slam win or a Dubai win or any tournament,” the 36-year-old said.“It is part of the sport. You just have to accept it. Some you win; some you lose. Hopefully I’ll win some more and still keep going.“I guess every trophy that eventually comes my way is going to be great. Obviously to break the kind of negative cycle a little bit I’m having in the last three, four tournaments where I haven’t really been close to my best.”Nardi, who will now face the US’ Tommy Paul in the next round, couldn’t hide his disbelief at his victory.“I don’t know [how I held my nerve],” Nardi said of the tense finish. “I think it is a miracle, because I am a 20-year-old guy, 100 in the world, and beating Novak. It’s crazy.”Nardi added: “I think that before this night no one knew me. I hope that the crowd enjoyed the game. I’m super happy with this one.”"

        "text": "Carlos Alcaraz won his first trophy since Wimbledon last year as he successfully defended his Indian Wells title against Daniil Medvedev.In a repeat of last year’s final, Alcaraz triumphed 7-6(5) 6-1 in California on Sunday, recovering from an early 3-0 deficit in the opening set to win the 13th ATP Tour title of his young career.The 20-year-old Spaniard is also the first person to win back-to-back Indian Wells titles since Novak Djokovic in 2016.“I think this year it’s a little bit more special for me because before the tournament I was thinking about if I’m going to play my best or not,” Alcaraz said in his on-court interview.“I was not feeling well with my ankle. Weeks before the tournament I was hitting for 30 minutes with no movement. It was a lot of doubts for me but really happy to be able to overcome the problems.”That’s not to say the tournament itself wasn’t without challenges for Alcaraz. His quarterfinal against Alexander Zverev was affected by a swarm of bees and he then had to come from a set down against Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner in the semifinals.The Spaniard faced more adversity when Medvedev broke him in his first service game of the final, but Alcaraz hit back with a break of his own before edging his Russian opponent in a tie-break which at one point was locked at 5-5.The second set was more straight forward for Alcaraz as he broke Medvedev twice – at 1-0 and 4-1 – before completing the victory in an hour and 42 minutes when the world No. 4 sent a cross-court forehand wide.The 20-year-old Alcaraz ended the match with 23 winners – 19 of which were on his forehand side – compared to Medvedev’s 11 and won 73% of his service points to the Russian’s 56%.Alcaraz now joins compatriot Rafael Nadal as the second male player to win five Masters 1,000 tournaments before the age of 21.Earlier on Sunday, Iga Świątek also won her second Indian Wells title as she defeated Greece’s Maria Sakkari 6-4 6-0.The Polish World No. 1, who also beat Sakkari in the final two years ago, didn’t drop a set over the course of the tournament and needed just 68 minutes to wrap up the title, winning eight games in a row across the first and second sets.It marked the 19th WTA Tour title of Świątek’s career and her second this year after winning the Qatar Open last month."

You have to be strong mentally if you want to overcome these kind of matches, a set down against someone that’s playing an unbelievable game. I’m really happy with the things that I’ve done after that.”After heavy rain had delayed the start of the match, Sinner took the opening set 6-1, seeming utterly dominant, winning four consecutive games and facing just one break point.But Alcaraz rallied in the second set, holding his first service game even as it went to deuce and used that platform to launch his comeback. Every previous clash between these two young stars has produced otherworldly rallies, and this one was no different as they scampered all over the court, playing 19 net points in the second set alone.“Every time that I’m going to face Jannik I’m going to get nervous,” Alcaraz added, per the ATP. “That’s for sure, because I know that I have to play 100 per cent if I want to beat him … It gives me extra motivation to give my 100 per cent, just to beat him in that head-to-head.”And Alcaraz drove home his advantage in the deciding third set, breaking Sinner at the second opportunity before winning five consecutive games to put the match beyond his opponent’s reach.“I was too predictable at some points,” Sinner said afterwards, according to the tournament website. “I think that’s the lesson for today. We will work on certain things, and hopefully I will get better.”Alcaraz will now face Daniil Medvedev on Sunday in the Indian Wells men’s final as he seeks to defend his title."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "A bizarre end to the game overshadowed the Golden State Warriors’ 128-121 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday at Crypto.com Arena, as a broken shot clock and controversial call overruling a LeBron James three-pointer conspired to add a 23-minute delay to the game’s final two minutes.With less than two minutes remaining and the Lakers trailing the Warriors by just four points, the latest chapter in their rivalry seemed to be heading towards a thrilling conclusion.But James’ three-pointer was scratched out after he netted it when officials ruled that he had stepped out of bounds, increasing the Lakers’ deficit to seven with just 1:50 remaining.Then, the shot clock malfunctioned and after several attempts to restart the game and fix the clock, referees eventually determined that the arena PA announcer would announce the time left on the clock at five second intervals in real time.“I’ve never seen that be called before like that – in that particular time,” James said afterwards, according to ESPN. “That was kind of weird. … It took some momentum away from us.”He finished the game with 40 points, matching his season high, nine assists and eight rebounds, as he attempted to drag his team to victory without Anthony Davis, who had left the game with an injury after the first quarter.James’ longtime rival Steph Curry contributed 31 points for the Warriors as he returned to the court after three games away with a sprained right ankle, while Klay Thompson added 26 points from the bench.“(The ending) was bizarre.” Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters afterwards. “It seems a few times a year you get clock issues. That’s about as extreme as I’ve ever been a part of where the back up unit doesn’t work either. It’s unfortunate, I felt bad for the fans.“That was a great game and all of a sudden, the last two minutes everyone is just kind of looking at each other wondering what to do.”It had been a finely poised game throughout even after the Lakers had lost Davis and his defensive nous, which allowed the Warriors to attack more from inside the paint, racking up points in that area of the court.But the game’s “flow” was interrupted following the challenge to James’ three-pointer, Kerr said afterward, adding he would “love to see that rule go away.”“We’re trying so hard to get everything just right at the expense of the flow. Who cares if the guy’s foot is half an inch (over) … is that worth going back 45 seconds and changing everything?”James, however, defended the decision, adding that while it was “unfortunate what happened,” the referees “have a job to do, and they have to do it the best they can.”"

        "title": "A doping free-for-all Enhanced Games calls itself the answer to doping in sports. Opponents say it poses a danger to health",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world’s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what “faster, higher, stronger” – the former motto of the Games – might represent.The Enhanced Games says it is an “alternative” to what it calls the “corrupt Olympics Games.”Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won’t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete.That’s quite a contrast to the Olympics’ doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024’s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals.When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that “the idea does not merit any comment.”CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition.Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia’s state-sponsored doping program – a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 – said that the Enhanced Games is a “danger to health, to sport.”Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations.The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D’Souza. He is also the founding editor of “The Journal Jurisprudence,” a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an “avid athlete.”Recently, D’Souza told CNN Sport he has “signed term sheets with prominent venture capital firms” in relation to the Enhanced Games and is “waiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.” He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December.Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement.D’Souza believes what he calls a “science-driven” competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field.According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope.However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%.Faiss and his team compared athletes’ blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they’re actually doping.This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a “robust way” of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping.In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: “Determining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,” explaining that, since 2017, a “prevalence working group” has been established to “determine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.”WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered “several recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.”WADA has reservations about Faiss’ study and pointed to the “complexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,” highlighting that reports have “greatly varying results.”The anti-doping organization added: “No single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.”“Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence.“In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others.“The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.”Editor’s note: You can find WADA’s full statement at the bottom of this article.Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is “farcical … likely illegal in many [US] states” and “a dangerous clown show, not real sport.”Substances such as anabolic steroids – which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts – are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration.When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “we will not be drug testing at the games.”He added: “We do not propose to regulate what athletes use.”Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine.But that isn’t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov.“If you look at the Enhanced Games website, it’s almost as though they’re advertising their disregard of the law,” Walden told CNN Sport.“They wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete.“I hope they’re thinking hard about how they’re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that’s focusing on these very issues.”The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to “protect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,” according to the government website.The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, “degrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.”“The use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,” Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN.“Promotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit.“It might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.”Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games’ organizers “might get investigated […] under the Rodchenkov Act.”The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events.However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don’t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn’t do.Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 – “Prohibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person” – of the World Anti-Doping Code.USADA’s Tygart also told CNN Sport: “No one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.”D’Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn’t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he’d continue to be a “quiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.”“I do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one’s interested in histories in the past anymore,” said D’Souza.“They’re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.”According to Pierre de Coubertin – the founder of the modern Olympics – “for every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.”Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called “the dirtiest Olympics in history.”When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing.Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event’s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history.Six of the eight finalists – notably the winner, Ben Johnson – who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers.Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers.Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep “elite podiums and finals clean,” according to the anti-doping organization.Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year’s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals.Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests.Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues.“It’s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,” said Faiss.Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is “getting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.”By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night.“Athletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,” he said, adding that “EPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.”Athletes “use the drugs that are actively working.”When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat – the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance – Faiss said athletes “are likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.”Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health.Athletes are “seeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won’t be caught,” said Faiss.Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will “give a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we’re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.”Verroken also questions what’s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards.Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is “setting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.”Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it “dangerous and irresponsible,” saying that “the world needs better than this.”UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it “is extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,” adding that “there is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.”UKAD’s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a “hugely dangerous precedent,” expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes.When CNN Sport spoke to D’Souza shortly after the proposed event’s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media.The organization’s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that “very accomplished athletes” at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out “to understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.”Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers “already have an Olympic medallist” for their athlete commission, though he didn’t specify who that was.He also said there has been “a lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.” Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage.For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories – track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts.The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget.Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events.The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion – almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC’s philosophy of “lower-impact Games” in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics.D’Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to “deliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games” so profits can be shared with the athletes.He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt’s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds.“I’ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said […] if there’s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I’ll be there,” said D’Souza.Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an “enhanced athletes programme.”When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “our athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.”He said: “We will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.”“This will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.”D’Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order to compete.As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D’Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships.“We’re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,” added D’Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would “never” coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach.“Having been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won’t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],” Painter told CNN Sport.If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D’Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity.But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even “undermine the very purpose of the sport in question.”Devine told CNN Sport that “performance-enhancing drugs don’t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.”He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: “To what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes’ sporting excellence?”WADA response in full:Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a Working Group on Doping Prevalence in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs.WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group’s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation.This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results.The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be.Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, the night before he was scheduled to face Canadian Milos Raonic in the first round, he announced on social media Wednesday.In an announcement on X, the 22-time Grand Slam winner said he’s dropping out of the tennis tournament because he doesn’t feel prepared enough to compete at “the highest level.” The three-time Indian Wells champion holds a 59-11 record at Indian Wells, according to ATP Tour.“It is with great sadness that I have to withdraw from this amazing tournament at Indian Wells,” Nadal wrote. “Everyone knows how much I love this place and how much I love to play here. That’s also one of the reasons why I came very early to the desert to practice and try to get ready.”The 37-year-old was scheduled to play in the first round against Raonic on Thursday, but Indian player Sumit Nagal has taken Nadal’s place in the draw, a news release said. The BNP Paribas Open runs through March 17 at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.Nadal has not played on the world tour since the Brisbane International in January, where he made a much-awaited comeback after a hip injury. Earlier this week, the fan-favorite participated in the inaugural “Netflix Slam” against compatriot Carlos Alcaraz in Las Vegas. Alcaraz defeated Nadal in the exhibition match.“I have been working hard and practicing and you all know I took a test this weekend but I don’t find myself ready to play at the highest level at such an important event,” Nadal said in the announcement. “It is not an easy decision, it’s a tough one as a matter of fact but I can’t lie to myself and lie to the thousands of fans. I will miss you all and I am sure the tournament will be a great success.”The player has battled a series of injuries in recent years, which caused him to miss several major tournaments. Nadal said in May 2023 that 2024 would likely be his last year on tour, though he didn’t rule out continuing past that date.Tournament director Tommy Haas said he was “disappointed” Nadal would be withdrawing but wished him “continued healing and hope he can be back in action again soon.”“He is one of the all-time fan favorites here, and we hope to see him back in Indian Wells again in the future,” Haas continued."

        "title": "‘Breaking has total freedom for me,’ says Menno van Gorp, a medal hopeful in the newest Olympic sport",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "To the tune of a Miles Davis trumpet solo, Menno van Gorp is stepping up his training ahead of this year’s Paris Olympics.The jazz musician has been an influential figure in van Gorp’s breakdance career, his smooth sound and freewheeling rhythms a constant source of inspiration for each new routine.“I love to practice on jazz,” van Gorp tells CNN Sport. “It gives me more freedom and it just triggers more creativity when I move to jazz. Also, the part of improvisation in jazz is huge. I think that really reflects well with breaking.”The 35-year-old van Gorp, a competitive b-boy from the Netherlands known simply as Menno, is a medal hopeful at the upcoming Olympics, where breakdance – or breaking – will make its debut as the Games’ newest sport.Suddenly seeing their discipline labeled as a sport isn’t something that necessarily sits comfortably with b-boys and b-girls – the name given to men and women who compete in breaking.It has some similarities with pre-existing Olympic events like martial arts, gymnastics, and skateboarding, but will also bring its own subversive identity to this year’s Games.“We’re under the flag of sports now, but to me, it’s still also an art,” says van Gorp, who calls himself an “artlete” on social media. “I think breaking is so unique that it’s impossible to put it in one box … It’s many things together, and it’s also an expression.”A high-scoring breakdance routine requires a unique blend of strength, stamina, agility, and flexibility, as well as the mental wherewithal to ensure that moves aren’t repeated and flow seamlessly into each other.“You use literally every part of your body,” says van Gorp, “including your ears and your brains and your heart and your toes and your heels … I use my fingertips; I use the point of my elbow – every part in your body that you can use.“It takes a lot of physical abilities, I think, to be a good breaker.”Van Gorp practiced judo before he took up breaking, which found a foothold in his hometown of Tilburg during the 1990s.“First everybody was collecting Pokémon cards, then everybody was yo-yoing,” he says. “Suddenly, everybody started breaking.”After eight years of judo, he had started to find the sport too restrictive, the scope for creativity too narrow.“Breaking gave me so much freedom compared to judo,” van Gorp adds. “Breaking has total freedom for me, so that’s why I really liked it. In other sports, you’re always limited by a lot of rules.”Originating in New York in the late 1960s, breaking has since gained global popularity and today is synonymous with a specific subgenre of street style – sneakers, sweatpants, and baseball caps worn at an angle.Van Gorp, like many kids discovering breakdance for the first time in the early 2000s, gained insight from watching grainy videos and talking through routines with his friends before joining practices around the Netherlands and overseas.It was in winning the UK championships in 2007 that van Gorp says he “exploded onto the scene” and started to compete more regularly.He has gone on to win titles all over the world, including at the 2019 WDSF World Breaking Championship and three victories at the Red Bull BC One World Finals – a feat only matched by South Korean b-boy Hong 10.Breaking is the first World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) event to be added to the Olympic program, and in Paris, 16 b-boys and 16 b-girls will face off in one-on-one battles set against a DJ’s hip-hop soundtrack.They take it in turns to perform a routine and are scored by a panel of judges based on six criteria: creativity, personality, technique, performativity, variety, and musicality.With the Olympics in mind, van Gorp is breaking for up to two and a half hours each day, plus gym sessions and calisthenics – body-weight strength training like push-ups and sit-ups – in pursuit of winning gold.Such an accolade, he says, would be a huge boost for his profile.“I’m building here a dance studio in Rotterdam and I’m working also on the new generation here,” van Gorp explains. “Getting a medal I think would be so helpful for my career after breaking to make stuff happen for the next generation – that type of stamp on your name.”On top of establishing his dance school, van Gorp is also an amateur photographer; he paints – typically large canvasses streaked in brightly-colored lines – has his own clothes brand and is a father of two.His life, therefore, is a juggling act while training for the Olympics, which is all-consuming at the moment. In order to qualify for the Games, van Gorp will hope to earn selection via the Olympic Qualifier Series in May and June.Like every breaking competition, that will test not only his movement and creativity in the heat of a battle but also his memory: originality is rewarded, and contestants are scored down for repeating moves between rounds.“It all comes down to preparation,” says van Gorp. “I study my material a lot. I’ve found memory hacks to remember my stuff, so I give names to my moves. I make rhymes, I connect them with moments in life. I connect them with music I like.“And I write stuff down, I try it, I read it back, I visualize, and you pick between competitions what material you have left. And then in the battle it should all just fall in place.”Van Gorp compares himself to a “cage fighter” in the middle of a battle – “I really need to have that fire … it’s not about being a nice guy anymore,” he says – and believes that he thrives on being spontaneous and unpredictable during competitions.“A lot of unexpected movements, a lot of creativity,” he identifies as features of his routines. “My style is definitely based on flow and transitions, and I think you need to have a very well-trained eye to understand what I’m really doing.“If you blink one time or if you look away, you might have missed an important detail.”Having a unique style can be key in breaking, as it is with any form of art or music. It’s something that has drawn van Gorp to Miles Davis in particular.“To see how many times he reinvented himself and he still stayed authentic to himself, that’s a huge inspiration for me,” he says.Few other, if any, athletes will be honing their craft to the emotive sounds of jazz music ahead of this year’s Olympics, but that’s part of what makes breaking such an intriguing addition.“If you want to make art,” says van Gorp, “you want to make something that’s really you – not somebody else.”"

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Over the last 50 years, only a few golfers have ever bagged a hole-in-one at The Players Championship. On Thursday, New Zealand’s Ryan Fox joined that select band.It had been a somewhat muted start for the world No. 44 at TPC Sawgrass. Yet after going one-over par through the opening six holes of his first round at ‘the fifth major’ on Thursday, the world No.44 followed up an eagle with an ace at the Stadium Course’s iconic par-three 17th hole to rocket to three-under in the blink of an eye.A perfect tee shot clinched Fox’s first ever hole-in-one on the PGA Tour, and the first of this year’s tournament.“It’s such an iconic hole, and to have that many people there to witness it is pretty cool,” Fox told reporters after carding a three-under 69 for the round.“You get up there and most of the crowd probably either wants you to make a one or hit it in the water, so I’m glad to be on the right side of it in that respect.”The effort sees the 37-year-old join a group of just 13 other golfers to have conquered the island green in one shot.And after a stunning approach shot – just shy of 180 yards to within a few feet of the cup – at the par-five 16th hole had set up another eagle, Fox’s subsequent ace made him the first player in the tournament’s 50-year history to make back-to-back eagles on any two holes.It continues a prolific recent run for hole-in-ones at the 17th. After just three from over 7,400 tee shots between 2000 and 2016 – and none between 2003 and 2015 – there have now been eight aces on the hole across the last nine editions of the event.Last year there was a record three aces courtesy of Hayden Buckley, Aaron Rai and Alex Smalley before Scottie Scheffler cruised to a five stroke victory.A bogey at the 18th saw Fox – who had started his round from the 10th – make the turn at two-under par. A four-time winner on the DP World (European) Tour, Fox is chasing a first victory on the PGA Tour at the circuit’s flagship event.This year’s champion will claim a $4.5 million cut of a $25 million prize purse – the largest of any regular season-PGA Tour event, including last year’s majors."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "A Women’s Super League (WSL) clash between Chelsea and Arsenal on Friday was delayed by half an hour after the Gunners were forced to change their socks because they were the same color as those worn by Chelsea.Both teams initially wore white socks, contrary to regulations which require each team to wear different colors. Arsenal, as the away team, was eventually forced to source black socks from Chelsea’s merchandise store and cover the branding with tape.Once the game began, Chelsea consolidated its spot as the league leader with a 3-1 victory over third-placed Arsenal in front of the Blues’ biggest ever crowd at Stamford Bridge for a women’s soccer game.Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall later admitted to broadcaster Sky Sports that he had “no idea” why his players were wearing the wrong socks, adding that the delay didn’t affect their performance since it was “the same for both teams.”Star forward Lauren James opened the scoring for Chelsea in the 14th minute, beating two defenders and rifling the ball towards Arsenal goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger who attempted to parry it back as it looped over her and into the net.Just six minutes later, Sjoeke Nüsken doubled Chelsea’s lead after latching onto Cuthbert’s pass in the box and nudging the ball into the net. Nüsken completed her brace before halftime, her back deflecting Johanna Rytting Kaneryd’s shot into the net and giving Chelsea a 3-0 lead.A consolation goal in the 86th minute gave Arsenal small hope, but the Gunners were unable to launch any late offensive.Chelsea manager Emma Hayes praised her team’s dominant performance afterwards but told broadcaster Sky Sports that she was “gutted” for Arsenal’s kit man.“It’s so easy to have a dig but I’m gutted for him because they’re new people, it’s the last thing he probably wanted,” said Hayes. “If we had a change of socks then I would have put them on for us.“It didn’t derail us whatsoever,” she added. “The girls delivered the exact performance I was looking for … they were all magnificent.”"

        "title": "Seth Towns: In his eighth season of college basketball, 26 year-old is headed back to March Madness",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "There is not a player in college basketball quite like Seth Towns.Now 26 years old, Towns is a Harvard graduate who has already stepped away from basketball once in the past and is an extremely rare eighth-year senior after a collegiate career derailed by injuries.For comparison, five-time All-Star Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics is currently playing his seventh NBA season after being drafted in 2017, but is four months younger than Towns.Now at Howard University in Washington D.C., Towns is heading back to March Madness after the Bison beat Delaware State 70-67 on Saturday to win a second-straight Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference title and punch their ticket to the tournament.It has been a remarkable journey for the Ohio native, who only returned to the court for the current season having been sidelined since the 2020-21 campaign.Towns – a six-foot-nine small forward – began his college career with Harvard in 2016, averaging 12.3 points per game, before his scoring leapt to 16 points per game while shooting 44% from three-point range as a sophomore the following season.He was named Ivy League Player of the Year in 2018 and seemingly a future in the NBA was potentially on the horizon.Unfortunately for Towns, he suffered a knee injury that saw him miss his entire junior season before undergoing knee surgery in December 2019 that ended his senior year before it had even begun and brought his promising Harvard career to a halt.Towns graduated from Harvard the following year and entered the NCAA transfer portal. He eventually committed to Ohio State as a graduate transfer for what would technically be his junior season after receiving medical redshirts for the campaigns that he missed due to injury.He described the decision as returning “home” on social media at the time.“Eternally grateful this opportunity and cannot wait to fight for the city of Columbus—the city I call home,” Towns wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in March 2020. “This means everything to me, from the bottom of my heart.”Towns then averaged 3.8 points in the 2020-21 season as the Buckeyes earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament.However, Towns was hit by injury again and, forced to undergo back surgery, sat out the entirety of his redshirt senior year.He was expected to return for the 2022-23 campaign but announced in September 2022 that he was stepping away from Ohio State due to mounting health concerns.“After a few setbacks this summer and some tough conversations with my coaches and medical personnel, it has become clear that my body is not in a position to endure a full Big Ten season,” he said on Instagram.“I share with many of you the frustration of not having been able to compete at the level I am capable of, or at least something close to it.”Towns knew that this step could mark the end of his basketball career.“I knew that it was possible that it was over for good. I also knew it was possible it wasn’t,” Towns told ESPN. “It was a step away from Ohio State and maybe a step away from basketball. I wasn’t sure. It was definitely really tough having to meet that kind of reality.”After spending his year off, during which he weighed up his future in the sport, Towns entered the transfer portal again in May 2023 and committed to Howard.Despite being his eighth year at the college level, the current season is only Towns’ fourth where he has actually taken to the court. And coming into the season, he had only played in 25 games – none of them as a starter – in the previous three years.Thankfully for Towns, he was able to start afresh at Howard as one of college basketball’s most unique players. The 26-year-old is averaging 14.2 points per game and helped the Bison secure a berth in the NCAA tournament, marking his first appearance at the Big Dance since 2021.“If all things are equal and he doesn’t have injuries, he’s in his fourth or fifth year in the NBA. And yet he’s fighting and scratching and clawing his ass off every day for us at Howard,” Bison coach Kenny Blakeney told ESPN.Towns and Howard will take on the Wagner Seahawks in the First Four on Tuesday. The winner of that game will face No. 1 seed North Carolina in the round of 64."

        "title": "‘Relief from everyday life’: How soccer is helping Ukrainian soldiers who have lost limbs in the war against Russia",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Breathing heavily, Oleksandr Malchevsky puts on his prosthesis and hurries home to his wife and son. The 39-year-old has just lost a soccer game, but he isn’t too upset. For him, the sport is more than just a game – it’s about helping his rehabilitation as he adjusts to civilian life.Malchevsky is a Ukrainian soldier who lost part of his leg fighting in Eastern Ukraine. He voluntarily joined the army when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and served as a gunner. Last year in the Kharkiv region, he came under mortar fire and was seriously injured. The doctors saved his left leg but had to amputate part of his right limb.After a year of painful rehabilitation, Malchevsky returned to Kyiv – his native city – and joined the soccer team with other soldiers who had lost limbs fighting for Ukraine.“All my life, I played football in this stadium. When I returned with an injury from the frontline, I was unsure what to do. I joined the team, and I have to say that I’m happy. Here I get a moral relief from everyday life,” Malchevsky, who was discharged from the army for health reasons, told CNN Sport.Amputees, both civilians and soldiers, play football at the small Bannikov Stadium in the center of Kyiv every Thursday. The sessions normally run for two hours and allow the amputees to practice skills, perform strength and conditioning exercises and play games.The Ukrainian Football Federation organized this initiative a few months ago to support soldiers who lost limbs and help their rehabilitation and return to normal life. There are both men and women. Some of them were injured after the 2022 invasion, while others lost limbs following the start of the war in Ukraine in 2014.Reportedly over 20,000 Ukrainians have needed amputations since the war began in February 2022. The coach in charge of Thursday’s session is Dmytro Rzondkovsky. He says there are not many people playing at the moment, but he hopes more will come.“I think football provides psychological support, first of all,” Rzondkovsky, who is also the coach of the Ukrainian amputee football team, told CNN.“Here, these people find new friends and communication. I was really surprised by how much these people love life, football, and sports. This love of life is something I’m still learning from them.”Rzondkovsky is a professional football coach and has a UEFA B license qualification. UEFA is European soccer’s governing body.Even though Thursday’s session doesn’t involve professional players, this project is important for him. He sees the physical pain of the players but tries to support them by showing that they can be a big part of the sport.Some of these soldiers participated in the premier competitions of the League of Nations of the European Football Federation among teams formed from players with limb amputations.In October, the Ukrainian team took second place, defeating the national teams of Greece (2-1) and Belgium (1-0), and also shared points in goalless matches with the teams of Georgia and Israel.“I’m really proud to coach these people,” added Rzondkovsky. “I’m not only their coach. I’m their friend. We are joking a lot during the breaks. It’s a very good atmosphere here.“Thanks to football, they seem to come back to life after the war. In my opinion, rehabilitation through sport, through football, is the best, most effective rehabilitation that can exist.”There is plenty of humor and support among the amputees during the Thursday game that CNN watches.“It was harder on the frontline,” says 32-year-old Roman Lyndov, who plays as a goalkeeper at this game. He lost his left hand in February 2014 at the beginning of the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine, also known as Euromaidan, when something exploded near him.For Lyndov, spending evenings on the field is much better than lounging on the sofa. “This game is more about the character. We are here to win,” he says.Another player is 31-year-old veteran Olha Benda. The mother of two boys, Benda lost part of her left hand in 2017.She was the senior cook at the 72nd Mechanized Brigade. In 2017, with her unit, she was in positions in Avdiivka, eastern Ukraine.She was sleeping in her room when shelling started. When the first explosion happened, Benda fell out of bed. After the second explosion, she was stuck under the rubble and then passed out.There were about 10 Ukrainian soldiers at that location, but she was the only one who was seriously injured.It’s her first training session in Kyiv. Before this, she had been to Poland to watch women’s games and also train. She plans to join the Ukrainian women’s amputee soccer team, which is just being formed. She gets tired faster than the men but doesn’t stop playing, even when out of breath.“I don’t want to be last, I want to be on the same level as the men,” Beneda told CNN. “That’s why I don’t give up. I don’t want to sit in one place; I want to always be on the move and keep my body in good physical shape.“I need to set an example for my sons,” explains Beneda, adding that her nine-year-old son is waiting for her at home and keeps asking her when she is going to start playing soccer with him.Andriy, 42, is also at Thursday’s session. An infantryman, in charge of a rocket launcher, Andriy lost his left hand after being hit by a shell a few months ago in the Donetsk region.He recently was fitted with a prosthetic but is currently on sick leave and has medical boards ahead of him. In the meantime, he dreams about the possibility of peace.Malchevsky, who returned to the company where he had worked before the invasion as an electrical engineering analyst, says he plays not only for himself but also for his family.“I have to take care of myself. I don’t want to be pushed around in a wheelchair in five years. I don’t want to ruin the lives of my child, wife and parents,” he reflects."

        "title": "Liverpool’s quadruple dream comes to an end in FA Cup quarterfinal thriller against Manchester United",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Liverpool’s chances of a historic quadruple in Jürgen Klopp’s final season at the club are over after falling to a 4-3 extra time defeat against bitter rival Manchester United in a frenetic FA Cup quarterfinal.Goals from Scott McTominay, Antony, Marcus Rashford and Amad Diallo gave United the win in a topsy-turvy FA Cup classic at Old Trafford in Manchester.Liverpool, the reigning Carabao Cup champions after beating Chelsea last month, twice looked as though it was headed for victory but United rallied to find an equalizer in the closing minutes of regulation before scoring twice in extra time to nullify a Harvey Elliott goal.“The first 35 minutes I think was the best minutes from our season,” United manager Erik ten Hag told the ITV broadcast after the game. “We were really there, acting as a team. But then gaps in between the lines and you can’t allow this against Liverpool. Then they outplay you.“We had to change. We went into the risk, we went into one against one, and the players were wonderful - the mentality, the attitude was so great.”Klopp rued his side’s missed chances after the game as he saw the match slip through his fingers.“At 2-1 up we had so many chances to kill the game. Last pass not right, or in a rush in some moments. The rest is already history, if you want,” Klopp said after the game.“We were nearly there in normal time and nearly there in extra-time and then we lose the game, that’s alright. I cannot ask for much more. We have had a much more intense season so far, everybody knows that, you just have to count the games.Today was hard, very hard.”The game got off to a breathless start, with United twice forcing Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher – deputizing for the injured Alisson – into action in the early stages.Dominik Szoboszlai was denied by United ‘keeper Andre Onana inside the opening 10 minutes, but it was the home side that had the upper hand in the fast-paced start.United were rewarded for the early pressure and broke the deadlock through McTominay 10 minutes in, who poked home after Alejandro Garnacho’s shot was saved by Kelleher.Klopp’s side grew into the game though and began to cause United problems going forward as it went in search of an equalizer.Wataru Endo thought he had leveled things up in the 38th minute, but his goal was disallowed after Mohamed Salah was ruled to be marginally offside in the buildup.Liverpool did eventually find the breakthrough a few minutes later, albeit with a slice of luck. Argentinean midfielder Alexis Mac Allister was set up by Darwin Núñez and fired towards goal, with his shot taking a heavy deflection off Kobbie Mainoo that Onana was unable to keep out.Just three minutes later, Núñez was denied by a flailing Onana on the stroke of halftime but the ball dropped at the feet of Salah, who rifled home to complete a rapid turnaround on the stroke of halftime.Liverpool carried its positive momentum into the second half and continued to control proceedings at a breakneck pace.Onana saved efforts from Núñez twice while Mac Allister saw a free kick soar over the bar as Klopp’s team kept its foot on the gas pedal. United winger Antony, who came on as a substitute, dragged an effort wide in what was at that point a rare United venture forward.The visiting side continued to pile on the pressure and had the chance to put the game beyond doubt in the 80th minute but squandered a five-on-two counter-attack.Despite being in control for much of the game, Liverpool was made to pay for missing a host of chances 87 minutes in, when United sprung forward on the attack, with the ball working its way to Antony. The Brazilian swiveled and fired past Kelleher on his right foot to score only his second goal of the season and tie the game at 2-2.Liverpool almost responded immediately with Harvey Elliott striking the post at the other end, while Marcus Rashford missed a glorious chance to steal the win for United in the final minute of regulation.The two sides headed into a much more even extra time period, where another dose of fortune gave Liverpool the lead, as Elliott’s long-range strike was deflected off the boot of Christian Eriksen and flew into the bottom corner to send the visiting fans into raptures.In a game as hectic as this though, no lead was ever truly safe, as United proved in the second half of extra time. Rashford made up for missing a sitter, slotting home to level the score at 3-3 before substitute Amad Diallo spearheaded a counter-attack in the dying seconds of the game, eventually sweeping past Kelleher to give the Red Devils the win in an all-time FA Cup tie.Diallo received a second yellow card and was sent off after removing his shirt in celebration, but he will almost certainly be forgiven after his late-game heroics.United will take on English Championship side Coventry City in the semifinal, with the other tie seeing an all-Premier League clash between Manchester City and Chelsea, who beat Newcastle United and Leicester City respectively over the weekend."

        "title": "TPC Sawgrass 17th hole: Is this ‘watery grave’ the scariest shot in sports?",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Jack Nicklaus said players wanted to detonate a bomb under it, while Mark Calcavecchia compared it to a root canal appointment.Despite measuring a dainty 137 yards from tee to cup, the par-three 17th hole of the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass is as feared as it is revered.An island green encircled by a vast lake on all sides, but for a thin land bridge, the dreams of countless golfers fighting to clinch the PGA Tour’s flagship event – The Players Championship – have sunk into a watery grave alongside their ball.Since PGA Tour ShotLink tracking began in 2003, 925 balls have splashed into the lake at No. 17 during the tournament. Across the rest of the year, when amateurs take the plunge, up to 120,000 balls are claimed by its waters annually, Sawgrass’ head greenskeeper estimated in 2019.On the eve of the 50th edition of ‘the fifth major,’ golf’s biggest stars will head to bed knowing even one misstep at the penultimate hole could – at a tournament offering an unrivalled $25 million purse – cost them millions.Vying for position with legendary par-threes like the 12th at Augusta National or the 7th at Pebble Beach, the 17th at The Stadium Course is undoubtedly among golf’s most iconic holes – and yet its unmistakable style emerged almost inadvertently.Tasked by then-PGA Tour commissioner Deane Beman with turning flat, wooded North Florida swampland into a unique, spectator-friendly course worthy of the circuit’s premier tournament, course architect Pete Dye had his work cut out when construction began in 1978.It was a brief that quickly ate into the total build budget of between $7 million and $10 million dollars, then-project manager Vernon Kelly told National Club Golfer last month. A cost-saving solution emerged when it was discovered that the area around the 17th green could be excavated for sand, a valuable resource in shaping the rest of the course and the rolling slopes needed to give fans a good view of action.Yet the fix created a new set of problems. Dye, who had planned only for a small lake guarding the green, was left to ponder what to do with a now-cavernous pit surrounding the hole.The answer came from his wife Alice, who proposed they fill the crater with water. In 1982, the course would host The Players Championship for the first time – offering pros their first taste of the island green.It was a baptism of fire for many of the game’s biggest stars. Golf’s ‘Big Three’ – Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player – all missed the cut as Jerry Pate clinched a two-shot victory before launching Beman, Dye, and then himself into the waters of the 18th hole in celebration.It didn’t take long for the 17th hole to build an infamous reputation.In 1987, Jeff Sluman – locked in a sudden-death playoff with American compatriot Sandy Lyle – stood over a putt on the island green knowing a conversion from inside six feet would seal him his first PGA Tour title and $182,000.It was at that moment college student Hal Valdes dove into the lake and began paddling. Sluman backed off, and after a soaked Valdes was led away a minute later, he watched his putt come up agonizingly short. Lyle would take the championship on the subsequent hole.“It sure didn’t help me,” Sluman told reporters after. In a 2022 interview with Golf Digest, Valdes revealed his interruption was the result of a $500 dare from a friend.Yet Valdes is arguably not the hole’s most famous intruder. That title may well belong to one seagull who, in 1998, swooped down to pluck Brad Fabel’s ball from the green before taking flight and dropping it into the water.Fabel, who had sunk the very first 17th hole ace in Players Championship history in 1986, was permitted to put a new ball down where his former one had been, only to three-putt and leave with bogey.The island green would take center stage again at the tournament’s climax, as Florida-local Len Mattiace arrived at the 71st hole one shot off the lead as he chased a first PGA Tour crown. As his mother watched on from behind the ropes, the surrounding crowd watched in horror as Mattiace plopped one, then two, shots into the water.Finally leaving with a quintuple-bogey eight, Mattiace would slide to tied-fifth, four strokes behind champion Justin Leonard.More horror stories would follow. Sergio García had arrived at the penultimate hole tied for the lead with Tiger Woods in 2013, only to join Mattiace in finding the lake twice. Woods, who rarely needed any extra help to win, duly clinched his second Players title.It was a cruel twist of fate for the Spaniard, who had won the tournament five years earlier after his playoff opponent Paul Goydos had struck into the water.While it may not have cost Bob Tway the 2005 tournament, the American suffered the ignominy of posting the highest score ever carded on the 17th hole. Tway splashed four balls into the water before finally holing out with his 12th stroke, taking the existing unwanted record away from Robert Gamez, who shot 11 in 1990.Between 2003 and 2022, an average of 48.68 balls per tournament have found the lake. An eye-watering 50 balls went into the water during a wind-swept first round in 2007, contributing to a tournament-record high of 93 – dwarfing the low-record of 28 from 2014.It’s not all been doom and gloom though.Alex Smalley’s hole-in-one during the final round of last year’s tournament saw him join an elite group of 13 players to have made an ace on No. 17. After Hayden Buckley and Aaron Rai had achieved the feat earlier in the week, it marked the most hole-in-ones made at a Players event – after just three had been seen across over 7,400 tee shots between 2000 and 2016.The third ever ace was technically a ‘hole-in-three.’ In 1997, Fred Couples shrugged off the despair of finding the water with his tee shot by slam-dunking his subsequent effort into the cup for surely the most bizarre par of his career.Rickie Fowler has yet to ace the 17th, but emphatically put his stamp on the hole’s history in 2015 when he birdied it five times from six attempts – including three on the Sunday – on course to his biggest career victory in 2015. The American birdied No. 17 twice during a three-way playoff to see off Kevin Kisner and García.Matt Kuchar staked his claim for the greatest non-hole-in-one shot ever played on the hole in 2015 when, fighting to make the cut at the end of the second round, he lined up an awkward looking lie next to a bulkhead.Unable to swing right-handed due to his proximity to the water, Kuchar turned to face the opposite direction and scooped a stunning one-handed shot onto the green. However, a subsequent two-putt bogey would see him fail to make the weekend.Yet for many golf fans, there’s no debate as to the iconic shot holed at the 17th – after all, it was “better than most.”A blistering third round had seen Woods race into contention as he chased his first Players title at the 2001 tournament, yet an over-hit shot at the second-to-last hole looked set to puncture his momentum.Some 60-feet away from the cup at the back of the green, Woods sent a winding effort meandering across the grass. Stone-faced, Woods raised his putter in anticipation as NBC commentator Gary Koch repeated his now-immortalized call: “Better than most.”The birdie would prove crucial as Woods went on to clinch the trophy by a single stroke ahead of Vijay Singh.Though brilliant shots have been a hallmark of the 15-time major champion’s career since, that putt, his emphatic celebration and Koch’s call remain one of Woods’ defining moments."

        "text": "Her face might have been bloodied and battered, but ski jumper Slje Opseth couldn’t stop smiling as reality dawned on her that she’d just set a new women’s world record.After landing a 230.5 meter jump at a competition in Vikersund, Norway, an emotional Opseth put her head in her hands after her landmark jump on Sunday.The previous record was set at the same location last year, with Ema Klinec of Slovenia jumping 226 meters.“Wow, what did just happen? World record,” Norwegian Opseth wrote on Instagram later on Sunday, before thanking everyone involved in her record attempt.“Overwhelmed by all messages, but could [have] never done this alone,” added the 34-year-old ski jumper.Opseth’s day had started in the worst possible way after she had fallen on landing when jumping 236 meters in the trial run, according to organizers, with the incident leaving the ski-jumper with cuts to her face.The seven-time World Cup winner managed to recover, though, and broke the world record with her final attempt.“Long day and a little lost for words,” Opseth wrote on her Instagram story, with a picture of her face covered in plasters.“Ps. Medical check at the hospital tonight went well for those who wondered.”The new world record holder first fell in love with the sport in 2010 after attempting her first jump during a New Year’s celebration. Opseth went on to make her World Cup debut just five years later, and has represented Norway at two Winter Olympic Games, in 2018 and 2022.On Sunday, the 24-year-old Opseth finished the first ever Women’s Ski Flying World Cup in second, behind Norwegian teammate Eirin Maria Kvandal. Former world-record holder Klinec was in third."

        "text": "More than a dozen current and former collegiate female athletes filed a lawsuit with a US District Court in Georgia on Thursday, alleging that the NCAA “serially violated Title IX in 2022 by purposefully adopting and amending policies” to allow transgender swimmer Lia Thomas to compete with the UPenn women’s swim team during NCAA competitions.Thomas became the first transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title after winning the women’s 500-yard freestyle event in March 2022, as CNN previously reported.The lawsuit, filed against the NCAA and the University System of Georgia, who hosted the 2022 NCAA championships at Georgia Tech, claims the defendants violated Title IX.The athletes also allege the NCAA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “by treating women unequally in comparison to men, depriving women of competitive opportunities equal to those afforded men, and violating women’s right to bodily privacy.”The lawsuit seeks to have a judge declare that the NCAA violated Title IX and the Fourteenth Amendment and to keep the NCAA from “enforcing or implementing” its transgender eligibility rules.The plaintiffs also seek a ruling, requiring the NCAA to invalidate and revise all records and titles that were based on the results of competitions that allowed transgender athletes to participate.The athletes say in the lawsuit they filed it “to secure for future generations of women the promise of Title IX that is being denied them and other college women” by the NCAA.“College sports are the premier stage for women’s sports in America, and while the NCAA does not comment on pending litigation, the Association and its members will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women’s sports and ensure fair competition in all NCAA championships,” the NCAA said in a statement.The University System of Georgia declined to comment on pending litigation."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "The BNP Paribas Open – commonly referred to as Indian Wells – was all abuzz on Thursday after a swarm of bees caused a lengthy delay to a quarterfinal matchup between Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev.The scores were level at 1-1 in the first set when Alcaraz started swatting at the air. At first, it wasn’t quite clear what was happening, but then chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani was forced to pause proceedings as more bees arrived on the court in California.World No. 2 Alcaraz was seen making a beeline for the locker room before the umpire told the crowd that there was a “bee invasion.” Video appeared to show Lahyani being stung on the head shortly after his announcement.After attempts to restart the match were temporarily squandered by the presence of yet more bees, play eventually got underway after a one hour and 48 minute delay, with Alcaraz eventually winning 6-3 6-1.“For sure, it is the most unusual match I have ever played in my career,” the Spanaird told reporters. “I’ve never experienced something like that. I’ve never seen something like that.“I think I will remember that match because of that. I think everybody will remember this situation, and we found it a funny thing, that’s for sure.”But while Alcaraz won the match, it was beekeeper Lance Davis who truly saved the day.After players retreated to the locker room, Davis rushed to the court to corral the flying insects which had begun swarming on one of the overhead cameras on court.Organizers were able to maneuver the camera towards the stands where the bees were met by Davis and his vacuum.The beekeeper transferred the insects into a cage to be transported away from the stadium and into one of his personal hives, according to ATPTour.com.“This time of year is swarming season, so they go everywhere,” Davis told ATPTour.com. “And I’m just happy to be there for them, so they could not have any incidents.”Donning a fetching pair of all-black ski sunglasses, the president of ‘Killer Bee Live Removal’ became an instant hit on social media as he high-fived spectators and posed for selfies during his mission to save the match.“Not all heroes wear capes,” Alcaraz wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, responding to a video of Davis in action.Davis, who told ATPTour.com that he doesn’t have social media on his phone, also went viral for his fearless approach to the problem.US actor Ben Stiller was one of many impressed with his work, writing on X: “Bee Invasion Guy is very cool. Fearless.”After his somewhat unusual win, Alcaraz will now face Jannik Sinner in the semifinals of the tournament.If nothing else, he’ll hope he can just get on with his tennis without being mobbed by another invasion of bees.“I’m not going to lie, I’m a little bit afraid of the bees,” the two-time grand slam winner admitted after his win."

        "title": "‘Better together:’ How friendship and faith helped guide these two US marathon runners to Paris 2024",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "In many ways, Conner Mantz and Clayton Young are typical friends.They have known each other for years, live just a short drive from each other in Utah and spend a lot of time together. Mantz and his wife have occasionally stepped in for baby-sitting duties and Young once helped paint his friend’s house.But this friendship has an added level of complexity – Mantz and Young are two of the best marathon runners in the US and race against one another.After meeting at college in 2017, the duo have been on a near-seven-year mission to represent their country at the Olympic Games.During an emotional Olympic trials race in February, they worked together to make that ambition a reality.The pair finished first and second at the Florida event to stamp their tickets to Paris 2024. Young, who had looked the fresher of the two on the final stretch, seemingly gave up his lead to Mantz as the pair were separated by just one second, both achieving a life-long dream in the process.“Not a day goes by when I’m not having this conversation about the Olympics and the Olympic trials,” Young, 30, tells CNN Sport in a joint-interview with Mantz.“There’s this wave of emotion that comes over you and you’re like, ‘Oh yeah, that’s right. I did make the Olympic team. I’m an Olympian.’”Mantz says the achievement has taken a while to settle in but has slowly become more “normal” now that the training partners have started their preparations for Paris 2024.“It’s kind of unbelievable because you never know who’s going to be good,” the 27-year-old Mantz, who is three years younger than his friend, tells CNN Sport when reflecting on what they achieved at the Olympic trials.“Yes, we were the number one and number two seeds heading into the [race], but in athletics, everything is a lot more complicated than that. You can be the number one seed and you not make the final [selection].“So it was just special that it happened together. We’ve trained together for almost seven years and we’ve actually had our goals and dreams accomplished.”The pair estimate they’ve run well over 10,000 miles together over the years, since meeting at Brigham Young University (BYU) in 2017.Both agree that experiencing that same journey has offered each of them a deeper level of support, be it on a physical or mental level.“We’re able to learn from one another when we’re not running, and then when we are running, we’re able to push each other,” says Mantz, whose personal best for the marathon is two hours, seven minutes and 47 seconds.Young agrees, adding: “I think about standing on the starting line in Paris. I’m going to be standing next to [Mantz] again and just having the confidence that I’ve trained with one of the best athletes in the world, will give me a lot of confidence knowing that I belong.“If I can stick with him in practice, I can stick with him, hopefully, in Paris. That gives me a lot of confidence.”Make no mistake, though, both these men are fiercely competitive and are aware there might come a time where they have to put their friendship aside in order to claim personal glory – and for their country.If they have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship over almost seven years of training together, the two friends are honest enough to admit the occasional tension during workouts.“It’s definitely a dance that we have to play, and we just have to keep reminding ourselves that we’re better together,” says Young, who boasts a marathon personal best of two hours and eight minutes.“We are very competitive and we want to beat each other at the end of the day. But, ultimately, I have decided to fully embrace this relationship and I know that I will just be better because of it.”As well as a love for running, both men also share a joint faith, which they credit for helping them achieve so much in track and field.Both are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints – the largest Mormon denomination – and each served missions before meeting at college.Mantz served a mission in Ghana, while Young spent two years on a mission in North Carolina. The latter says his faith has helped ease the “daunting” pressures of racing on a global stage.“If my only identity is as a runner or making this Olympic team, it can be very debilitating,” he says, with Mantz nodding along in agreement.“Through our canonized faith, we’ve realized that we’re more than just a couple of runners, we’re more than just professional athletes. We’re husbands, I’m a father, and we’re ultimately sons of God.“It definitely has contributed to our running because that eternal perspective is really what grounds us. Racing is important and making an Olympic team is obviously a once in a lifetime thing, but there is more to this life than running.”With Paris 2024 fast approaching, both men are building up their preparations ahead of this year’s Olympics.Young is excited to compete at the upcoming NYC Half on March 17, a half-marathon event organized by New York Road Runners.More than 25,000 runners participate in the event, which goes from Brooklyn to Manhattan and ends in Central Park, with the race the only time other than New Year’s Eve that Times Square is closed to traffic.It will be another opportunity for Young to compete with other elite athletes before he races for medals at the Olympic Games.Mantz, meanwhile, has picked up a minor injury in recent days and had to drop out of the half-marathon race. The setback is not expected to impact his participation at Paris 2024 though.Neither is afraid to admit that a podium place in Paris is the goal, but both are acutely aware of how unpredictable an Olympic marathon can be.“I’d be lying if I said that [Young] and I don’t have it in the back of our minds that we’re wanting to go and get a medal. Whether that’s public or not, it shouldn’t matter,” Mantz says.Young agrees, saying: “I’m going to put myself in the best position possible and see what happens.”The 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games are set to begin on July 26, with the men’s marathon scheduled for August 10."

        "text": "The Long Beach State Beach men’s basketball team is dancing into March Madness, and it is being led by a coach who was informed last week that the university had decided to let him go after 17 seasons at the helm of the program.A week ago, the Beach were mired in a five-game losing streak to end the regular season as their Cinderella hopes seemed to be circling the drain. So it was not a major shock when the university announced on Monday that it would be parting ways with longtime head coach Dan Monson at the conclusion of the season.As almost an afterthought in that announcement, Long Beach State added that Monson and director of athletics Bobby Smitheran mutually agreed that Monson would remain as coach to see the Beach through their postseason.Then, Long Beach State caught fire at the Big West Conference Tournament in Henderson, Nevada. The Beach defeated UC Riverside, UC Irvine and UC Davis in consecutive days to claim the conference championship Saturday and punch a ticket to the NCAA men’s basketball tournament.After winning the Big West Championship, Monson said that this run wouldn’t be the end of his coaching career.“I don’t think this is my last,” Monson told game broadcaster ESPN. “I love coaching, I love teams. I need a new challenge. It’s life, on to the next chapter.”This will be the Beach’s first trip to the big dance since 2012, and the second appearance in Monson’s 17-year tenure with the school.Long Beach State will learn its March Madness fate Sunday evening when the NCAA Tournament bracket is revealed."

        "text": "Days after being sued for allegedly trying to extort Dak Prescott for $100 million, a woman and her attorneys have filed a civil complaint against the Dallas Cowboys quarterback alleging he sexually assaulted her in 2017.According to the civil complaint filed on Thursday and obtained by CNN, the woman and her attorneys allege Prescott sexually assaulted her on or about February 2, 2017. Dallas police confirmed to CNN it received a report of a sexual assault on Tuesday.The woman alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Prescott while the two traveled in a black SUV towards a Dallas-area strip club. According to the complaint, Prescott allegedly exposed himself to the woman, and when she refused the advances, he proceeded to use physical force and raped her.Prescott’s attorney Levi McCathern denied the allegations against the Cowboys quarterback, saying the lawsuit was an attempt at an “illegal shakedown.”“The timing is important here,” McCathern said in a statement to CNN on Thursday. “The extortion investigation began first. She didn’t go to any law enforcement for over 7 years. But once they (attorneys and the accuser) become aware that the $100,000,000 extortion plot has failed and that they are the subject of a criminal investigation they, for the first time, file a police report in a different jurisdiction[.]”On Monday, Prescott filed a lawsuit alleging a woman was trying to extort $100 million from him. In the 11-page lawsuit filed in Collin County, Prescott’s attorney claims lawyers for the woman sent an email in January to a third party at the college Prescott attended, Mississippi State University, addressed to the football player.It stated she would not press any criminal charges against Prescott regarding an alleged February 2017 sexual assault in exchange for compensation.Meanwhile, police in Prosper, Texas have launched an investigation, saying they were looking into Prescott’s extortion claim, confirming to CNN they met with one of his attorneys.CNN has reached out to the NFL and the Cowboys but did not immediately hear back."

        "title": "Mo Salah sets Liverpool goalscoring record in team’s stunning 11-2 aggregate victory over Sparta Prague",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "As bad days at the office go, it’s unlikely Sparta Prague will have endured many worse than on Thursday.Already trailing 5-1 after last week’s Europa League round-of-16 first leg, Sparta found itself 9-1 down on aggregate after only 15 minutes at Anfield as Liverpool went on an early rampage with goals from Darwin Nuñez, Bobby Clark, Mo Salah and Cody Gakpo.Things did get slightly better for Sparta – albeit very briefly – as Veljko Birmančević reduced the aggregate deficit to seven goals when he scored just before half-time to make it 4-1 on the night.However, a rampant Liverpool wasn’t done yet, as goals from Gakpo and Dominik Szoboszlai rounded out a 6-1 win on the night and an 11-2 drubbing on aggregate in one of the most one-sided ties you are ever likely to see in a European competition.“The boys started the game incredibly well,” Klopp told reporters after the game. “We were really, really after them, at them – however you want to call it – and scored wonderful goals.“Four-nil after 14 minutes is really strange, and from that moment on, it became a strange game because how can you now stay greedy and these kinds of things. In that moment, probably everybody thought: ‘OK, we have other games to come,’ stuff like this.”Salah’s goal was his 20th in all competitions this season, marking the first time in Liverpool’s history that a player has reached that landmark for seven consecutive seasons.Klopp said that statistic is “not really surprising” because Salah, who was making his first start since January 1 due to injury, is “an outstanding player.”“I’ve worked seven years together with him, so one problem we never had was consistency,” Klopp said. “Mo is just delivering and delivering and delivering, his desire doesn’t stop. His quality is anyway there, but then his desire to score just doesn’t stop.“He improved in so many aspects since he started here. He will not stop, so I’m less surprised than maybe some others. I thought it had already happened, to be honest, in this season, but he was injured for a while and that’s why he couldn’t do it [earlier]. Otherwise, it would have happened in January or February.“So, great, very good and, as I said, great to have him back.”Klopp, who is leaving Liverpool at the end of the season after nine years at the club, was asked whether he “felt sorry for Sparta” during the hammering.“There is a quality difference,” he replied, revealing that he’d spoken to Sparta’s manager, Brian Priske, after the game. “That was clear before the game and it is always like this: if the team with the higher quality shows a good attitude, which we did, then it will be tricky. Where is the chance?“A long time in my life, I obviously worked for a smaller club – not that Sparta are a small club – but I worked in Germany for a smaller club with Mainz. You can win games, but you need a little bit of help from the opponent – we didn’t give any help [tonight].“The boys showed a top, top, top attitude and so it was difficult and then we all know how these things can go.”"

        "title": "Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez roll back the years to lead Inter Miami past Nashville SC and into Champions Cup quarterfinals",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez rolled back the years once again to guide Inter Miami to a 3-1 win over Nashville SC in the second leg of their Champions Cup round of 16 tie, reaching the quarterfinals 5-3 on aggregate.The former Barcelona teammates linked up inside the opening eight minutes to give Miami the lead, still displaying a remarkable understanding for each other’s games that has evidently not waned over the years.Suárez dummied the ball and allowed it to run through to Messi, before spinning into the box and receiving a return pass from the Argentine to slot the ball past Nashville goalkeeper Joe Willis.There was another South American connection for Miami’s second, but this time Paraguayan Diego Gómez turned provider for Messi, slaloming into the Nashville penalty area before setting up the World Cup winner to double the team’s lead.Miami sealed its place in the quarterfinals less than 20 minutes into the second half when Robert Taylor headed home from Suárez’s pinpoint cross into the penalty area, before Sam Surridge got a late consolation goal for Nashville.“We spent many years playing together in Barcelona and it is nice to be back together,” Suárez said of his connection with Messi, per ESPN.“We know each other too well, we almost always know where the other is positioned, almost by heart, and we try to transfer that for the benefit of Inter Miami.“We are enjoying this possibility of playing together again, enjoying a football that is new for me and trying to make people enjoy it. We have made a lot of sacrifice over the last 20 years and we deserve to enjoy these last few years of our career a little.”However, it wasn’t all good news for Miami after Messi was forced off with an injury in the second half, though he didn’t appear to be struggling with a knock.“I don’t want to take any risks, but I imagine that he won’t be available for Saturday’s game,” head coach Gerardo Martino said, per ESPN. “That’s the only thing I can say about it now. We’ll have some tests soon and we’ll see how he feels.“Leo has a muscle overload in his right leg. We don’t want to take any kind of risk with him. We tried to see if he could last a little longer after half-time, but it was bothering him, so we preferred to take him out the game.“We knew when the season started that Messi was not going to play all games. If he’s not playing or we have to replace him, for me, it’s not just missing out any other player, he’s the best player of all time.”Miami will face either Monterrey or Cincinnati in the quarterfinals of the Champions Cup – the UEFA Champions League equivalent for clubs playing in North America, Central America and the Caribbean – with the first leg taking place on April 2."

        "title": "‘When I see Russian athletes … I see every city destroyed,’ says Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "At some point last year, Yaroslava Mahuchikh vowed to stop reading the news before competitions, so distressing did she find the stories and images of bloodshed in her native Ukraine.One of the world’s top high jumpers, Mahuchikh knew that absolute concentration was required to perfectly execute her run-up, take-off and back-arching leap, but still her mind would gravitate towards the distressing situation thousands of miles away back home.Perhaps that’s only natural when your country is at war and fresh missile attacks are being launched on a regular basis – some even directed at blocks in your hometown.“It’s challenging for me to compete after reading the news of rockets sent to civilians,” Mahuchikh tells CNN Sport. “I’m thinking about how many people died, how many peoples’ houses were destroyed. It’s difficult.”That strategy – of trying to shut out Russia’s invasion of Ukraine before she competes – proved effective last year. Mahuchikh won her first world championship title in August, then successfully defended her Diamond League Final victory in September.Understandably, her confidence is now high for the months ahead. That includes the Millrose Games in New York this weekend, the world indoor championships in Glasgow in March and then the Paris Olympics in July and August.She’s unsure if she will return to Ukraine in that time having moved between various training bases around Europe for most of the past two years. Because of the war, itinerancy has become a common theme in her life.“I live in a suitcase, really,” says Mahuchikh, “because with traveling, we don’t have a hometown.”Her family – her mother and sister – have sometimes joined the 22-year-old while she is on the road, but her father, like many Ukrainians, has stayed at home in Dnipro. That’s often a source of anxiety for Mahuchikh, especially when Russian attacks target the eastern city.“My father, he said that, unfortunately, for a lot of people, it’s life right now, we live in this way,” she explains.“And they continue their life. My father sometimes says, ‘Oh, you know, if the rockets come, it’s okay, it’s my life, maybe it’s God saying that it’s finished.’ And I say, ‘Oh my gosh, father, please – go to the basement.’”Dnipro has absorbed several deadly missile attacks throughout the invasion, with the Russian military targeting apartment blocks and medical facilities in the city.In August last year, Ukraine’s War Crimes Department in the Prosecutor General’s Office said that approximately 10,749 civilians had been killed during the war and 15,599 wounded.Yet even as fighting rages on, Mahuchikh still longs for the familiarity of being back home with her family and friends.“If I was not an athlete at international level, I think I would be in Ukraine,” she says. “But I have some goals and I’m competing for my country. I represent Ukraine at competitions; it’s my goal and it’s my mission, I think.”Russia’s invasion has invigorated Mahuchikh’s sense of national pride. She wore blue and yellow eye shadow – the colors of the Ukrainian flag – at last year’s world championships and is supporting fundraising efforts to send wheelchairs to disabled orphans in Ukraine.She also hopes that competing at high-profile events and winning gold medals will provide her with a platform from which to highlight her country’s plight.“I feel that I am an ambassador of Ukraine and I have this possibility to involve a lot of people in this problem that Ukrainian people now have,” says Mahuchikh.“A lot of families are under rocket attack; a lot of children, unfortunately, lost their parents or parents lost their children. It’s so sad, and it’s so sad that a lot of athletes and coaches died in this war. But I want to help my country. It’s the main goal.”According to Vadim Guttsait, Ukraine’s sports minister and president of its National Olympic Committee (NOC), more than 400 Ukrainian athletes have been killed since the start of the war.This year’s Olympics, Mahuchikh believes, will enable Ukrainian athletes to promote a message of peace, though perhaps inevitably, the Games have also become entwined in geopolitics.In particular, the question of whether athletes from Russia and Belarus, a key military launchpad during the war in Ukraine, will be able to compete has become a flashpoint.In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that athletes from those two countries will be able to take part as neutrals in Paris, so long as they meet certain eligibility criteria.For example, only individual athletes, rather than teams, will be included in the Games, and athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to their country’s military services will be ineligible.However, international federations have the first say on whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can qualify for the Olympics. World Athletics, the governing body of track and field, has excluded Russian and Belarusians from events “for the foreseeable future,” meaning they will be unable to compete in track and field events in Paris as things stand.It’s a contentious topic: some, like the IOC’s executive board, believe that individual athletes shouldn’t be stopped from competing on the basis of their passport, while others, namely a campaign group representing Ukrainian athletes, argue that Russian participation of any kind only strengthens the country’s “propaganda machine.”Mahuchikh welcomes World Athletics’ stance, believing that neutral flags are an ineffective way of concealing an athlete’s national identity.“When I see Russian athletes … I see every city destroyed, every life that was destroyed by Russian people, by the Russian Federation,” she says, adding that she would find it “difficult” to compete against athletes from Russia and Belarus.Last month, more than 200 sportspeople from Ukraine wrote a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron, urging Russians and Belarusians to be banned from competing at the Games.However, neither local organizers nor the French government have jurisdiction over who qualifies for the Olympics, and Paris 2024 organizers have underlined that this responsibility lies with the IOC and international federations.Guttsait has previously suggested that Ukraine could boycott the Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete, though a final decision is yet to be made.Mahuchikh is against such a move, instead believing that the Olympics should represent “peace in all the world.” A bronze medalist in Tokyo three years ago, she is also one of Ukraine’s biggest stars in Paris, aiming to win what would be her country’s first gold medal in the high jump.“Every athlete wants to compete, every athlete wants to win the gold medal,” says Mahuchikh. “Of course, I have goals for winning, and I want to have this medal in my sports career.”She has tweaked her technique ahead of the upcoming indoor season, shortening her run-up to compensate for her increased speed as she approaches the bar. Having made her season debut in Cottbus, Germany, last weekend – finishing first after clearing a world-leading height of two meters and four centimeters (about 6.69 feet) – the new technique will be put to the test again at the Millrose Games.This is where Mahuchikh’s immediate focus lies, but in the long term, she has loftier ambitions for her career – namely Stefka Kostadinova’s world record of two meters and nine centimeters (about 6.86 feet).The Bulgarian’s mark has stood since 1987, making it one of the longest-standing world records in track and field. Mahuchikh has watched the likes of Karsten Warholm and Mondo Duplantis – both, like her, sponsored by Puma – set records in the 400-meter hurdles and the pole vault respectively, and now she hopes to join the club.“I believe that one day I will jump 2.10,” she says. “I want to be part of this family of world record holders.”"
