        "category": "us",
        "text": "Gov. Ron DeSantis is dispatching 140 state troopers throughout Florida, including Miami Beach, in an effort to curb outbreaks of spring break violence.The move comes after two deadly shootings in Miami Beach during spring break last year led to a state of emergency and a midnight curfew in the popular destination for vacationing college students. More than 40 troopers will be deployed in MIami Beach, according to the city’s mayor.“We at the state level stand ready to help our local communities maintain order,” DeSantis said Tuesday.“We don’t welcome mayhem,” DeSantis said. “The state has a lot going on, it’s a fun place to be at… we want to see people do that, but we also are going to insist that people respect the law.”DeSantis said the troopers will assist 17 law enforcement agencies, and a rapid-response team of 24 troopers will be on standby in Bay, Volusia, Broward and Miami-Dade counties.Troopers will assist with crowd control, DUI checkpoints, license plate readers and directing traffic, the governor told reporters Tuesday.The Miami City Commission voted last week on a series of measures to enhance security during the month of March, including security checkpoints at beach entrances, license plate readers at certain locations, more DUI inspections, and a greater presence of law enforcement from Miami and other jurisdictions.“We are going to see 45 Florida Troopers out on our streets the next couple of weeks,” Miami Beach Mayor Steven Meiner said.The city even put spring breakers on notice with a video on YouTube entitled, “Miami Beach Is Breaking Up With Spring Break.”A midnight curfew was put in place last year, as well as in 2022 after two shootings left five people injured."

        "category": "us",
        "text": "A woman who accused Michigan State University’s then-head football coach Mel Tucker of sexual harassment intends to sue him, the school and others for tens of millions of dollars in damages, according to new legal filings.Rape survivor and advocate Brenda Tracy is set to sue Tucker, MSU, its board of trustees and a dozen other unnamed people for $75 million over allegations that Tucker sexually harassed her, that the school failed to properly investigate her claims of Tucker’s misbehavior, and that “a yet-to-be identified MSU affiliated party” inappropriately leaked her identity to the news media, according to a notice of intent to sue filed in a Michigan court on Wednesday.Karen Truszkowski, Tracy’s attorney, declined to comment when reached by CNN on Wednesday.CNN has sought comment from Tucker’s attorney and MSU.Tracy filed a complaint with MSU’s Title IX office in December 2022 alleging Tucker made sexual comments and masturbated during an April 2022 phone call with her, according to USA Today, which broke the story last September.“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” Tracy told USA Today at the time. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”In Wednesday’s filings, Tracy alleges that after making MSU aware of the phone call in late 2022, MSU investigated her claims and assured her of confidentiality. Tracy also claims that “a yet-to-be identified MSU affiliated party” leaked her name to the press, and as a result she and her family were threatened, and that “those threats are ongoing and continue to the present,” the court papers state.MSU fired Tucker on September 27, weeks after USA Today reported he was under investigation.“While I am saddened by Ms. Tracy’s disclosure of the sensitive nature of this call, let me be perfectly clear – it was an entirely mutual, private event between two adults living at opposite ends of the country,” Tucker said in a statement that CNN obtained on September 11.Tracy intends to file two suits against Tucker, MSU and the other parties – one under her name for $50 million, and a second under her non-profit “Set The Expectation” for $25 million, according to the court papers. Those papers say she has the potential to sue on more than 20 different claims, including intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of duty of confidentiality.Tracy started “Set The Expectation,” through which she speaks to athletes about sexual violence, according to her website. Tracy was raped in 1998 by four college football players, leading to her advocacy.She served as an honorary captain for Michigan State’s spring football game in 2022, and the team posted a photo of Instagram of Tucker and Tracy together.In his statement last September, Tucker said he helped bring Tracy to campus for a presentation in 2021 because she supported her sexual misconduct prevention mission. He said they developed a friendship that grew into an intimate relationship, which he said involved calls including the one in April 2022.Tucker, a longtime coach in college and the NFL, became Michigan State’s head coach in 2020. In his second season, the team went 11-2 and he signed a 10-year, $95 million contract that made him one of the highest-paid coaches in college football. The team went 5-7 in 2022, and Tucker coached only the first two games of 2023 before he was suspended and then fired amid the harassment allegations."

        "category": "us",
        "text": "Costco locked in $1.50 hot dog-soda loyalists. Now, it’s chasing a different clientele: precious metal investors and collectors.Costco recently started selling silver coins for the first time, finance chief Richard Galanti told CNN.The company is selling 25-count tubes of 1 oz. Canada Maple Leaf Silver Coins online for $675. The front of the coins features a maple leaf, and King Charles III is on the back. The coins are non-refundable, and members can purchase a maximum of five.Costco is trying to replicate its recent success with gold bars. It began selling $2,000 gold bars online in September and sold more than $100 million worth of the bars last quarter.But Costco’s move is more about marketing than just about increasing sales. After all, not many people are actually stashing away gold bars in their homes.It’s selling precious metals to try to reinforce its “treasure hunt” brand image where it peppers its stores with unexpected, limited-time items to keep shoppers coming back.“We try to create an attitude that, if you see it, you ought to buy it because chances are it ain’t going to be there next time,” Costco’s founder once said. “That’s the treasure-hunt aspect. We constantly buy that stuff and intentionally run out of it from time to time.”Costco is also selling precious metals as they become more valuable. Gold prices have notched record highs this week. Silver futures are up 21% in the past year.Precious metal prices have gone up because investors are betting that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the back half of the year.Gold and silver are considered to be one of the most resilient investments. When interest rates fall, holding income-paying assets (like bonds) becomes less appealing than owning the precious metals. When interest rates are low, falling or — as in this case — expected to fall, demand for Treasury bonds ebbs, and precious metals, which don’t pay out any interest, become relatively more attractive.Some investors also believe them to be a hedge against inflation, wagering that they will hold their value even if it begins to surge, even though metals face price fluctuations like any other commodity.Costco’s success in selling the metals comes as the company continues to report strong profits from the pandemic in 2020, when customers rushed to stores to load up on groceries and household staples. Millions of first-time customers signed up for club memberships during the pandemic and have held on to them, pushing Costco’s member rolls to all-time highs.Shares of Costco (COST) have rallied 60% over the past year.Costco reported quarterly earnings Thursday. The company’s sales at stores open for at least one year increased 5.6%, but fell short of analyst forecasts.Costco said inflation was roughly flat during the quarter, which allowed it to reduce prices on some items.Galanti told analysts on a call Thursday that Costco cut reading glasses, for example, from $18.99 to $16.99 and cut a 48-count of batteries from $17.99 to $15.99."

        "title": "Biden projects a vision of strength that’s been missing from his presidency but will be needed in 2024 campaign",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "This version of Joe Biden could beat Donald Trump.At the State of the Union address on Thursday night, the 81-year-old president set out to defuse his biggest liability: deep-seated fears among millions of Americans that he’s too old to serve a second term.There is nothing worse for a president than looking weak. So every word, gesture, joke and admonition of Biden’s appearance was geared toward the goal of making him look strong.And in the most important moment of the 2024 election campaign so far, Biden appeared to succeed. He projected vigor and forcefulness. His voice, which has seemed reedy at times, was sonorant. He was quick off the mark as he goaded heckling Republicans, who again walked into his trap by showcasing their extremism to millions of viewers. Biden was a trenchant master of the chamber of the House of Representatives, effectively wielding the theatrics of the presidency and commanding an hour of unfiltered primetime television.At times, Biden reanimated the scrappy, twinkle-eyed, blue-collar street politician that has characterized his public image for decades — for instance, when he used the word “illegal” instead of the more politically correct term “undocumented migrant.”Taking aim at another of his own weaknesses — over the border crisis — Biden attacked the GOP for sabotaging a bipartisan border bill that contained many of the policies that Republicans had been advocating for years, apparently because Trump wanted to deprive him of an election year win. The president pointed out that many Republicans had originally supported the measure, and he mockingly reacted to their boos by saying: “You don’t think so — you don’t like that bill, huh?”Not for the first time in the speech, Biden appeared to be speaking directly to Trump, potentially watching at home in Florida, while trying to get under his skin. “If my predecessor is watching, instead of playing politics to pressure members of Congress to block the bill, join me in telling the Congress to pass it. We can do it together.”And Biden slammed Republicans for forgetting the trauma of the January 6, 2021, mob attack on the US Capitol by the former president’s supporters. “My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth of January 6. I will not do that,” Biden said. “Remember your oath of office — to defend against all threats foreign and domestic.” The president’s intention appeared to be to remind voters of the extremes of the Trump years at a time when polls suggest growing nostalgia for his presidency among some voters.Such an energetic performance from Biden has been in far less evidence as he’s perceptibly aged and been weighed down by the burdens of office. If he is to overcome the kind of low approval ratings that typically doom first-term presidents, he will have to emulate this performance over and over in the coming months.It is unusual for a president to spend so much time calling out his electoral opponent in an annual address. Biden repeatedly took shots at Trump – whom he referred to only as “my predecessor.” In that sense, this year’s State of the Union represented one of the most overt examples of a president delivering a campaign-style speech from the podium in the House, as Democrats chanted “four more years.”Trump has for years lampooned Biden as old, tired, doddering and weak, often with cruel impersonations at his campaign rallies. Any misstep or senior moment from the president on Thursday night would have immediately gone viral and had the damaging effect of confirming what majorities in polls think — that Biden is too old to be running for reelection.Alabama Sen. Katie Britt may have hoped for a less robust performance by the president since her Republican response to his speech included the pre-written line, “Right now, our commander in chief is not in command. The free world deserves better than a dithering and diminished leader.”House Speaker Mike Johnson took a similar approach as he accused Biden of behaving in a hyperpartisan manner.“President Biden is clearly not on his A-game and I think that’s a charitable way to describe it. I thought tonight he was overly emotional. I thought he shouted at the audience. I thought so much of that was unnecessary,” Johnson said.Of course, Republicans would have faulted any version of Biden that showed up on Thursday. Had he lacked energy, they’d have said he was too old. Since he put on a strong performance, they accused him of shouting.Not only did the president seek to project strength, he also sought to redefine the concept of strong leadership in his favor. He suggested that while Trump projects a strongman’s persona, he’s really most interested in genuflecting to dictators and autocrats.Biden started his speech with a strident demand for the House to lift its hold on his $60 billion arms package for Ukraine, which Trump opposes, portraying it as vital to continued American strength in the world.He contrasted Trump with former Republican President Ronald Reagan’s thundering call on Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down” the Berlin Wall. “My predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin, quote, ‘Do whatever the Hell you want,’” Biden said, drawing boos from Democrats on the House floor. “That’s a quote. A former president actually said that bowing down to a Russian leader. I think it’s outrageous, it’s dangerous and it’s unacceptable.”“We will not bow down. I will not bow down,” Biden said. “History is watching.” Biden also accused Trump of going soft on President Xi Jinping’s China, saying he had taken steps to bolster regional alliances to meet its threat and to protect US technology from being used in the country. “For all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that.”While Biden was hale and lively in delivering his speech, it’s tough to know in the moment how it will affect voters agonizing over their vote and even wavering Democrats whom the president badly needs to show up in large numbers in November. And his political position is so perilous that no one speech can guarantee his reelection. The months to come will have multiple unpredictable events that could sway the result.Some Republicans faulted the president’s delivery and said he mistook loudness for strength. Former President George W. Bush’s ex-spokesman Ari Fleischer mused on X, for instance, that someone had told Biden to show energy but that he instead came across as “weirdly amped up” and was “bizarrely fast” in his delivery.Other Republicans complained that Biden had polarized a great state occasion. “Maybe that was supposed to be the Democratic Convention speech,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas told CNN. “It was divisive. It was an attack ad against Republicans.”The president’s use of the annual speech to the nation to repeatedly attack his 2024 opponent, if not by name, was indeed a political risk in that it could have offended some swing voters. But it also made the most of what may be Biden’s most potent political platform of the year.And it’s rich for Republicans to complain about politicizing the State of the Union. Trump presented the Medal of Freedom to late conservative radio icon Rush Limbaugh one year. And he used the White House, which belongs to all Americans regardless of political party, as the backdrop for his Republican National Convention speech in the pandemic year of 2020.The profound national crossroads that the 2024 election represents – between Biden’s traditional, American global leadership and Trump’s populist “America First” nationalism – has rarely come across as stark as Biden laid it out during his opening remarks on Ukraine. On Friday, Trump is set to welcome a European autocrat, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, to his resort at Mar-a-Lago. Orban’s suppression of democracy, opposition figures, the legal system and the press looks a lot like the second term of “retribution” that Trump is promising. Like Trump, Orban cozies up to Putin and backs the ex-president’s plan to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours — a process that could only happen on the Russian leader’s terms and reward his illegal invasion of a democracy. Orban is the kind of idealized strongman that Trump would like to become and frequently cites at his rallies.In his speech on Thursday, however, Biden was advocating a different kind of strength – one rooted in democracy rather than in trying to destroy it.In summing up his remarks, Biden sought to make his age a virtue rather than a liability, arguing that Trump is a creature of a dangerous past, while he has a positive vision of the future.“I know I may not look like it, but I’ve been around a while,” the president quipped. “When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever. I know the American story. Again and again. I’ve seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our nation.”“Let’s build a future together and let’s remember who we are,” Biden said.That debate about two vastly different visions of the meaning and the soul of the country will decide the fates of both Biden and Trump come November."

        "title": "The SAT exam is now fully digital",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "The SAT college admissions exam is now entirely online.Rather than filling in a bubble answer sheet with a No. 2 pencil, US test-takers will be using a computer. US test-takers will use the fully digital version of the SAT on Saturday, March 9.Prospective college students are still required to go in person to a testing site, but they will take the exam on their personal laptop or tablet, a school-issued device or a borrowed device from the College Board, the non-profit organization that develops and administers the test.The exam is also shorter – down to about two hours instead of three – and more time can be spent on each question. There are shorter reading passages, with one question tied to each, and a built-in calculator.The new SAT is also what the College Board calls “adaptive.” This means that both the math and reading sections will be divided into two parts. The second section will be easier or harder depending on how the test-taker performed in the first section.The exam will still be scored on a 1600-point scale, and the College Board has said that students won’t be disadvantaged if they are routed to an easier second section.Students will get scores back in days, instead of weeks.The changes were announced by the College Board about two years ago after testing a pilot version of the digital SAT in the fall of 2021. Students testing outside the US officially started taking the digital SAT in the spring of 2023, and the PSAT, a shorter exam taken by younger students to qualify for scholarships or as practice for the SAT, was made digital last fall.More than 1.9 million students in the high school class of 2023 took the SAT, up from 1.7 million the year before, according to the College Board.The increase in SAT exam takers came even as many schools have made it optional for students to submit scores from the SAT or ACT, another standardized test used for college admissions. The trend accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic when schools and testing centers were shuttered. In fact, 2,025 US four-year colleges and universities did not require test scores from those applying for the fall 2024 semester.But recently, some elite schools like Brown University, Yale University and Dartmouth College have announced that they will be reversing course and requiring students to include test scores with the applications in future years.Some critics argue that standardized tests put lower-income students at a disadvantage because they may not have the time or resources to prepare for the test. But Brown, Yale and Dartmouth said that looking at test scores, along with high school grades, is a good predictor of students’ future academic success and can help their schools bring in a diverse set of students.Students must register to take the SAT exam – and will also need to sign up at least 30 days ahead of time if they need to borrow a device from the College Board. The test is administered on Saturdays, though some high schools give students the option to sit for the exam during the regular school day."

        "title": "Crews battling massive Texas wildfires get a crucial opportunity to contain flames in calmer weather Monday",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "Firefighters racing to wrangle the largest blaze in Texas history could get their best chance in days to contain the flames in the wake of a cold front Monday. Hot air and raging winds have fueled the infernos in recent days, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble and inflicting harrowing injuries upon ranchers’ livestock.The front arrived Monday morning, bringing an influx of cooler conditions. Breezy winds will taper off early in the afternoon and calmer air will last through Tuesday, giving firefighters a reprieve from the critical fire risk conditions that have aided the wildfires’ explosive spread over the Texas Panhandle.Since igniting last Monday, the ravenous Smokehouse Creek Fire has incinerated more than 1 million acres of the Texas Panhandle and is still only 15% contained. The fire has killed at least two people and crossed into Oklahoma, where more than 31,000 acres have been burned.Five fires tearing across the Panhandle have burned as many as 500 homes and businesses, state officials said. A new blaze – the Roughneck Fire – ignited in Hutchinson County on Sunday and prompted evacuations there as crews raced to get resources to the area.First responders hoped that after the weekend’s severe fire risk, improved conditions in the coming days would allow them to inch closer to containing the infernos, Texas A&M Forest Service spokesperson Jason Nedlo told CNN on Saturday.But the blazes have so far been thriving on a bounty of fuel, including blankets of grass grown after higher-than-average rainfall this winter.“There’s a lot of fuel on the ground,” Nedlo said. “When you add high winds and low humidity to high fuel load levels, that’s when you get the conditions that are ripe for large, fast-burning wildfires.”• New fire prompts evacuations: The Roughneck Fire began burning Sunday and has grown to cover about 300 acres of Hutchinson County, which is also the origin site of the Smokehouse Creek Fire. The blaze prompted an evacuation order in the town of Sanford, which began to be lifted later that evening, county officials said. The Texas A&M Forest Service said that the fire’s forward progression had been halted and it was 50% contained as of Monday afternoon.• Several other fires still burning: The Windy Deuce Fire in Moore County has burned through 144,000 acres and is 55% contained as of Sunday night, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service. The Grape Vine Creek Fire in Gray County has torched nearly 35,000 acres and is 60% contained. The Magenta Fire in Oldham County has destroyed 3,297 acres and is 85% contained.• Significant progress in containing Oklahoma fire: “The Smokehouse Creek Fire perimeter looks good and will be turned back over to local departments tomorrow,” Oklahoma Forestry Services spokesperson Keith Merckx said Sunday. “The fire will be 75% contained by the end of shift today.” The fire has scorched more than 31,500 acres of Oklahoma near its border with Texas.• Lawsuit alleges fallen power pole caused fire: A woman whose home was destroyed by the Smokehouse Creek Fire is suing Xcel Energy, its subsidiary and a contractor, claiming that an improperly maintained power pole fell and started the fire. The Texas A&M Forest Service is investigating the fire, and has not announced a cause.• At least two people are dead: Truck driver Cindy Owen was working about 50 miles north of Pampa, Texas, on Tuesday when the Smokehouse Creek Fire overcame her, her sister-in-law told CNN. She left her truck and tried running for safety but received fatal burns over almost her entire body, said Jennifer Mitchell, the wife of Owen’s brother. In nearby Hutchinson County, 83-year-old Joyce Blankenship was found dead, her family said. “The house was gone,” her grandson Nathan Blankenship said. “There was no way she could’ve gotten out.”• Devastating loss of beef cattle crushes local ranchers: As the fires rip through scores of ranches and acres of farmland, officials report thousands of cattle have been killed and ranchers have been forced to put down many others that have sustained gruesome and painful burns to their hooves, udders and fur. Ranchers and local authorities told CNN that beef prices likely won’t be affected, but the fire may leave lasting economic scars for ranchers.• How you can help: GoFundMe has launched a platform for verified fundraisers benefiting Texans affected by wildfires, including dozens of families who have lost entire homes, belongings or livestock. The Texas Farm Bureau has established a fund to aid farmers and ranchers. CNN’s Impact Your World has also identified several charities assisting wildfire victims.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the state has witnessed damage wrought by tornadoes or hurricanes, but the wildfires have brought unprecedented destruction and “utter devastation” for many Panhandle residents.“Frequently when you see the aftermath of (hurricane or tornado) damage, there is some semblance of a structure that is still there,” Abbott said Friday. “When you look at the damages that are here, it’s just gone. Completely gone. Nothing left but ashes on the ground.”Though officials estimate between 400 to 500 structures have been destroyed, the number could increase as damage assessments continue, Abbot said. ﻿Tyler McCain and his family are among those who frantically evacuated their homes on Tuesday – only to return to find their life’s possessions had been incinerated. He and his wife were able to pack up their three daughters and leave their home in Fritch, Texas in time, but McCain was tortured with doubt over whether their home would be spared.“Until I saw my house, it wasn’t real,” McCain said. The home – razed to the ground – was unrecognizable.Susan and Ronnie Johnson also fought desperately to save their five-bedroom ranch near Fritch, only to watch two decades of their lives go up in flames.“You don’t ever want to believe it’ll be your house that burns,” Ronnie told CNN.Now all that’s left is a pile of charred debris – a dining table, pieces of white fine china, blue and red Dutch ovens, chairs and a smoker were scattered across a devastated scene of dust, rubble and fallen trees.The loss has been “numbing,” Susan said, but she still holds on to the beloved memories she and her family of nine made in the home.“We’ll rebuild and start again,” Ronnie said."

        "title": "House panel unanimously approves bill that could ban TikTok",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "A powerful House committee advanced a bill on Thursday that could lead to a nationwide ban against TikTok on all electronic devices, renewing lawmakers’ challenge to one of the world’s most popular social media apps and highlighting unresolved fears that TikTok may pose a Chinese government spying risk.The measure that sailed unanimously through the House Energy and Commerce Committee would prohibit TikTok from US app stores unless the social media platform — used by roughly 170 million Americans — is quickly spun off from its China-linked parent company, ByteDance.If enacted, the bill would give ByteDance 165 days, or a little more than five months, to sell TikTok. If not divested by that date, it would be illegal for app store operators such as Apple and Google to make it available for download. The bill also contemplates similar prohibitions for other apps “controlled by foreign adversary companies.”It’s the most aggressive legislation targeting TikTok to come out of a congressional committee since company CEO Shou Chew testified to lawmakers last year that the app poses no threat to Americans.“Today, we will take the first step in creating long-overdue laws to protect Americans from the threat posed by apps controlled by our adversaries, and to send a very strong message that the US will always stand up for our values and freedom,” said Washington Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the panel’s chair.New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, its ranking Democrat, compared the bill to prior efforts to regulate the US airwaves, citing testimony from national security officials from a closed-door hearing earlier Thursday.“I take the concerns raised by the intelligence community this morning very seriously,” Pallone said. “They have asked Congress to give them more authority to act in these narrowly defined situations, and I believe that this bill will do that.”The bill was introduced with some bipartisan support earlier this week by Wisconsin Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher, who chairs a House select committee on China, and the ranking member of that committee, Illinois Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi. The legislation also has the support of the White House and House Speaker Mike Johnson.Now that it has cleared the committee, the TikTok legislation will head to a floor vote next week, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said in a post on X Thursday evening. Its fate is less clear in the Senate, where there is no companion bill and the Democratic chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, has made no firm commitment to advance the proposal.“I will be talking to my Senate and House colleagues to try to find a path forward that is constitutional and protects civil liberties,” Cantwell said in a statement to CNN.House lawmakers voted unanimously in the same session Thursday to advance a second bill, one that would limit US companies’ ability to sell Americans’ personal information to foreign adversaries.US officials have cited the widespread commercial availability of US citizens’ data as another source of national security risk. The US government and other domestic law enforcement agencies are also known to have purchased US citizens’ data from commercial data brokers.TikTok is mounting a push against the bill, including trying to mobilize its user base.The company has served some users with full-screen pop-ups in the app warning that the bill “strips 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression.”“This will damage millions of businesses, destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country, and deny artists an audience,” reads the notification, a copy of which was reviewed by CNN.The call to action concludes with a link prompting users to dial their members of Congress and express their opposition to the bill. Multiple congressional staffers told CNN Thursday that House offices are being flooded with phone calls — in some cases in the hundreds — amid the campaign.Many of the calls appear to be coming from teenagers and the elderly, some of whom seem to be “confused” about why they are exactly calling or why TikTok might be at risk, one GOP aide told CNN.Speaking to reporters on the Capitol steps Thursday, Gallagher rejected characterizations of the bill as a TikTok ban.“It’s not a ban,” he said. “It puts the choice squarely in the hands of TikTok to sever their relationship with the Chinese Communist Party. As long as ByteDance no longer owns the company, TikTok can continue to survive. People can continue to do all the dumb dance videos they want on the platform, or communicate with their friends, and all that stuff. But the basic ownership structure has to change.”In a post on X, TikTok rejected lawmaker claims about the legislation providing options for TikTok.“This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,” the company wrote. “The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country.”During Thursday’s session, Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw dismissed criticisms that lawmakers didn’t understand the technology they were trying to regulate.“It’s not because we’re old, and grumpy, and don’t understand TikTok, and how you use it for your business, and how you use it to communicate with your friends,” Crenshaw said. “I was on social media long before any of the Gen Z-ers who are mad about TikTok. I understand.”In addition to potentially barring app stores from hosting TikTok, the bill could also restrict TikTok traffic or content from being carried by “internet hosting services,” a broad term that encompasses a variety of industries including “file hosting, domain name server hosting, cloud hosting, and virtual private server hosting.”That language could mean many more parts of the economy will be affected by the bill than just TikTok, Apple and Google.For years, US officials have warned that China’s intelligence laws could enable Beijing to snoop on the user information TikTok collects, potentially by forcing ByteDance to hand over the data.Policymakers fear the Chinese government could use the personal information to identify intelligence targets or to facilitate mass disinformation campaigns that could disrupt elections and sow other chaos.So far, the US government has not publicly presented any evidence the Chinese government has accessed TikTok user data, and cybersecurity experts say it remains a hypothetical albeit serious concern.They also say governments can already buy vast troves of personal data from data brokers or use commercial spyware to hack individual phones with ease.State and federal lawmakers have already banned TikTok from government-owned devices, but have repeatedly run aground in trying to broaden restrictions to Americans’ personal devices.Last year, Senate lawmakers proposed legislation clamping down on TikTok but triggered concerns that it could give the executive branch too much power.Efforts to ban TikTok date to the Trump administration, which used a series of executive orders to try to force app stores not to offer TikTok and to compel ByteDance to spin off the company. Those efforts also stalled amid legal challenges, though it led TikTok to engage in negotiations with the US government about how it could secure Americans’ personal data. Those talks are ongoing, even as TikTok has moved to store US user data on US-based servers controlled by the tech giant Oracle.In Montana, a federal judge last year temporarily blocked a statewide ban on TikTok, calling the legislation overly broad and threatening Montanan users’ First Amendment rights to access information through the app.A legislative factsheet from the sponsors of the House bill claims the proposal does not censor speech.“It is focused entirely on foreign adversary control—not the content of speech being shared,” the factsheet says.But the overall effect of the bill would still implicate Americans’ free speech rights, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.“We’re deeply disappointed that our leaders are once again attempting to trade our First Amendment rights for cheap political points during an election year,” said Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU. “Just because the bill sponsors claim that banning TikTok isn’t about suppressing speech, there’s no denying that it would do just that. We strongly urge legislators to vote no on this unconstitutional bill.”And the bill would also threaten the free-speech rights of tech powerhouses Apple and Google, said a major trade group representing those companies.“The government may not tell private parties, including digital service companies, what speech they may publish. The First Amendment forbids it,” said Stephanie Joyce, senior vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association. “The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would infringe the First Amendment rights of private businesses, including app stores, to curate and display content they believe is appropriate for their communities.”CNN’s Haley Talbot and Melanie Zanona contributed to this report."

        "text": "An independent investigator tasked with probing the local police response to the May 2022 school massacre in Uvalde, Texas, presented his report at a packed city council meeting Thursday, clearing all local officers of wrongdoing and sparking the fury of many victims’ families who denounced the findings and pleaded for accountability nearly two years after the attack.The investigator, Jesse Prado, a retired Austin police detective, did not identify any officers who violated policy in his report and said they acted in good faith, whereas multiple agencies have previously agreed law enforcement botched its response to the massacre.“You said that they did it in good faith. You call that good faith? They stood there 77 minutes and waited after they got call after call that kids were still alive in there,” said Veronica Mata, whose 10-year-old daughter Tess was killed. “We’re going to stand here and we’re going to keep fighting for our own, because nobody else is going to do it.”Prado left immediately after presenting his findings but later returned to the meeting after parents demanded he come back.The meeting, which opened with a prayer, devolved into anger and shouting as Prado admitted his probe found “many failures” in the law enforcement response but did not identify specific local police officers for not doing their jobs that day.Instead, his 182-page report cleared local police of wrongdoing and said the officers acted in good faith. Among those cleared was Uvalde Police Lt. Javier Martinez – the highest-ranking police officer among those who first entered the school. Martinez rushed to the classroom but retreated after he was shot at by the gunman and injured. Staff Sgt. Eduardo Canales, the second point of contact inside the school, was also exonerated.“I want you to think about the people that you love most in this world: your children, a spouse, a parent. You think about them huddled together in a dark room with a deranged person with an AR-15. Somebody calls 911,” Kimberly Mata-Rubio, whose daughter Lexi was killed, told city leaders at the meeting. “Help is on the way. Are these the people that you want responding to your loved ones? Guaranteed, it’s not.”Some members of other families left the meeting before Prado concluded his remarks. Others who spoke after Mata-Rubio were also angry and emotional after listening to the findings and vowed to continue fighting for accountability on behalf of the young children and teachers who were killed.Council member Ernest “Chip” W. King III told residents he, too, was disappointed with the findings.“I’ve been shaking for the last hour. I’m so pissed off about what happened,” he said. “We’ve not seen the report. This is the first time we’ve heard it… But I assure you this is not what we wanted and this did not happen how we thought it would happen.”Felisha Martinez, mother of victim Xavier Lopez, said she followed Prado after he left the meeting to ask him “if he really felt what he had to say today was the right thing.”“How does he sleep at night knowing that this is what he had to say?” she told CNN. “He hurt all of us today… There was cops already in there, and they didn’t do nothing. They froze. Us parents, families were willing to go into that school, willing to give their lives for them to get them out.”Uvalde police officers followed orders as they were supposed to, Prado said. He pointed to one Border Patrol tactical commander who led the entry team that killed the shooter and who, Prado said, called off a move that could have stopped the gunman half an hour earlier.There was a point in time when officers were preparing to make entry to the classroom, but commander Paul Guerrero feared it would take too long to force the door open, Prado said.“They didn’t have the rifle-rated shield at that point yet, but they were going to move forward after shots were fired at about 12:21 and they stopped because the BORTAC commander was not comfortable or confident that they could get in with enough time using a Halligan tool to breach the door. So, they requested a key instead,” he said.Prado found Guerrero was the one who made the call to stop at that time.An earlier report from the Texas House contradicted Prado’s assertions, saying U.S. Marshals did deliver a rifle-rated shield at 12:20 p.m.But if Prado’s timeline is accurate, it would answer the outstanding question of what happened after officers rushed towards the doors of the classrooms with children after four shots were fired inside, but then stopped and retreated.Guerrero did not mention the aborted advance in his statement to investigators shortly after the massacre. He did say he was told the door was locked and that he determined it would take too long to force it open, according to the statement previously obtained by CNN.Prado earlier Thursday began his presentation by telling city officials the local prosecutor made it difficult for him to gather evidence.“I had a lot of difficulty in gathering all the evidence … the information that I needed to complete a thorough examination of what these officers did,” Prado told city officials. “The district attorney did not allow me to receive a copy of information regarding this case from other sources, other agencies.”CNN has reached out to Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell for comment.The results of the city’s independent investigation – one of multiple probes into what the US Justice Department and other agencies have agreed was a disastrous law enforcement response – comes as the seemingly elusive quest for accountability by families of the victims approaches its second year.The meeting also comes days after two men criticized for their failures to challenge the Uvalde school shooter and rescue children and teachers trapped in the carnage won support from voters to continue as law enforcement leaders in the Texas community.The election results stunned and upset families of victims who have maintained that law enforcement could have saved lives that day.Six weeks after the massacre, former Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin told CNN he had lost faith in the larger investigation into what had happened and feared a cover-up was happening.In July 2022, the Uvalde City Council said it was launching its own investigation into the actions of every city police officer who responded. The council appointed Jesse Prado, a former Austin police detective, to lead the investigation.The decision by Mitchell to withhold information that would normally be public while she completed her investigation added to the lack of transparency.In June 2022, Mitchell told CNN she did not want records or videos released while investigations were ongoing. “Any release of records to that incident at this time would interfere with said ongoing investigation and would impede a thorough and complete investigation,” she said in a statement.A coalition of major news organizations, including CNN, filed a lawsuit to obtain records in a case that has not yet been decided.Mitchell was also sued twice by McLaughlin when he was mayor for failing to share evidence from and concerning Uvalde police officers with the investigator, Jesse Prado.CNN analyzed body camera and surveillance video, along with radio transmissions and phone calls, to create a timeline that showed the initial action and almost immediate loss of impetus that left the gunman unchallenged inside the school for 77 minutes.That analysis preceded and concurred with the Department of Justice fact-finding report released in January that highlighted repeated failures of leadership and lost opportunities to stop the bloodshed earlier.CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz and Linh Tran contributed to this report."

        "category": "us",
        "text": "Boeing is now party to a new federal investigation involving a 737 Max after United Airlines pilots reported that part of the flight controls became jammed as they landed in Newark last month.In a newly-released preliminary report of the February 6 incident, the National Transportation Safety board says the pilots of the Boeing 737 Max 8 “experienced ‘stuck’ rudder pedals during the landing rollout.” The rudder controls an airplane’s yaw, or the left and right swinging of the nose.The NTSB says none of the 161 people on United flight 1539 were injured and the plane returned to the gate, though United maintenance crews were able to “duplicate the reported rudder system malfunction” during a test flight three days later.The investigation is the latest to involve a nearly-new Boeing 737 Max aircraft following the door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 on January 5. The NTSB says in this latest incident, the 737 Max 8 was delivered from Boeing to United Airlines in February 2023.The NTSB says the servo in question was disabled by United Airlines, but cold temperature tests by the company that makes an autopilot servo that is connected to the 737 Max 8 rudder controls, Collins Aerospace, as part of the investigation revealed the servo’s “output crank arm would prevent the rudder pedals from moving.”“We’re grateful to our pilots and maintenance teams for their professionalism in diagnosing this issue. We’ll continue to work with Boeing, the NTSB and the FAA on next steps for these aircraft,” United said in a statement.This is the first instance of this issue being reported on a 737 Max, according to a source familiar with the matter, but not the first instance on any Boeing plane.A similar occurrence was reported twice, both in 2019, on the previous model of 737. That aircraft – the 737 Next Generation – uses a rudder pedal system. In both previous cases, the issue was fixed by replacing parts on the plane, the source said.“We worked closely with United Airlines to diagnose the rudder response issue,” Boeing said in a statement. “With coordination with United, the issue was successfully resolved with the replacement of three parts and the airplane returned to service last month.”United said the faulty parts are not part of the typical configuration used on its aircraft. The plane was originally built for another airline but went to United instead."

        "title": "A second military projectile has been magnet-fished from the same Massachusetts river in less than a week",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "The discovery of a bazooka round on Wednesday marks the second time in a matter of days that a magnet fishing hobbyist pulled a military projectile from the Charles River in Needham, Massachusetts – raising questions about why old pieces of ordnance are being found there out of the blue.It was “business as usual” for Josh Parker, a Brockton magnet fisherman and YouTuber, as he was magnet fishing with his friends on Wednesday morning, he said. That’s when he discovered the bazooka round in the water.“I pulled it up and I was speechless. … I couldn’t even get words out,” Parker told CNN on Wednesday.On Friday, another Brockton magnet fisherman and YouTuber, Sean Martell, pulled out a military projectile from the same stretch of river. That one, about 12 inches long and 4 inches in diameter, was in a “severely deteriorated state” and is believed to date from the World War I or World War II eras, a Massachusetts State Police spokesman said.This week’s military projectile discovery was an old, heavily deteriorated bazooka round potentially from the World War II era, the state police spokesman, Dave Procopio, told CNN on Wednesday. Parker said he and about four other men pulled it out of the water.After Parker pulled the projectile out of the river, two people from the Massachusetts State Police bomb squad arrived at about 1 p.m., took the round to a secure location and “safely counter-charged” it, rendering it safe, according to Procopio. It was disposed of in an unspecified area of town, according to a Facebook post from Needham police.“The discovery of the round was the second time in a matter of days that a member of a magnet fishing group pulled an old piece of military ordnance from the Charles River under the Kendrick Street bridge,” Procopio said. “This begs: Why are these objects being found there all of a sudden?”CNN has sought comment from Needham town managers. Needham is about an 18-mile drive southwest of Boston.“In our experience, it is not common for people fishing with magnets to locate ordnance in bodies of water,” Procopio said. More often, they’ll wash up on a beach or be dug up at a construction site, he said.Parker’s YouTube channel, 508 Magnets, invites viewers to follow him on “adventures as I magnet fish, dive and metal detect for hidden treasures all across Massachusetts and New England.”“I’m glad it was me who pulled it up and not some kid,” Parker said, adding that he’s glad it’s out of the water so that the river is safer for those who frequent it.“Magnet fishing is a great hobby. We’re cleaning the waterway, making sure it’s a better place for people and wildlife,” Martell told CNN after finding the projectile last week. “It’s taken a lot of impurities out of the water, makes it safer.”"

        "title": "Deadly explosions at a Detroit-area retail vape shop sent canisters and switch blades caught in the fire through air",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "Authorities believe the Michigan vaping supplies distributor that went up in flames Monday night in Clinton Township was illegally storing canisters of butane and other materials, township officials said Tuesday.A 19-year-old man was killed by flying debris and a firefighter was injured as explosions took place, officials said.Clinton Township Supervisor Robert Cannon said the business was not permitted to have the canisters of butane, which is highly flammable.“They were illegally in that building,” Cannon told reporters at a news conference Tuesday evening.In a news release on the township website, officials said: “According to the (fire department), stored in the facility, among other items, were containers of butane, nitrous oxide, lighter fluid, and vape pens. Containers, or canisters, were 12 to 18 inches in size, weighing 10 to 15 pounds.”Authorities continue to investigate what materials were stored on site and in what quantities, Clinton Township Fire Chief Tim Duncan said.The shop, identified as Goo LLC, was permitted to operate as a retail mercantile business with some storage in a former supermarket location, property records and authorities confirm.But in the past week, the retailer – which authorities estimate to have been storing more than 100,000 vape pens – had received a truckload of butane and still had over half of that left, in addition to nitrous oxide, propane and other products, Duncan said at an earlier news conference.When Goo received its permit, it was designated as a storefront with a back room to store retail products, Barry Miller, Clinton Township building superintendent, told reporters earlier.CNN has reached out to one of the known business owners of Goo to seek comment.Clinton Township Emergency Management Coordinator Paul Brouwer said the owners have been cooperative and forthright so far.The business was closed but employees were on site fulfilling online orders when the incident began, authorities said.The fire is under control but there are still some debris piles that are smoking with occasional canisters exploding, Brouwer said. The township is under a state of emergency, he added.Clinton Township building authorities inspected Goo in September of 2022 and while they were aware of vape pens, they found no canisters, Miller said.“Without those tanks we don’t have this issue, so that’s really the core of it,” the fire chief said.There is an allowable quantity of canisters the shop could have stored.“Obviously with what happened last night, they (Goo) were well over what would have been allowable for that site,” Miller said.In addition to canisters, butane and lithium batteries, switch blades and knives that had flown through the air during the explosions were found, Duncan said.Police and the ATF interviewed two business owners Monday night, authorities said.It’s hard to estimate how much product was inside the building that shouldn’t have been, Cannon said, because a lot of it blew up and is now strewn around the township. Officials said there was debris as far as 2 miles away.Duncan was 7 to 8 miles from the scene when he got the call about the blaze, the fire chief said. The explosions at the scene were so intense they could be heard from that distance – and shook his vehicle as he approached the scene, he added.Flames lit up the sky as the inferno released massive plumes of smoke and showers of embers into the air, while bright flashes occasionally burst through the blaze, footage from CNN affiliate WXYZ shows.Authorities worked through the night and early morning Tuesday, where fire could still be seen smoldering, clearing debris from the roadways and area parking lots, police said.“You’ll see … some of these products where the actual top is blown off and the canister went up like a missile. And then you have other ones that blew up in place and then came over. So you’re seeing a variety of full canisters and then ones that are totally blown apart and basically shrapnel going through the air,” Duncan said.The 19-year-old man who died has not been named but he was a Clinton Township resident, officials said. He was around a quarter of a mile from the fire when he was struck on the head, Duncan said. He was pronounced dead at around 4 a.m., the chief said. Investigators are still working to determine the exact cause of death.A firefighter was injured from flying glass shrapnel but is expected to recover, the chief said.The inferno broke out near 15 Mile Road and Groesbeck Highway, police said. The large intersection includes a gas station, hardware store and a building belonging to an automotive supplies manufacturer.At least three ladder trucks with Snorkel apparatus, platforms at the end of ladders with fire hose nozzles, were pouring water on the blaze as more firefighters wielded hoses and other gear on the ground, aerial footage from CNN affiliates WDIV and WXYZ shows.“As firefighters, your first thought is, you see fire, you want to go put it out,” he said. “They (firefighters) were trying to approach it and obviously with the explosions, there was absolutely no way that we could do that.”Duncan said Tuesday morning there was no danger to the community, no drinking water issues or air quality concerns after a hazmat team assessed the zone, but urged residents to stay clear of the area as authorities investigate further.“We’ll give it some additional time to see if we have any more explosions,” Duncan said. “We’re going to probably bring a piece of apparatus over here to help with some of the additional suppression on it … involve the ATF … and then once we get that clear, we’ll get our people on site and start digging through.”“It’s still too unstable, too unsafe for our people to get over on the scene, so we’re probably gonna have to bring another engine over here to suppress the smoke and stuff going on, so obviously safety is crucial for our people,” he said.This story has been updated with additional information."

        "title": "CNN Poll: More than 6 in 10 SOTU viewers had a positive reaction to Biden’s speech",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "More than 6 in 10 Americans who watched President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address had a positive reaction to the speech, according to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, with a smaller 35% reacting very positively.That pattern of widespread but tempered positivity mirrors the reception for Biden’s speeches in previous years. Last year, 72% of viewers reacted positively, with 34% saying their reaction was very positive – the lowest “very positive” number in CNN’s polling dating back to 1998. In 2022, 71% had a positive reaction, with 41% saying their reaction was very positive.As in the past two years, Democratic speech watchers’ reactions to Biden were almost universally positive, with about two-thirds of independents who tuned in offering a positive reaction. Roughly three-quarters of Republicans who watched this year’s address offered a negative review, up from about 6 in 10 for Biden’s past two State of the Union addresses.Americans who watched on Thursday said, 62% to 38%, that the policies Biden proposed will move the US in the right direction, rather than the wrong direction. In a survey conducted before the speech, just 45% of those same people said Biden’s policies would move the US in the right direction.Just over 6 in 10 Americans who tuned in expressed at least some confidence in Biden to protect American democracy, while 59% say they have at least some confidence in Biden’s overall ability to carry out his duties as president. Thirty-six percent of those who watched the speech said they have a lot of confidence in Biden to protect American democracy, with 27% expressing some confidence and 37% saying they have no real confidence in him.Following the speech, 31% of those who watched said they have a lot of confidence in Biden’s ability to carry out his duties as president, 28% that they have some confidence, and 41% that they have no real confidence. That’s a slight uptick from a survey conducted in the days before the speech, when 25% of those same people expressed a lot of confidence in his ability, 27% some confidence, and 48% none at all.Much of Biden’s improvement on this score came among political independents who watched the speech. Before the speech, 51% of independents expressed at least some confidence in Biden’s ability to carry out his duties, and that rose to 68% among the same group of independents after the speech. Perceptions of Biden’s ability to carry out the duties of the presidency did not change significantly among either Democrats or Republicans who tuned in.Good marks from speech-watchers are typical for presidential addresses to Congress, which tend to attract generally friendly audiences that disproportionately hail from their own party. In CNN speech reaction polls dating back to the Clinton era, audience reactions have always been positive. But State of the Union addresses rarely lead to significant shifts in presidential approval among the broader American public, particularly in recent years.A 56% majority of Americans who watched the address said that Biden’s economic policies will move the US in the right direction, with 44% saying that his policies will move things in the wrong direction. That’s an improvement from the survey conducted prior to the speech, when 55% of those same people said Biden’s economic proposals would move things in the wrong direction, with much of that movement also coming among independents, from 41% right direction in the pre-speech poll to 61% after the speech. Following last year’s State of the Union, however, a larger 66% majority of those who watched that speech said Biden’s economic policies would move the country in the right direction; in 2022, that number was 62%.About half (53%) of Americans who watched the address said that Biden’s immigration policies will move the US in the right direction, up from 42% in the pre-speech survey. Here, the pre-speech to post-speech change included a shift among both Democrats (from 71% to 83% right direction) and independents (from 42% to 56%).About half of State of the Union viewers, 52%, said that Biden’s proposed policies supporting abortion rights are about what they should be, according to the CNN poll of speech watchers conducted by SSRS. Another 29% said that his policies go too far, and 19% that they don’t go far enough.Roughly half of speech watchers, 53%, also said that the level of US support Biden proposes offering to Israel is about right, with 28% saying he’s proposing too much support, and 20% not enough. And a similar 49% of those who tuned in said Biden’s proposed levels of US aid for Ukraine are about right, with 34% saying Biden’s proposed level of Ukraine aid is too much, and 16% that it’s not enough.A 42% plurality of speech watchers younger than 45 said that Biden’s proposals offer too much support to Israel, an opinion shared by just 22% of viewers age 45 and older. There’s a more modest age divide on Biden’s proposed level of aid to Ukraine.The CNN poll was conducted by text message with 529 US adults who said they watched the State of the Union on Thursday, and are representative of the views of speech-watchers only. Respondents were recruited to participate before the speech, and were selected by a survey of members of the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative panel recruited using probability-based sampling techniques. Results for the full sample of speech-watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.6 percentage points."

        "category": "us",
        "text": "Two weeks after a 3-year-old Wisconsin boy vanished, law enforcement is urging homeowners and businesses to review surveillance footage for a vehicle of interest so they can track its movements from the day before the child went missing, police said Tuesday.Elijah Vue was last seen on February 20 in the city of Two Rivers while he was being watched by Jesse Vang, a man who was in a relationship with the boy’s mother, Katrina Baur, according to a criminal complaint filed in Manitowoc County. Vang told police he noticed Elijah was gone when he woke up from a nap at his home and the child wasn’t there, according to the complaint.Both Baur, 31, and Vang, 39, were charged with felony child neglect about a week after his disappearance. Baur also was charged with a felony count of chronic child neglect in an amended complaint filed Thursday and obtained by CNN affiliate WLUK. CNN has sought comment from attorneys representing Baur and Vang.Police in Two Rivers on Tuesday asked the public to share camera footage of a 1997 four-door Nissan Altima, beige in color, bearing Wisconsin registration beginning with “A” and ending with “0,” according to the police department.Authorities are currently in possession of the vehicle and “Jesse Vang and Katrina Baur are not owners of the vehicle,” according to a news release from the police on Tuesday.Police went on to say their “interest is not with the current owner of the vehicle, only in the camera footage captured on February 19, 2024, between the hours of 2:00 PM - 9:00 PM.”Law enforcement from across Wisconsin, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Division of Criminal Investigation and Department of Natural Resources scoured rural areas in Manitowoc County on Tuesday, the release said.“A child missing for any amount of time is everyone’s worst nightmare,” said Two Rivers Police Chief Ben Meinnert during a press conference last week.An Amber Alert has been issued for the toddler, whose been described as having dark blond hair and brown eyes, according to police. He was last seen wearing gray pants, a long-sleeve dark shirt, red and green dinosaur shoes and possibly carrying a red and white plaid blanket.A reward for information leading to the discovery of the child or the arrest of the persons responsible for his disappearance is now up to $25,000, the police department said.“We stand before you today with heavy hearts burdened by an unimaginable situation. The pain is indescribable, a torment no family or child should ever face,” Elijah’s aunt Linda Vue said at last week’s press conference. “We cannot express the depth of our sorrow, nor the desperation that consumes us as each moment passes without news of Elijah’s safety.”"

        "title": "Minnesota faces complaint over alleged unfair treatment of Black children and families in its child welfare system",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "The Minneapolis Branch of the NAACP and Children’s Rights, an advocacy group, have filed a complaint with the US Department of Health and Human Services against Minnesota for allegedly discriminating against Black children and families in its child welfare system.Minnesota’s “pattern and practice of utilizing federal funds to discriminatorily surveil and separate Black families, specifically in Hennepin and Ramsey counties, as detailed herein, clearly warrant investigation into the violations of Title VI and its implementing regulations,” the complaint, filed Monday, stated.According to the complaint, Minnesota received more than $232 million in federal funding in 2020 for child protections agencies.Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “provides that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”“For far too long, forces within our government have worked to divide, and decimate Black families and communities. Let’s be clear - federal dollars should never be used as tools of discrimination,” NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said in a press release.The NAACP and Children’s Rights allege that because the state’s child welfare agency receives federal funds, it is required to treat all families equally and not discriminate.“Federally funded child welfare agencies are required under Title VI to provide non-discriminatory services when fulfilling their responsibilities of protecting the children and families they serve,” the complaint states.The complaint stated that “Between 2019 and 2021, mandated reporters in schools, law enforcement, and social services, made a greater percentage of reports about Black children than white children across Minnesota and in Hennepin and Ramsey counties.”Hennepin County is 69.9% White, according to the complaint, but in the last five years, Black children accounted for 53% of the report handled by the Department of Human Services.“Black children were the subject of more than 35% of all reports which included neglect as the allegation type, while white children constituted less than 20% of those neglect reports,” the complaint stated.In Ramsey County Black children comprised 41% to 46% of the reports made in the last five years, the complaint states, despite the county being 63.6% White, and “white children make up less than 35% of all reports” in the same years.In Minnesota, “cases involving Black children are more likely to result in an investigation or assessment, as well as removal and family separation, than cases involving white children,” the complaint states.When reached by CNN, the Minnesota Department of Human Services said the department is “working to strengthen the child protection system and address disparities” working alongside the local community. “We are committed to building on the strengths of communities and providing supports for families so they can raise children in safe, healthy, nurturing environments,” the Minnesota DHS statement said.Addressing the specific complaint filed against the state, Minnesota’s DHS told CNN in a statement “We are reviewing the complaint submitted to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights. Out of respect to the possible investigation into this complaint, we are declining to comment further at this time.”“Black children across Minnesota were two times more likely, and biracial or multiracial children were seven times more likely than White children to be removed and placed in a foster home,” the complaint stated, “Between 2019 and 2021, child welfare agencies removed Black children from their homes in Hennepin and Ramsey counties with a degree of disproportionality that outpaced state and national trends. Percentages of removals involving Black children during those years ranged from 33% to 38% in Hennepin County and 33% to 37% in Ramsey County compared to 14% to 15% statewide and 23% to 24% across the U.S.”The result, the complaint states, is that “over the last three years, the disproportionate percentage of Black children who have been reported, who have been investigated from screened-in reports, and who have been removed from their homes, has remained relatively unchanged.”“We placed the state of Minnesota on notice that we’re watching,” Johnson told CNN. He said it’s now up to HHS Office of Civil Rights to conduct a thorough investigation.“The next step is to see how widespread it is, and what remedies should be put in place to protect the children and families from such harsh usage of federal dollars,” Johnson said.Shereen White, Director of Advocacy and Policy at Children’s Rights said its time to end child separations based solely on the color of one’s skin.“The nation has failed children. Every 2.5 minutes, a child in the U.S. is separated from their family and placed in the foster system, most often for reasons related to the color of their skin or the poverty they experience – not because they are hurting their kids,” White said in the release.“The discriminatory use of ‘emergency removals’ and implementation of safety assessment tools is devastating Black families in Minnesota,” White added.CNN has also reached out to the US Department of Health and Human Services."

        "category": "us",
        "text": "Two men criticized for their failures to challenge the Uvalde school shooter and rescue children and teachers trapped in the carnage won support from voters to continue as law enforcement leaders in the Texas community.The results stunned and upset families of victims who feel there has been little accountability for the delayed law enforcement response that could have possibly saved lives.Uvalde County Sheriff Ruben Nolasco came top in his Republican primary election with 39% of votes and is set for a runoff, according to unofficial results published by the county. Constable Emmanuel Zamora won his Republican primary on Tuesday. Neither has a Democratic opponent.Both men were named and shamed in a Department of Justice report that aimed to give a full, official accounting of what happened on May 24, 2022, when a teenage shooter opened unlocked doors to get into two 4th grade classrooms, opened fire with an assault-style rifle and was left alone with dead, dying and traumatized victims for more than an hour before he was stopped. Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the Robb Elementary massacre.Another officer named in the DOJ report, Constable Johnny Field, came second in his Republican primary to Max Dorflinger, whom unofficial results show just cleared the 50% barrier to avoid a runoff. An officer with the Uvalde Police Department, Dorflinger also responded to the school shooting and body camera footage shows him going in and out of the building carrying boxes of supplies.Tuesday’s election highlights the splits in the Uvalde community, where families of survivors and those killed have called for law enforcement officers who failed to stop the massacre to be fired while their neighbors supported them at the ballot box.Shooting survivor, Khloie Torres repeatedly called 911 from Room 112 begging for police to help and giving clear information about where she was and how there were dead and injured classmates and teachers with her. She and her mom sent a voice message about the election to CNN. “I’m just mad,” Khloie said.“Who would vote for officers who didn’t want to save kids? How does that go through their mind? How do they live every day knowing that those kids died and they voted for the cops that should have saved them? I physically do not know what those people who vote for those police officers were thinking whenever they did it. And especially the officers … they’re told, they literally said on their contracts whenever they signed to be a police officer, ‘I’m going to serve and protect.’”Kassandra Chavez’s son AJ was shot through his thigh and had to wait with Khloie for help. When officers finally entered his classroom, he was hustled out with other students and loaded onto a school bus to get to the hospital as ambulances could not get through to the school.“I’m very upset because this whole town knows that they failed the kids and the teachers and they still voted for these people,” Chavez said in a message to CNN on Wednesday. She said she hoped there would be some challengers in the November general election. “I pray that we get some good candidates to run up against them,” she wrote.Chavez also posted an emotional public message to her son on Facebook: “I’m so sorry baby boy the system won again tonight … these men that didn’t have balls that day don’t deserve to be holding a badge but yet others say they do!!”As elected officials, the only way to remove the sheriff and constables is by voting. Their elected status was also why the Department of Justice chose to name Nolasco, Field and Zamora, along with then school police chief Pedro “Pete” Arredondo and then acting chief of the Uvalde Police Department Lt. Mariano Pargas.The damning DOJ report said officers had many opportunities to intervene to stop the bloodshed far earlier. Instead, it took 77 minutes from when the shooter walked into the school until he was taken down.The law enforcement leaders came in for particular criticism in the 575-page report.“On the day of the incident, no leader effectively questioned the decisions and lack of urgency of UCISD PD Chief Arredondo and UPD Acting Chief Pargas toward entering classrooms 111/112, including within their respective agencies and agencies with concurrent/overlapping jurisdiction (e.g., Uvalde County Sheriff Nolasco, Constable Zamora, Constable Field, TX Ranger 1),” the report said.Body camera footage and interviews by investigators obtained by CNN show Field, at one end of the school hallway, was frequently on the phone with Arredondo, at the other end. Zamora was also one of the earliest responders to reach the hallway. He spent time looking for keys that were not needed and even tried to pry a door lock with a knife. The report also noted how he tried to bring some order to the chaos in the hallway after the gunman was killed, calling for medics to be let through the crowd of officers to see what help the victims needed.The DOJ analysis confirmed CNN reporting that Nolasco knew the name of the gunman when he arrived at the school and that the teenager had shot his grandmother in the face earlier that morning.“Sheriff Nolasco did not seek out or establish a command post, establish unified command, share the intelligence he learned from (the shooter’s) relatives, nor did he assign an intelligence officer to gather intelligence on the subject. At one point, Sheriff Nolasco and UPD Acting Chief Pargas were within 10-15 feet of each other outside the exterior door of the northwest hallway; however, they were not coordinating with one another and continued to act independently,” the Justice Department report said.It added bluntly: “Uvalde County Sheriff Nolasco, despite being the chief law enforcement officer for the county, lacked leadership and incident command training and did not demonstrate adequate command leadership during the incident by not coordinating the resources from the Sheriff’s Office or helping to establish a unified command.”Nolasco has declined to respond to most questions from CNN, but in November 2022 he did answer when asked if he thought his response was adequate: “Yeah,” he said. “I do.”Little has been resolved even as the two-year mark since the killings approaches. Local District Attorney Christina Mitchell – unopposed in her own Republican primary and with no Democratic challenger – has begun presenting evidence to a special grand jury but there is no public timeline for when she may announce if there could be criminal charges for any of the first responders who waited in the hallway.A report into the actions of Uvalde Police Department officers is set to be released this week. Former Mayor Don McLaughlin, who commissioned the report, said it had been long delayed because Mitchell would not share evidence with the city’s independent investigator.In June 2022, Mitchell told CNN she did not want records or videos released while investigations were ongoing.The school board fired Arredondo after he was blamed as the de facto incident commander. He has said he never considered himself to be in charge. Pargas chose to resign from the Uvalde Police Department under threat of being fired after CNN revealed he was told children were injured in the classroom and he did not organize a rescue. Pargas was reelected to his county commission seat less than six months after the tragedy, defeating three write-in candidates who included Javier Cazares, whose 9-year-old daughter Jackie was killed in the massacre. Jackie had a pulse when she was finally brought out of the classroom but died later that day. Kimberly Mata-Rubio, whose daughter Lexi, aged 10, was also killed, lost her bid to be the city’s mayor last year."

        "text": "A former congressional candidate who once ran for office in Nevada and Texas has been arrested on a murder charge in the death of a man exonerated after serving more than 20 years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit.A criminal complaint filed Monday in Las Vegas Justice Court alleges Daniel Rodimer, 45, killed Christopher Tapp, 47, after a fight in a Las Vegas hotel room in October.An arrest warrant affidavit from a Las Vegas police detective indicates the fight was unrelated to Tapp’s earlier wrongful conviction.Rodimer was arrested Wednesday and released on a $200,000 bond, the court docket shows. His attorneys, David Z. Chesnoff and Richard A. Schonfeld, tell CNN there were no travel restrictions included in the bond.“He intends on vigorously contesting the allegations and asks that the presumption of innocence guaranteed all Americans be respected,” Chesnoff and Schonfeld said in a written statement.Rodimer – a former professional wrestler from New Jersey – unsuccessfully ran for Congress in Nevada in 2020 and in a special election in Texas in 2021.Tapp was convicted of murder and rape in the fatal stabbing of an 18-year-old Idaho woman and sentenced to life in prison in 1998. He was imprisoned for 21 years before his conviction was overturned after DNA testing proved that another man was responsible.Tapp advocated for others who were wrongfully convicted. He worked alongside Idaho Sen. Doug Ricks to help pass state legislation that compensates those who spent time behind bars for crimes they did not commit, according to CNN affiliate EastIdahoNews.com.According to the police detective’s affidavit obtained by CNN affiliate KTNV, Rodimer and Tapp attended the same Halloween party on October 30 at Resorts World Las Vegas. Witnesses told police that Rodimer became upset after Tapp allegedly offered cocaine to Rodimer’s stepdaughter, the affidavit stated. CNN has requested a copy of the affidavit.A witness told police that he heard Rodimer say, “If you ever talk to my daughter again, I’ll f**king kill you,” immediately followed by “two loud banging noises,” according to the affidavit attached to the complaint.A witness who spoke to police said she saw Rodimer “knock Christopher to the ground, at which time Christopher’s head hit a small table.”Then, Rodimer punched Tapp “throughout his head and body,” the affidavit stated. Other witnesses said they later found Tapp on a bed awake but with a swollen face and “a large mark on the left side of his neck.”Tapp was taken to the hospital, where he died several days later.The Medical Examiner ruled Tapp’s death a homicide by blunt head trauma, according to the criminal complaint."

        "category": "us",
        "text": "A man accused of crashing into a Washington State Patrol trooper’s vehicle – killing the trooper – on an interstate highway near Seattle over the weekend has been charged in the officer’s death, officials said.Trooper Christopher M. Gadd, 27, was killed around 3 a.m. Saturday when a driver struck Gadd’s parked patrol vehicle on the side of Interstate 5 in Marysville, about 30 miles north of Seattle, authorities said in a news release and a probable cause affidavit.The suspect, Raul Benitez Santana, remained at the scene of the crash and was taken into custody, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office. He has been charged with vehicular homicide, the county prosecutor’s office said Tuesday.Santana – a 32-year-old Mexican citizen who entered the US illegally “at an unknown date and time, without admission or parole by an immigration officer,” a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement official told CNN – “admitted to smoking a bowl of marijuana at approximately 9pm” and “admitted to having 1 drink of alcohol prior to the collision,” according to the arrest affidavit.His arrest comes amid a reinvigorated national debate over immigration policies in the wake of the killing of Georgia college student Laken Riley, who authorities say was attacked by an undocumented Venezuelan migrant. State and national Republican leaders have touted Riley’s case to support their calls for tighter border security measures – though there is little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime levels.CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Santana. CNN contacted the Snohomish County Public Defender Association, but the office would not confirm if they represented Santana.ICE officials previously said Santana was 33 but later updated his age to 32.Santana was first encountered by ICE personnel in October 2013 in Burien, Washington, after he was arrested on suspicion of “failure to appear” after being accused of driving with a suspended license, according to the ICE official.Immigration officials in Seattle have placed Santana under an immigration detainer, an ICE spokesperson said. Such a detainer is a request to local law enforcement to keep people suspected of being undocumented migrants in custody so they can be picked up by ICE.About 3 and 1/2 hours after Saturday’s crash, Santana’s voluntary preliminary breath test resulted in a .047 reading, the arrest affidavit said. Federal law requires all states to follow a BAC limit of no more than 0.08%.Santana is being held in Snohomish County Jail on a $1 million bond and appeared in court Monday, O’Keefe said. He is being held on a vehicular homicide charge in Gadd’s death and a vehicular assault charge related to an injury to the driver of a third vehicle, Michael C. Held with the Snohomish County Prosecutor’s Office told CNN on Wednesday and court records show.Gadd appeared to be watching traffic while sitting in his marked patrol vehicle, which was seen parked on the shoulder of the interstate with its lights off when it was struck, the affidavit filed by a county sheriff’s deputy reads, citing a witness, who provided investigators with dash camera video that corroborated what he saw.Santana’s car was “driving at a high rate of speed, swerved and struck the rear end of Trooper Gadd’s patrol vehicle,” the witness said.Then, Santana’s car “bounced off Trooper Gadd’s vehicle and went towards the fast lane and stopped” where he was hit by a van carrying six people, the witness recalled, according to the affidavit and dashcam video.The van’s driver suffered a broken wrist, police wrote in the affidavit.Washington State Patrol Chief John R. Batiste said he has expressed the agency’s “profound sorrow” to Gadd’s family.“Chris’ passing is a devastating loss to his family, who knows all too well about the risk of public safety service. … Three members of their family proudly served within this profession,” Batiste said in a news conference Saturday.Gadd served two-and-a-half years as a trooper and is “survived by his wife, Cammryn, daughter Kaelyn, father WSP Trooper David Gadd, mother Gillian, sister, Jacqueline who currently serves as a trooper with the Texas Department of Public Safety,” the state patrol said in a Facebook post.“I can tell you that across the entire Washington State Patrol, every head is bowed, every knee is bent, and every heart is broken as we mourn this loss. To honor Chris, even in sorrow, we will go on. We will continue to serve. Because he did, we must,” Batiste said in the post.Gadd is the 33rd member of the state patrol to die in the line of duty over its 103-year history, the agency said.CNN’s Alisha Ebrahimji contributed to this report."

        "category": "us",
        "text": "A small plane crashed into the shoulder of Nashville’s Interstate 40 and burst into flames Monday night, killing a Canadian family of five, police said.Two adults and three children were on the plane, National Transportation Safety Board air safety investigator Aaron McCarter said Tuesday.The victims were identified as pilot Victor Dotsenko, 43, his wife, Rimma Dotsenko, 39, and their three children, David, 12; Adam, 10; and Emma, 7, the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said in a statement Wednesday.The plane was approved for an emergency landing at John C. Tune Airport after reporting engine and power failure around 7:40 p.m., Metro Nashville Police Department spokesperson Don Aaron said. But the pilot soon told air traffic control that they wouldn’t make it to the tarmac.Audio from the website LiveATC.net captured the communication between the pilot and the air traffic controller before the fatal crash.“Do you still have John Tune Airport in sight?” the air traffic controller asked.“My engine shut off. I’m at sixteen hundred [feet]. I’m going to be landing … I don’t know where,” the pilot responded.Witnesses reported the plane appeared to be “obviously in distress as it was coming over the interstate” before it crashed into a grassy area behind a Costco alongside I-40 east, Aaron said.“We are fortunate the aircraft did not hit any buildings as it went down,” Aaron said.The aircraft exploded into flames upon impact, Nashville Fire Department spokesperson Kendra Loney said.“That impact was catastrophic and did not leave any survivors,” Loney said.The family was from King Township, Ontario, just north of Toronto, Mayor Steve Pellegrini said Wednesday. The loss for the tight-knit community is “heartbreaking and devastating,” he added.“On behalf of King Township, I extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of the Dotsenko family from our community who tragically lost their lives in the small plane crash in Nashville, Tennessee,” Pellegrini said in a statement Monday.The NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the crash of the single-engine plane, the FAA said. The plane was a Piper PA-32, according to the NTSB.The plane originated in Ontario, Canada, and made stops in Erie, Pennsylvania, and Mount Sterling, Kentucky, “more than likely to pick up gas,” said McCarter, the NTSB investigator. The plane was headed to John Tune Airport in Nashville on Monday night but for unknown reasons passed over the airport at 2,500 feet, he said.The plane then made a U-turn, reported a complete loss of engine power and crashed into the side of the highway, he said.The crash prompted the temporary closure of I-40 east at mile marker 202, Tennessee Department of Transportation Region 3 spokeswoman Rebekah Hammonds said on X.Witness video shows an aircraft engulfed in flames and smoke, and images shared by police capture the aircraft’s mangled frame surrounded by first responders on a grassy roadside.Live traffic cameras also showed a large emergency vehicle response blocking all eastbound travel lanes near the crash site and a string of gridlocked traffic leading up to the shut-down stretch of I-40 east."

        "title": "8 teens were shot waiting for a bus after school in Northeast Philadelphia, police say as they hunt for suspects who fled",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "At least eight high school students were shot Wednesday afternoon in a hail of gunfire while waiting at a transit bus stop in Northeast Philadelphia, authorities said in a news conference – the second time in a week young people in the city were shot en route to or from school.The students, ages 15 to 17, were waiting just before 3 p.m. at the bus stop when three people got out of a car around the corner, walked up and fired at them at least 30 times, then fled, the police commissioner said. A 16-year-old was shot nine times, police said, while among all injured were leg, arm, back and upper-body wounds.Authorities were still hunting Thursday afternoon for the three “armed and dangerous” suspects who got out of the car, plus its driver, they said at a news conference. They are conducting forensic testing on a blue Hyundai Sonata believed to have been involved, said Frank Vanore, Philadelphia Police deputy commissioner of investigations.It’s not clear whether the gunfire was related to a deadly Monday afternoon shooting in which Philadelphia schoolchildren also were victims, Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel told reporters Wednesday, even as year-to-date homicides in the city are down about 30% and far below the highs of the pandemic years, police statistics show.“If they are connected – and I don’t know if they are – we want to end this dispute very quickly,” Vanore said.The incidents come as the United States grapples with an ongoing gun violence epidemic, particularly among youth. Firearms are now the No. 1 killer of children and teens in America, having surpassed motor vehicle accidents, which had been the leading cause of death among America’s youth until 2020.The attacks also are among 71 mass shootings reported in the United States in the first 66 days of this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which tallies those in which four people, not including shooters, are hit by gunfire.The three suspects in Wednesday’s shooting in Philadelphia got out of a car and ran up behind the Northeast High School students, some wearing backpacks, according to surveillance video posted by police on X. Gunfire then erupted before the three retreated into the car, which drove off – all within about 10 seconds.Police found 34 shell casings at the scene from three handguns, Vanore said.The edited police video shows zoomed-in stills of each of the three suspects, saying all are males with thin builds. Each wore a mask, according to the video captions, which describe the clothing of each assailant; there is no description of the driver.In pouring rain, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker and Bethel vowed to roll out more law enforcement resources to fight back against this type of gun violence.“It is hard to sit here and see in three days … 11 juveniles shot who were going and coming to school,” Bethel said. “The cowardly acts that we’ve seen over the last three days are unacceptable.”Wednesday’s eight gunshot victims include two 15-year-olds, five 16-year-olds and a 17-year-old; one is a girl, Philadelphia police said in a news release. The teen shot nine times remains in critical condition, while the others are stable, police said Thursday.Two Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority buses also were struck by gunfire, according to a spokesperson. No one on the buses was injured.The mayor assured residents that city officials will do everything they can to ensure the public’s safety. “And we don’t apologize for using every legal and constitutional tool in our tool belt in order to get that done,” Parker added.In Monday’s shooting, one teen was killed, two other teens were injured, and two women on a bus were hit by bullets in a shooting police labeled as “targeted.”Investigators are also combing tips from the public and social media to figure out what may have led to Wednesday’s shooting.“There’s some kind of dispute that happened before – we don’t know where, we don’t know how – and it led to this violence,” Vanore said.“The downstream impacts if we do not address gun violence and we do not address guns is what we see today,” Bethel said. “As a result of what we’ve seen over the past three days, we are going to be ramping up our resources significantly.”Transit police and Philadelphia police are working together on the investigation.CNN’s Danny Freeman reported from Philadelphia and Steve Almasy reported and wrote in Atlanta. CNN’s Alisha Ebrahimji, Michelle Watson and Yan Kaner contributed to this report."

        "text": "Within a year of calling off his last wedding, nonagenarian billionaire Rupert Murdoch has popped the question to another partner, months after they started dating.The former News Corp chairman’s media representative confirmed the news to CNN on Friday, just days before the billionaire’s 93rd birthday next Monday.It’s the second time Murdoch has been engaged in a year. Last March, the media titan announced plans to marry Ann Lesley Smith, a former dental hygienist and conservative radio host. But the wedding was called off weeks later.This time, Murdoch will wed Elena Zhukova, a 67-year-old retired molecular biologist, according to The New York Times, which first reported the impending nuptials.Murdoch and Zhukova reportedly started dating in the summer and plan to marry at Moraga Bel Air, Murdoch’s luxury vineyard and estate in California.Images of the couple together have been published in recent months on news sites. Zhukova is the mother of Russian American art collector Dasha Zhukova, the former wife of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.Murdoch was recently listed as #280 on Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index, with a net worth of $9 billion.He stepped down as chairman of News Corporation, the print publishing arm of his media empire, last November, handing control of the business to his eldest son, Lachlan.At the time, Murdoch said he would continue an “active role” in the company, adopting the title of chairman emeritus of Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News and other broadcasting assets.Murdoch was previously married to former flight attendant Patricia Booker, journalist Anna Murdoch and entrepreneur Wendi Deng, who reportedly introduced him to Zhukova.He married his fourth wife, former model Jerry Hall, in 2016. Their divorce was finalized in August 2022.It’s unclear why Murdoch’s last engagement was called off.At the time, he said of the proposal to Smith: “I was very nervous … “I dreaded falling in love – but I knew this would be my last. It better be. I’m happy.”Murdoch’s office did not reply to a request for further information on the timing and location of his upcoming wedding."

        "title": "With new plans, Colorado River states draw battle lines over who should bear the brunt of future water cuts",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "Seven Western states are starting to plot a future for how much water they’ll draw from the dwindling Colorado River in a warmer, drier world.The river is the lifeblood for the West – providing drinking water for tens of millions, irrigating crops, and powering homes and industry with hydroelectric dams.After water levels at the nation’s two largest reservoirs – lakes Powell and Mead – dropped precipitously in 2021 and 2022, the states got a huge reprieve during the record winter snowpack in 2022. Farmers, tribes and cities are also using less water, bolstered both by wetter conditions and federal cash for water cutbacks.This has bought states more time to figure out how to divvy up the river after 2026, when the current operating guidelines expire.To that end, the four upper basin river states of Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming submitted their proposal for how future cuts should be divvied up among the seven states to the federal government on Tuesday, and the three lower basin states of California, Arizona and Nevada submitted their plan on Wednesday.One thing is clear from the competing plans: The two groups of states do not agree so far on who should bear the brunt of future cuts if water levels drop in the Colorado River basin.It’s a pressing problem as the river shrinks; scientists estimate Colorado River flows have decreased by about 20% compared to the early 20th century. A 2023 UCLA study found rising temperatures from climate change had sucked more than 10 trillion gallons of water out of the river basin in just the last two decades alone – a volume about the size of Lake Mead itself.“We must plan for the river we have – not the river we dream for,” Becky Mitchell, Colorado’s commissioner to the Upper Colorado River Commission, said in a statement.Both plans envision maximum water cuts of nearly 4 million acre-feet per year under a worst-case scenario where water levels crater across the basin. But the crux of the disagreement between the two groups hinges on whether all seven states should be expected to contribute cuts.The upper basin proposal puts mandatory cuts on the three lower basin states if Lake Mead falls to a certain threshold, while offering the four upper basin states would also undertake voluntary reductions. It does not, however, provide specific water cut commitments for those voluntary reductions.The four-state plan “seeks to acknowledge the upper basin’s realities, including hydrologic shortages, protect upper basin interests, and contribute towards future sustainability of the entire basin,” Estevan Lopez, New Mexico’s commissioner on the Upper Colorado River Commission, said in a statement.Meanwhile, the lower basin plan proposes monitoring water levels in seven different reservoirs across the upper and lower basins, including the Flaming Gorge Reservoir and lakes Havasu and Mohave, in addition to Mead and Powell, to determine when cuts would be necessary.If water levels across the seven reservoirs were to drop below 69%, the lower basin plan has California, Arizona and Nevada taking the brunt of cuts. If, however, water levels across the system were to drop below 38%, the lower basin plan would spread cuts ranging between 1.5 million to 3.9 million acre-feet across all seven states, plus the country of Mexico – which also uses river water.“That is where we think the entire basin needs to be on deck and contributing,” said John Entsminger, the general manager for the Southern Nevada Water Authority. “Literally every water user across seven states and two countries needs to be part of the solution if we’re in that operating regime.”It’s been more than 20 years since water levels were high enough to prevent water cuts under the proposed stipulations of the lower basin plan. Water levels at reservoirs across the Colorado basin started to fall in the mid-2000s and have never fully recovered.Arizona’s top water official Tom Buschatzke told reporters Wednesday the upper basin plan “basically puts the entire burden of protecting the river system” on California, Arizona and Nevada.“They take no reductions under any circumstances, as I understand the proposal,” Buschatzke said. “What I need to see out of the upper basin is a proposal in which they help contribute to the protection of the river system in a way that has certainty.”The federal government and its Bureau of Reclamation – the agency responsible for managing the West’s complex system of reservoirs, rivers and dams – has legal authority over the lower basin but not the upper basin under the current law of the river. But California’s top Colorado River negotiator JB Hamby said that reality shouldn’t give upper basin states an out from sharing in future reductions.“Arguing legal interpretations until we’re blue in the face doesn’t do anything to proactively respond to climate change,” Hamby told reporters. “I think there’s two different ways that this whole problem has been approached; one has been PR and lawyering, the other has been collaboration and compromise.”The current negotiation is a continuation of several years of tense talks between the seven states. States scrambled to figure out how to dole out short-term cuts as Mead and Powell levels plummeted suddenly in 2021 and 2022 – a product of overuse colliding with a climate change-fueled megadrought across the West.California – the river’s largest water user – found itself isolated during that fight, as the six other states banded together. Ultimately, the lower basin states forged a landmark short-term deal.New battle lines are being drawn, but some states urged everyone to come back to the negotiating table to hash out a compromise all seven states could agree on, and the federal government will eventually approve.“I know the sexy headline is going to be four versus three states on the brink, but we are at one step in this process,” Entsminger said, noting the final decision isn’t due until the end of 2026.“While there is a very large gap between the upper basin and the lower basin proposal, I believe it is incumbent upon the seven governor’s representatives to get back to the table in the spirit of shared sacrifice and bridge that gap.”"

        "title": "What federal judges have said about Florida’s ‘Stop Woke Act’",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is exploring options for his office to appeal a federal court’s decision to block part of the state’s Individual Freedom Act, also known as the “Stop WOKE Act.”In a ruling filed Monday, the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court’s ruling that parts of the legislation infringe on an employer’s free speech rights.The law was one of several bills the Republican governor signed in 2022 as part of his war on “woke ideology.”“Yesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that companies have a right to indoctrinate their employees with racist and discriminatory ideologies,” DeSantis’ office said in a statement on Tuesday.“We disagree with the Court’s opinion that employers can require employees to be taught — as a condition of employment — that one race is morally superior to another race. The First Amendment protects no such thing, and the State of Florida should have every right to protect Floridians from racially hostile workplaces. We are reviewing all options on appeal going forward.”In August 2022, US District Court Judge Mark E. Walker issued an injunction that blocked Florida from enforcing parts of the law prohibiting mandatory workplace activities and trainings that suggest a person is privileged or oppressed based on their race, color, sex or national origin.Walker wrote in the ruling that the Stop WOKE Act, “discriminates on the basis of viewpoint in violation of the First Amendment and is impermissibly vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.”On Monday, a panel of three appeals court judges upheld Walker’s decision.Eleventh Circuit Appeals Judge Britt Grant, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, issued the opinion, writing that the court rejects “this latest attempt to control speech by recharacterizing it as conduct.”“Florida may be exactly right about the nature of the ideas it targets. Or it may not. Either way, the merits of these views will be decided in the clanging marketplace of ideas rather than a codebook or a courtroom,” Grant wrote. Here’s what federal judges have said about Florida’s Stop WOKE Act.In the opening lines of his August 2022 decision, Judge Walker compares Florida’s interpretation of the First Amendment to the “parallel dimension” in the Netflix TV series, “Stranger Things” – The Upside Down.“Recently, Florida has seemed like a First Amendment upside down,” Walker wrote in the opinion, adding that typically the First Amendment prevents the state from limiting, or “burdening,” free speech.“But in Florida, the First Amendment apparently bars private actors from burdening speech, while the state may burden speech freely. “Now, like the heroine in Stranger Things, this Court is once again asked to pull Florida back from the upside down,” Walker, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote.Walker ruled that “the First Amendment does not give the state license to censor speech because it finds it ‘repugnant,’ no matter how captive the audience.”Judge Grant, who authored the 11th Circuit’s opinion on behalf of the appellate panel, also found the Florida law infringes on First Amendment rights.“By limiting its restrictions to a list of ideas designated as offensive, the Act targets speech based on its content,” Grant wrote. “And by barring only speech that endorses any of those ideas, it penalizes certain viewpoints — the greatest First Amendment sin.”“The answer is clear: Florida’s law exceeds the bounds of the First Amendment. No matter how controversial the ideas, allowing the government to set the terms of the debate is poison, not antidote,” the opinion said.Attorneys defending the Stop WOKE Act have drawn comparisons between the law and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects against workplace discrimination.In Monday’s ruling, Grant described that argument as “a last-ditch effort.”“According to Florida, because the Individual Freedom Act, like Title VII, seeks to regulate discrimination, the two statutes rise and fall together—if one is unconstitutional, the other must be too,” Grant wrote.“We disagree. Having similar asserted purposes does not make the two laws the same.”The ruling emphasized that the Florida law was problematic because restricting speech was the point of the law, unlike Title VII, which was not directed at restricting speech.The judges also noted the Stop WOKE Act only protects the speech and concepts that are approved by Florida.“The only way to discern which mandatory trainings are prohibited is to find out whether the speaker disagrees with Florida. That is a classic—and disallowed—regulation of speech,” Grant wrote.“Banning speech on a wide variety of political topics is bad; banning speech on a wide variety of political viewpoints is worse. A government’s desire to protect the ears of its residents ‘is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression,’” Grant said.Grant also wrote that Florida’s law would prohibit free speech, “even when no one listening finds it offensive.”“That is to say, it keeps both willing and unwilling listeners from hearing certain perspectives—for every one person who finds these viewpoints offensive, there may be another who welcomes them.”Walker also noted in his August 2022 ruling, “If Florida truly believes we live in a post-racial society, then let it make its case.”“But it cannot win the argument by muzzling its opponents,” he said."

        "text": "The manslaughter trial of James Crumbley, the father of the teenager who killed four students at a Michigan high school in 2021, began with opening statements Thursday, just weeks after his wife, Jennifer, was convicted of the same charges.James Crumbley was “grossly negligent,” Oakland County Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Marc Keast said in openings, because he purchased the murder weapon for his son four days before the attack and failed to secure it even though he knew his son was in a downward spiral.“That nightmare was preventable and it was foreseeable,” Keast said.For the defense’s opening statement, Mariell Lehman pleaded ignorance on her client’s behalf. She said Crumbley did not know his son had gained access to the weapon and did not believe there was an imminent, immediate threat of danger.“You will not hear that James Crumbley knew what his son was going to do,” she said. “You will not hear that James Crumbley even suspected that his son was a danger.”James Crumbley has pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter in the November 30, 2021, mass shooting at Oxford High School, in which his son Ethan killed four students and wounded six students and a teacher. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted.This case, like the one against his wife, is set to test the limits of who is responsible for a mass shooting. Prosecutors aiming to expand the scope of blame in mass shootings have used an unusual and novel legal strategy by arguing the shooter’s parents are responsible for the deaths because they got him a gun and disregarded signs of his mental health issues.Parents have previously faced liability for their child’s actions, such as with neglect or firearms charges. Still, Jennifer Crumbley’s case was the first time a parent of a school shooter was held directly responsible for the killings.Some legal experts, including Jennifer Crumbley’s defense attorney, expressed concern that these cases could be a dangerous precedent for parents everywhere. Anticipating that argument, Keast said in his opening statement Thursday that no parent is responsible for everything their child does.“But in a situation where the father was in a position to reasonably foresee what the son was going to do, because the father armed him four days before and was shown a clear statement of intent of what the son was going to do, that’s when that rare set of circumstances are present in that specific set of facts,” he said.The Crumbleys’ son Ethan pleaded guilty to one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other charges related to the deadly rampage. He was sentenced last year to life in prison without parole. He did not testify in his mother’s trial, as his attorneys had said he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence if called.Jury selection took place Tuesday and Wednesday as attorneys asked potential jurors whether they could be fair and impartial in the high-profile trial and questioned their beliefs about guns, parenting and mental health. A jury made up of six men and nine women was ultimately selected, and the judge will randomly divide the group into 12 jurors and three alternates prior to deliberations.The case against James Crumbley is likely to be altogether similar to the one against his wife, featuring testimony from the same shooting survivors, police investigators and school employees.For example, the first witness to testify Thursday in James’ trial was Molly Darnell, a teacher who was shot in the shoulder and survived. She was also the first witness in Jennifer Crumbley’s trial.But there are some key differences between the two cases, particularly in each parent’s firearm expertise and knowledge about Ethan’s mental health problems. Plus, this is a wholly separate trial, meaning there will be a different jury, evidentiary rulings and legal strategies.The basic facts and allegations, introduced as evidence at Jennifer’s trial, are mostly the same for each parent. Both Jennifer and James Crumbley gave their 15-year-old son a firearm as an early Christmas present and took him to the gun range multiple times.According to Ethan’s texts and journal entries, they both were dismissive of his mental health struggles and requests for help.They both were made aware of Ethan’s disturbing drawings on a worksheet, including a gun, a person bleeding, and the phrases “the thoughts won’t stop help me,” and “blood everywhere,” on the morning of the shooting. And they both were present at a pivotal meeting with school counselors that same day, during which they declined to take their son home from school and did not mention his new gun or his mental health issues. Ethan had secretly hidden the gun in his backpack, and less than two hours after the meeting, he took it out and opened fire on schoolmates.Finally, after the shooting, the two fled town, sparking a manhunt that ended in a late-night raid at a Detroit warehouse.Yet there are a few key differences. For one, James was the parent who purchased the SIG Sauer 9mm firearm for their son at a gun range on Black Friday and was the registered owner of the firearm, according to receipts. He also was more familiar with firearms and, according to his wife, was the parent in charge of securing the home’s three weapons. “It was more his thing, so I let him handle that,” she testified.Secondly, the case heavily relies on what the parents knew about Ethan’s mental health issues, and several pieces of evidence from Jennifer’s text messages may not apply to James. For example, Jennifer was the parent who heard from a school official the day before the shooting that Ethan had been searching on his phone for ammo. She later texted her son, “LOL I’m not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught,” according to text records.How much did James know about that and other incidents, and will there be texts to prove it?“(Jennifer’s) case lived and died on foreseeability. Was this foreseeable?” trial attorney Misty Marris, who is not involved in the cases but has closely followed them, told CNN. “What somebody knows and when is going to be critical to that (foreseeability).”Third, the prosecution in Jennifer’s trial portrayed her as an inattentive mother, introducing evidence of her extramarital affair and her deep interest in her horses. The evidence of James’ personal issues presumably will be different.There are also potential differences in James’ legal strategy and whether he testifies.At her trial, Jennifer Crumbley’s defense pushed blame onto her husband for failing to secure the firearm, on the school for failing to notify her about Ethan’s behavioral issues and on her son for planning and carrying out the heinous shooting. On the stand, she dismissed texts about her son seeing hallucinations, saying they were just jokes, and explicitly said she had no regret for her actions.“I’ve asked myself if I would have done anything differently, and I wouldn’t have,” she testified.Jennifer Crumbley’s defense and the prosecution were barred from speaking publicly about her case until the end of James Crumbley’s trial."

        "category": "us",
        "text": "A preliminary report published Friday morning shows three people were killed Thursday evening in a fiery crash when a small plane smashed into a mobile home park in Clearwater, Florida.The Federal Aviation Administration’s report lists three fatalities, one among the flight crew and two people inside the home. The crash happened at 7:27 p.m. ET on Thursday.The FAA notes the “aircraft crashed under unknown circumstances into a mobile home park,” and reports there was a “post crash fire.”The only occupant in the plane was the pilot, the FAA said.At least nine people were inside the mobile home earlier Thursday night, but only two remained at the time of the crash, the Clearwater Fire and Rescue Department said in a news release.Firefighters responded to the crash site at the Bayside Waters mobile home park, Fire Chief Scott Ehlers said Thursday during a news briefing. They found four trailer homes on fire – one of which had the crashed plane inside, Ehlers said.The plane was found “predominantly” in one mobile home, the fire chief said Thursday. Crews were still trying to tame hot spots and reach the bodies of those who died, Ehlers added.“Our thoughts are with the three victims and their families; this tragedy could have been even worse,” Clearwater Police Chief Eric Gandy said.Clearwater resident Steven Ascari told CNN he heard what sounded like an explosion Thursday evening that shook his apartment.“And next thing you know, a giant pillar of smoke was seen,” he said in a message.As officials received a call about a fire at the mobile home park, there was a report at the same time of a plane experiencing an emergency at an airport, Ehlers said Thursday. The plane ultimately went off radar about 3 miles north of a runway, the same location as the mobile home park.The aircraft, a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza V35, crashed into the residential area after the pilot reported an engine failure, an FAA spokesperson told CNN. The plane had taken off earlier on Thursday from Vero Beach, officials said.Audio from LiveATC.net recorded the pilot saying shortly before the crash, “I’m losing engine.”Unidentified pilots on air traffic control communication feeds are then heard saying, “They just hit the ground really hard with the plane,” and “They’re in flames.” Another is heard to say, “It looks like they went into a house.”A National Transportation Safety Board preliminary report says in part, “According to two individuals who were at CLW, the pilot broadcast on the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) that he could not find the airport and asked them to turn on the runway lights which were already on from an airplane that had just landed. They also stated that after the pilot requested a second time to turn the runway lights on, the pilot-controlled runway lighting was changed to the highest intensity. Both individuals then heard the pilot announce had a ‘fire.’”The other mobile homes that were ablaze have been cleared, and there were no victims there, the fire chief said Thursday night.Clearwater, home to more than 110,000 people, is about 23 miles west of Tampa on Florida’s central west coast."

        "category": "us",
        "text": "A Saudi Arabian farm previously permitted to pump unlimited amounts of groundwater to grow alfalfa for dairy cows overseas has stopped irrigating its crops on state land in Arizona’s Butler Valley, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs announced Thursday.Hobbs and the Arizona State Land Department announced after a recent inspection Fondomonte had stopped pumping water in the Butler Valley groundwater basin and has begun to take steps to leave the property.Hobbs took full credit for the outcome, saying it was a result of her move to terminate and decline to renew Fondomonte’s leases on state land in the area, part of a broader crackdown from Hobbs and her Democratic attorney general Kris Mayes.“Today is the start of a new chapter for Arizona’s water future,” Hobbs said in a statement. “I’m not afraid to hold people accountable, maximize value for the state land trust, and protect Arizona’s water security.”Arizona’s State Land Department used to lease thousands of acres to Fondomonte Arizona LLC, a farming operation owned by Middle East dairy giant Almarai Company, CNN previously reported. The state land department leased more than 6,000 acres to Fondomonte, it told CNN in 2022, making it the second-largest agricultural lessor of Arizona land.Fondomonte previously held four separate leases on state land in the Butler Valley Basin. In October, Arizona officials notified the company three of its four leases would not be renewed and the fourth had been canceled due to default.Besides the state lands it leased, the farm also owns land in both Arizona and California. The Almarai Company owns about 10,000 acres of farmland in Arizona under its subsidiary, Fondomonte. It also owns about 3,500 acres in agriculture-heavy Southern California, according to public land records, where they use Colorado River water to irrigate crops.Fondomonte’s lawyer did not immediately return CNN’s request for comment.Fondomonte is not the only foreign farm in the state. Al Dahra, a United Arab Emirates-based company farming alfalfa in the Southwest, also has operations in rural parts of the state. And several other corporate farms headquartered in other states have for years taken advantage of what Arizona residents and officials have long described as lax groundwater laws, allowing farms to pump unlimited water as long as they own or lease the property to drill wells into.When Mayes and Hobbs took office, they vowed to crack down on foreign-owned farms leasing land from the state with the benefit of unlimited water pumping. State and federal analyses have found some groundwater basins are being severely overpumped.Amid years of drought and a growing population in the state, Arizona officials have taken a number of steps to protect their water resources, including putting limits on new housing developments.Last year when announcing new restrictions on Fondomonte’s pumping, Mayes said the Arizona Department of Water Resources had revoked permits Fondomonte sought to drill wells capable of pumping 3,000 gallons of groundwater per minute.Such a rate of pumping is far more than what’s used in homes. According to state estimates, 325,000 gallons of water is enough for three average-size homes in Phoenix for a year.In her statement, Hobbs said she would “continue taking decisive action to protect Arizona’s water so we can thrive for generations to come.”"

        "category": "us",
        "text": "The stepmother of 5-year-old Harmony Montgomery, the missing girl who authorities said was killed in New Hampshire in 2019, was granted parole Thursday morning, video from her parole hearing shows.Kayla Montgomery, whose estranged husband Adam Montgomery was found guilty last month of second-degree murder in Harmony’s death, pleaded guilty in 2022 to lying to a grand jury about when and where she was at the time her stepdaughter was last seen, according to the parole hearing and court records.The father was also found guilty of second-degree assault, witness tampering, falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse, according to court proceedings.Harmony was reported missing in November 2021 by her mother, Crystal Sorey, who said she last saw the girl during a FaceTime call in the spring of 2019. Police said Harmony was last seen in October 2019.Authorities concluded in August 2022 the girl had been slain in Manchester, New Hampshire, in December 2019. Her remains have not been found.Montgomery was indicted in January 2023 by a New Hampshire grand jury, accusing him of “repeatedly striking Harmony Montgomery on the head with a closed fist,” causing her death.Montgomery destroyed, concealed or hid Harmony’s body between December 7, 2019, and March 4, 2020, preventing authorities from conducting a proper investigation, state Attorney General John Formella said in 2022.Formella said Montgomery purposely attempted to “induce or otherwise cause” Kayla Montgomery to falsely testify in the investigation into Harmony’s disappearance between December 7, 2019, and January 4, 2022.During her Thursday court hearing, Kayla Montgomery was in tears as she acknowledged she lied, emphasizing being honest about what happened “takes a lot of weight off you.“It’s better to tell the truth and be honest so that everything else can come to light,” she said.The stepmother said detectives could have “done their jobs sooner” in finding Harmony and finding answers about what happened to the child if she were honest all along.The state’s parole board approved Kayla Montgomery’s parole at the morning hearing, telling her to complete all required programs and establish a home plan before she is released in May.The board also imposed 90 days of supervision and ordered her to take part in addiction recovery and mental health treatments.CNN’s Nicki Brown and Nic F. Anderson contributed to this report."

        "title": "Former compounding pharmacy owner linked to deadly 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak pleads no contest to involuntary manslaughter",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "Barry Cadden, the former owner of a Massachusetts compounding pharmacy linked to a deadly 2012 multistate fungal meningitis outbreak, pleaded no contest Monday to 11 counts of involuntary manslaughter relating to the Michigan residents who died from contaminated drugs, prosecutors said.More than 100 people died across the US, federal prosecutors have said. Among them, at least 11 Michigan residents who received injection treatments that were compounded and produced at the New England Compounding Center (NECC), which Cadden owned, according to a news release from the Michigan Department of Attorney General Dana Nessel.The drug those residents were injected with was contaminated, the attorney general’s office said.“Cadden ran his pharmaceutical lab with a shocking and abhorrent disregard for basic safety rules and practices, and in doing so he tragically killed eleven Michigan patients,” Nessel said in a statement. “Patients must be able to trust their medications are safe, and doctors must be assured they aren’t administering deadly poison.”Cadden will have to serve between 10 to 15 years in prison, which will run concurrently with a federal sentence he’s already serving in connection with the outbreak, the release said. CNN was not able to reach an attorney for Cadden. His sentencing is scheduled for April 18.Nearly 800 people in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection in 2012 after receiving injections from contaminated vials of medicine manufactured by the NECC, the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts has said.The outbreak became the “largest public health crisis ever caused by a contaminated pharmaceutical drug,” the US attorney’s office said.Bruce Singal, an attorney for Cadden, told CNN in 2017 their “thoughts and prayers” were with the outbreak victims and added he had “nothing more to say.”Compounding pharmacists customize medications to fit an individual’s needs, and compounding pharmacies usually make only a couple of doses for a specific patient, which can lower the cost of production, CNN has previously reported.The Michigan attorney general said Cadden “disregarded sterility procedures … and ran his business in an egregiously unsafe manner, endorsing laboratory directives wherein cleaning records and scientific testing results were regularly forced and fabricated.”Cadden directed and authorized shipments of contaminated methylprednisolone acetate, a preservative-free steroid, to customers across the US, Massachusetts prosecutors said in 2021. He authorized the drug shipments before they were confirmed to be sterile, did not notify customers when they were not sterile, and compounded drugs with expired ingredients, the US Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts said.“Cadden also repeatedly took steps to shield NECC’s operations from regulatory oversight by the FDA by claiming to be a pharmacy dispensing drugs pursuant to valid, patient-specific prescriptions,” the office said in their 2021 release. “NECC routinely dispensed drugs in bulk without valid prescriptions. NECC even used fictional and celebrity names on fake prescriptions to dispense drugs, such as ‘Michael Jackson,’ ‘Freddie Mae’ and ‘Diana Ross.’”In 2017, Cadden was sentenced to nine years in prison after he was convicted in federal court of more than 50 charges – including racketeering and racketeering conspiracy. He was resentenced in 2021 to 14.5 years in prison and ordered to pay forfeiture of $1.4 million and restitution of $82 million, according to a news release from the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts.More than a dozen people linked to the compounding pharmacy have been convicted in connection with the outbreak, CNN has reported.Among them, a former co-owner, vice president and general manager of the compounding pharmacy, who was convicted in 2018 of conspiring to defraud the United States and sentenced to one year in prison and one year of supervised release, CNN has reported.A former supervisory pharmacist was also resentenced in 2021 to 10.5 years in prison and three years of supervised release and ordered to pay more than $470,000 forfeiture and $82 million restitution after he was convicted of more than 70 federal charges, including racketeering and racketeering conspiracy, according to the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts.The NECC and several affiliated companies reached a $200 million settlement in 2015 with the victims and their families across the US – and $10.5 million was designated for the Michigan victims and their families, according to the news release from Nessel’s office."

        "title": "The Rivian R2 and R3 are Rivian’s smaller, more affordable off-road EVs",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "Rivian, the electric vehicle startup known for its of-road capable truck and SUV models, has unveiled two new, more affordable SUVs that the company hopes will take its sales to a new level.Currently, Rivian sells only two models, the big R1T SUV and the the R1S pickup, priced starting around $70,000 and $75,000, respectively. The new SUVs, called the R2 and R3, will be smaller and much less expensive.Prices for the R2 SUV, which will go on sale in early 2026, will start at around $45,000, Rivian said. At that price, it will still be relatively costly but it’s at least closer to an entry-level luxury vehicle, rather than at the high end.The R3 will cost even less than the R2, but Rivian didn’t provide any more specific pricing for that model. It will also be smaller, about 5 inches shorter, front to back, than the R2 and with a more sloped rear profile.The R2 is roughly the length of a Chevrolet Equinox, and neither the R2 and R3 will have a third row of seats. That’s something that set the larger R1S apart among electric SUVs, few of which can seat more than five.The new SUVs will be available in single-motor versions, which will have rear-wheel-drive. There will also be all-wheel-drive versions with either two or three motors. Three-motor versions will be able to accelerate from a stop to 60 miles an hour in under three seconds, according to Rivian. The R3 will be offered in a special high-performance model called the R3X.Although Rivian did not disclose specific performance numbers for the R3X, chief executive R.J. Scaringe described it as something like an off-road rally racing car.“It’s not a rock crawling vehicle, but it’s more of a a higher speed type of vehicle,” he said in an interview with CNN. “You do trails and exploring, but it’s a very high performance vehicle.”When purchased with larger optional battery packs, the R2 and R3 will be able to go over 300 miles on a full charge, according to Rivian. The SUVs will be able to fast-charge on either Tesla’s NACS chargers, or on the current industry standard CCS chargers. Like most other automakers, Rivian is planning to switch to the Tesla standard.In announcing the new vehicles, Scaringe also mentioned that plans for opening a second factory in Georgia, something the company had originally announced in 2021, were being postponed. He did not say how long those plans would be delayed, though.“The Georgia site still very much as part of our our strategy,” Scaringe said in an interview after new vehicles were unveiled.Rivian’s stock rose more than 13% Thursday. The stock had tumbled recently when the EV maker announced that 2024 sales wouldn’t be much higher than 2023 sales had been, at around 50,000 units. These new models, which won’t go on sale until at least the first half of 2026, won’t do anything to change that in the short term.And by moving into a lower price range, Rivian isn’t really avoiding competition, noted Sandeep Rao, an industry analyst with Leverage Shares, in an interview with CNN.Those in the middle and upper income segments of the US EV market are “spoiled for choices,” he said.“For $75,000 I can buy a Mercedes or a BMW, a 100-year-old Europe power house,” he said. “At 40,000, I can buy a Tesla.”Rivian will also face higher-end electric SUVs from Kia and Hyundai. But Rivian can set itself apart with vehicles that are actually capable of fairly serious off-road driving, something most electric SUVs don’t even pretend to be able to handle.But competition is coming, even on forest trails, as Volkswagen Group’s new Scout EV brand is almost directly aimed at Rivian’s customers. Scout, which recently started construction on a factory in South Carolina, expects to begin delivering its own off-road-capable electric truck and SUV models, priced close to the Rivian R2, in 2026, as well.Without naming Rivian, Scout chief executive Scott Keogh noted the advantage of Scout’s established brand name. “Scout” was the model name of an early SUV made by International Harvester, which was more typically known for heavy duty trucks and farm equipment.“Those who don’t know [the Scout name], when they do investigate it, that’s exactly what you want with a brand,” Keogh said in a recent CNN interview. “They say ‘Ah, look at the history! Look at the credibility, Look at the background,’ as opposed to a created name.”"

        "title": "Tennessee state lawmakers advance bill that could ban the LGBTQ Pride flag in schools",
        "category": "us",
        "text": "State lawmakers in Tennessee could soon pass a bill that would limit the types of flags that can be displayed in public schools, sparking outcry from LGBTQ advocates who say the measure is an attempt to ban the Pride flag and curtail free speech.The Tennessee state House advanced HB 1605 to the state Senate Thursday, an amendment to the Tennessee Code that sets out which flags can be displayed in schools. The new bill designates several types of flags that can be displayed, including the U.S. flag, the official Tennessee state flag, and any flag that is protected by the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act.Critics argue that including the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act in the amendment would allow the Confederate flag to be displayed, while banning the Pride flag.The Heritage Protection Act, which went into effect in 2013, states “no memorial regarding a historic conflict, historic entity, historic event … that is, or is located on, public property, may be removed, renamed, relocated, altered, rededicated, or otherwise disturbed or altered.”The law specifically notes memorials and flags dedicated to what some euphemistically call the “War Between the States,” but is historically known as the Civil War, cannot be removed. Although the law does not specifically name the Confederate flag, many critics have noted that it would be protected under the act.Tennessee state Rep. Gino Bulso, a Republican, said he introduced HB1605 last November after receiving complaints from parents in his district about the Pride flag and after contentious debates over whether the flag should be allowed in classrooms erupted during a local school board meeting.Last month, during a Tennessee House education subcommittee hearing, Bulso said the bill “does not allow any other flag beyond the 10 that are listed” to be displayed, adding that the ban also includes “flags that teachers are currently using to indoctrinate students in a particular set of values, including the Pride flag which is becoming more ubiquitous in schools.”Several people at the hearing groaned in response to Bulso’s claim that teachers were “indoctrinating” students by displaying the Pride flag.On the floor of the state house, Democratic State Rep. Justin Pearson called the bill “immoral and unjust” and proposed an unsuccessful amendment that would have banned Confederate flags from being displayed.Despite the criticism, Bulso remained undeterred.“[It] really addresses one issue, which is whether parents should be the ones who decide what values their children are exposed to when they go to school,” he said during the meeting of the house committee that debated and voted on the bill.If it passes, HB1605 would also give a parent or guardian of a student “standing to file a civil action” against public or charter schools to enforce the amendment.LGBTQ advocates and civil rights groups have criticized the amendment, calling it an attack on First Amendment rights and harmful to students.Chris Sanders, executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project and Tennessee Equality Project Foundation, told CNN the Pride flag “is a way of signaling to LGBTQ students that they are safe and accepted.”LGBTQ youth face higher bullying and discrimination rates than many of their peers Sanders said. “They need accepting adults in their lives and it’s better if they don’t have to guess who they are.“Furthermore, if a small group of parents wants power over what everyone else sees, then they can try to repeal the First Amendment. Otherwise, I fail to see how they have the right to control the speech and expression of others.”Democratic Tennessee state lawmakers have also pushed back on the bill.“What this bill is doing, per your words, is now saying things like the LGBTQ flag are now barred,” Tennessee state Rep. Sam McKenzie, a Democrat, said during a debate of the bill on the state House floor last week. “This is a horrible bill.”The effort to ban Pride flags in Tennessee comes amid a growing parental rights movement in the US that seeks to empower parents to decide what can be taught in classrooms about race, sexuality and gender.HB1605 is the latest in a series of anti-LGBTQ bills working their way through state legislatures across the country. In 2023, at least 510 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced in state legislatures, according to data from the American Civil Liberties Union.Tennessee and North Dakota tied for the most number of anti-LGBTQ bills passed, with 10 each.In June, attorneys for the state of Tennessee asked a federal appeals court to reverse a federal judge’s decision that a state law limiting public drag show performances was unconstitutional."

        "text": "Police are searching for three suspects who they say pulled up to a King City, California, house party and opened fire Sunday evening, killing at least four people and injuring three others.Three men died at the scene and a woman who was shot was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to King City Police Chief James Hunt.Three other people injured by gunshots were taken to a hospital for treatment, and their conditions were not released.The California house party adds to a troubling list of ordinary gatherings disrupted by gun violence in America this weekend:The incident in California also extends the list of at least 68 mass shootings in the country so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.Police say that the shooting occurred when a vehicle pulled up to the residence in King City, located about 62 miles southeast of Monterey.Three masked men exited and began shooting at the people attending the party in the front yard, before getting back into the car and fleeing the scene, according to police.Police are still looking for the three suspects who were wearing dark-colored clothing and masks."

        "text": "Last month was the planet’s hottest February on record, marking the ninth month in a row that global records tumbled, according to new data from Copernicus, the European Union’s climate monitoring service.February was 1.77 degrees Celsius warmer than the average February in pre-industrial times, Copernicus found, and it capped off the hottest 12-month period in recorded history, at 1.56 degrees above pre-industrial levels.It’s yet another grim climate change milestone, as the long-term impacts of human-caused global warming are given a boost by El Niño, a natural climate fluctuation.“February joins the long streak of records of the last few months. As remarkable as this might appear, it is not really surprising as the continuous warming of the climate system inevitably leads to new temperature extremes,” Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus, said in a statement.Even in the context of back-to-back months of unprecedented temperatures, February has been extreme.Global temperatures in the first half of the month in particular were “exceptionally high,” according to the analysis. Four consecutive days, from February 8 to 11, were 2 degrees warmer than those same days pre-industrial times.Restricting global heating to well below 2 degrees was a centerpiece of the Paris Agreement that almost every country signed up to in 2015. While scientists are much more concerned with longer-term warming, these temporary breaches are a clear and alarming sign of accelerating heating.Global ocean temperatures were also off the charts last month, hitting 21.06 degrees — the highest average for any month on record, according to the Copernicus data, beating the previous record of 20.98 degrees set in August 2023.Experts have expressed shock at just how hot the oceans have been, especially the North Atlantic, which has set a new daily temperature record every day since March 5 last year, according to Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.“At times, the records have been broken by margins that are virtually statistically impossible,” McNoldy told CNN.Record ocean heat has significant global impacts. Not only is it dangerous for marine life but it also fuels extreme weather, including scorching heat waves, intense rainfall and ferocious hurricanes.The Copernicus data “tells a familiar story of warming temperatures and shifting patterns of weather,” said Hannah Cloke, a climate scientist and professor at the University of Reading in the UK. It is entirely consistent with what scientists have predicted would happen “as greenhouse gases continue to build up in our thin, life-giving atmosphere,” she told CNN.It provides yet more evidence that the world needs to reduce emissions drastically and immediately, Cloke said.If this evidence is ignored, Cloke added, “our children’s generation, and all those that follow, will be justified in pointing to the people who lived in 2024 and cursing our reckless stupidity.”CNN’s Derek Van Dam contributed to this report."

        "text": "A Russian missile exploded close to a convoy carrying Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis during a deadly attack on the Black Sea port city of Odesa on Wednesday.The group felt the impact of the strike and saw a “mushroom cloud” of smoke, according to a source familiar with the situation, who put the location of the strike around 500 meters from the convoy.Five people were killed in the strike and more were wounded, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, Dmytro Pletenchuk, told CNN, though neither Zelensky or Mitsotakis were injured.Zelensky frequently makes high-risk trips to the front lines and has welcomed dozens of world leaders to Ukraine over more than two years of war with Russia, but Wednesday’s attack may represent one of the closest calls for the president. The strike’s proximity to Mitsotakis - the leader of a NATO member state - also underlines the dangers of such visits and potential global repercussions of the conflict.Zelensky said he was close enough to see and hear the strike.“We saw this strike today. You can see who we are dealing with, they don’t care where they strike. I know that there were victims today, I don’t know all the details yet, but I know that there are dead and wounded,” Zelensky said from Odesa on Wednesday.“We need to defend ourselves first and foremost. The best way to do that is with an air defense system,” he added.Mitsotakis said Zelensky had given him a tour of the southern city, which has sustained huge damage from months of Russian strikes, before they heard air raid sirens.“Shortly after, as we were getting into our cars, we heard a big explosion,” Mitsotakis told reporters later Wednesday. “I think that for us is the best, most vivid reminder that there is a real war going on here. Every day there is a war, which not only affects the front, the soldiers, it affects our innocent fellow citizens.”Odesa lies at the mouth of the Danube River and is crucial for Ukraine’s grain exports, which Russia has repeatedly tried to stem since launching its invasion. It is also the main base of Ukraine’s navy.Russia’s Defense Ministry said its military had conducted the strike at 11.40 a.m. Moscow time (3.40 a.m. ET).“The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation launched a high-precision missile attack on a hangar in the industrial port district of Odesa, where preparations were underway for the combat use of unmanned boats of the armed forces of Ukraine. The target of the strike has been achieved. The object is hit,” it said in a statement, without mentioning Zelensky or Mitsotakis.Russia has stepped up its strikes on the region in recent days, and on Saturday a Russian drone attack on an apartment block in the city killed 12 people, including five children, Ukrainian officials said.Zelensky said the attack pressed home the need to further strengthen the country’s air defenses.He has often argued that Western leaders need to visit Ukraine to understand the reality of Russia’s ongoing aggression.Speaking after Wednesday’s strike, Zelensky said he had welcomed Mitsotakis to “honor the memory” of those killed in Sunday’s attack and urged his allies to provide more support.“The world has enough air defense systems and the ability to produce weapons for defense,” he said in his daily address. “Weapons are needed here to save lives. Solutions are needed now – not some day, but for the people who endure terrorist attacks every day and night.”In Washington, where US President Joe Biden’s $60 billion request for aid for Ukraine has stalled, the White House said the strike was another sign the war-torn country needed more military assistance, and used it to pressure House Speaker Mike Johnson to bring up a vote on the package.“This strike is yet another reminder of how Russia is continuing to attack Ukraine recklessly every single day and of Ukraine’s urgent needs, in particular, for air defense interceptors,” a National Security Council spokesperson said. “We again call on the House of Representatives to take action to support Ukraine so that we can provide the Ukrainian armed forces with the equipment they desperately need to defend against these outrageous Russian attacks.”European Council President Charles Michel condemned the strike as “another sign of Russia’s cowardly tactics,” which he said were “below even the Kremlin’s playbook.”In May 2022, Michel was visiting Odesa when Russia fired 10 cruise missiles at the region.This story has been updated with additional developments."

        "category": "world",
        "text": "California’s mountain towns and ski resorts are digging out after a blockbuster blizzard buried them and major roads under several feet of snow.The storm slammed California’s mountains for multiple days before wrapping up Monday. The most extreme conditions targeted the highest elevations of the Sierra Nevada, where over 10 feet of snow and hurricane-force wind gusts of 170 mph-plus were reported.Additional snow will fall across high elevations of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest into Wednesday, as a new storm pushes into the region but amounts are expected to be well short of the weekend’s monster storm.Still, even small amounts of additional snow could increase travel woes across the region.A stretch of Interstate 80 in California near the Nevada state line more than 70 miles long was closed for more than two days after highway officials reported stranded drivers Friday night. The road was reopened to passenger vehicles Monday morning and semitrailers Monday afternoon, with chains required on a 40-mile stretch from Baxter to Truckee, according to California’s transportation agency.In the South Lake Tahoe area, where 3 to 5 feet of snow fell, a snowslide trapped vehicles and briefly shut down Highway 50 in California Sunday morning. There were no injuries reported and crews quickly reopened the road, officials said.Incredibly heavy snow and roaring winds presented long-lasting problems for other areas that typically thrive on plenty of snowfall.Numerous ski slopes and chairlifts were closed Sunday because of the extreme conditions, including at Palisades Tahoe, Sierra-at-Tahoe and Mammoth. Many will remain closed on Monday as crews dig out.Alpine Peak at Palisades Tahoe registered a wind gust Saturday of 171 mph, with gusts nearby topping 140 mph on Sunday, forcing it to close.Other nearby high elevations were buried under even more snow. The Sugar Bowl Ski Resort located near Donner Peak recorded 126 inches (10.5 feet) of snow from Friday to Monday. Of that total, 39 inches fell in 24 hours from early Sunday to Monday morning. Soda Springs reported 116 inches, Kingvale had 106 inches and Dodge Ridge saw 89 inches over the same period.The ski resort Sierra-at-Tahoe in Twin Bridges shared images with CNN of snow piling up against the door of the resort’s maintenance shop and a car in the resort’s guest parking buried in snow that fell overnight. At least 5 feet of snow pummeled the resort, but strong winds carried snow into even taller piles creating snow drifts.The daunting forecast wasn’t enough to dissuade some travelers from hitting the road during the worst conditions.The snowy and windy conditions left some vehicles stuck on the main road to Mammoth Mountain ski resort, US 395, on Friday, with some motorists in need of rescue, according to the highway patrol office in Truckee, which reported a “mass amount of vehicles stuck over Donner Summit.” The road was forced to close.The snowfall was so intense with such punishing winds that even crews dispatched to help those trapped found themselves in a similar predicament.“At one point, emergency personnel and tow trucks had a difficult time getting to motorists due to blizzard conditions,” the highway patrol said.The California Highway Patrol posted a photo Saturday afternoon of one of its cars stuck in snow.The severe winter storm conditions in Northern California even damaged and knocked out several pieces of equipment crews were using to clear roadways of snow, California Department of Transportation officials said in a post on X.As communities dig out from the blockbuster storm, one positive development is the state’s snowpack, a critical source of water for California in the warmer months.Statewide snow water equivalent — a measure of how much water is contained within snow — has risen above average for the first time this winter, overcoming a significant deficit from earlier in the season, according to data from the California Department of Water Resources.California’s snow water equivalent is at 104% of its average for March 4 and 94% of its April 1 average, when snowpack is typically at its peak. On February 28, before the storm arrived, the snow water equivalent was 81% of average for the date. In early January, the measure was only at 28%."

        "title": "Pritzker Prize 2024: Japanese housing pioneer Riken Yamamoto wins ‘Nobel of architecture’",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "In the Pritzker Prize’s 45-year history, no country has produced more winners than Japan. And on Tuesday, 78-year-old Riken Yamamoto was named the ninth and latest Japanese laureate of an award often dubbed the “Nobel of architecture.”Best-known for innovative housing projects and educational institutions, Yamamoto is something of a surprise choice. But in a press statement announcing the decision, jury chair and former winner Alejandro Aravena described him as “a reassuring architect who brings dignity to everyday life.” He added: “Normality becomes extraordinary. Calmness leads to splendor.”Across a five-decade career, Yamamoto has dedicated himself to fostering community in Japan’s rapidly expanding cities. From housing projects that coax residents into spontaneous interactions to a glass-walled fire station that invites passersby to peer inside, his architecture appears intent on “blurring boundaries between its public and private dimensions,” a jury citation added.As such, Yamamoto has more in common with other recent winners of the Pritzker Prize — an award that increasingly favors socially-minded architects over the creators of iconic landmarks — than with the Japanese laureates of eras past.It is a point of difference tracing back to the early 1970s: While many of his avant-garde compatriots (most notably 1987 Pritzker laureate Kenzo Tange) advocated conceptual floating cities and grand “megastructures,” Yamamoto was driving across the continents with his mentor to see how people lived in villages around the world. Speaking to CNN ahead of Tuesday’s announcement, he described these formative journeys as “my starting point as an architect.”What Yamamoto found, whether in north Africa or central America, was that human societies were traditionally built around a fluid threshold between private and shared spaces — between villages and the households within them. In modern metropolises, however, this divide has become entrenched to the detriment of their inhabitants, he said.“In the city, we have very few communities — sometimes no community,” Yamamoto said on a video call from Yokohama, near Tokyo, where he founded his architecture firm more than 50 years ago.Social isolation is a concern for both architecture and urban planning. Yamamoto said that cities’ preference for zoning, which governs how land is used, often keeps daily life and commercial activity apart; soaring residential towers (or “tower mansions” as he called them, using a direct but fitting translation of the Japanese term for high-rise condos) meanwhile reinforce what he called the “one family, one house” system.“You can sometimes have 5,000 people living completely independently from the city, and the people inside (tower blocks) are independent of each other… most Japanese people believe this is the ideal living system. I don’t agree with that.”Yamamoto’s solution has been housing that encourages neighbors and the public to come together — a form of architectural intervention that “suggests rather than imposes,” as the Pritzker Prize jury put it.After designing a succession of private homes in his early career, Yamamoto completed his first social housing project, in the coastal city of Kumamoto, in 1991. Hoping to inspire a sense of openness, he arranged its 110 homes into 16 clusters around a tree-lined central courtyard. The central public space has no gates and can only be reached by passing through the housing blocks, a scheme designed to increase the likelihood of chance encounters.Elsewhere, the Shinonome Canal Court project in Tokyo saw Yamamoto connect six huge residential blocks with a second-floor deck comprising terraces and shared green spaces. Pangyo Housing in Seongnam, South Korea (which is among a handful of projects the architect completed outside Japan) also linked homes via communal decks, though the development boasted an altogether more radical design feature: glass walls on the ground level of each residence invited neighbors to look inside one another’s houses.Yamamoto acknowledged this could be seen as an afront to privacy. And, at first, residents felt like they were living in a “fishbowl,” the architect recalled. But over time, they warmed to the idea.“It became very popular, and people liked it … sometimes they use (the ground-floor space) as a gallery. Sometimes it’s the guest room. Sometimes it’s a place to drink and sometimes people gather there,” he said, adding that residents subsequently invited him to a community party at the complex. “I was really, really happy at that moment, because they agreed with my design.”The idea of transparency has informed much of Yamamoto’s oeuvre — and not only housing. The clear glass facade, walls and floors of the fire station he designed in Hiroshima offer pedestrians a rare glimpse inside an institution that, while publicly funded, often hides its inner workings. At the Saitama Prefectural University and Future University (in Koshigaya and Hakodate, respectively), soaring windows provide unobstructed views between classrooms and even departments in the hope of stimulating academic collaboration.If Yamamoto’s civic gestures sound like simple solutions to urban ills, maybe that’s because — by his own reckoning — they are: “It’s very easy to make a community space and public space,” he said, framing his ethos as a return to the way public space operated in medieval Europe or Edo-period Japan.And yet, politics and profit have sometimes stood in the way. Yamamoto expressed dismay that more than 30 years after completing his aforementioned housing project in Kumamoto, his vision of shops and cafes occupying its lower reaches has not yet come to fruition due to local zoning regulations. Perhaps a greater challenge, he added, comes from property developers accustomed to promoting the benefits of standalone private homes.“Of course, political support is very important. But I think developers (should) change their minds a little bit. They believe that ‘one house, one family’ is the best way. I propose to the developer: change the system.”First awarded to American architect Philip Johnson in 1979, the Pritzker Prize recognizes what it describes as architects’ “consistent and significant contributions to humanity and the built environment.”Yamamoto, who has also completed buildings in China and Switzerland, is the latest in a string of laureates recognized for their commitment to the public and civic realms.Last year’s award went to British architect David Chipperfield, who is best-known for cultural institutions like Des Moines Public Library in Iowa his reimagined Neues Museum in Berlin. In 2022, Francis Kéré became the first ever African laureate in recognition of a career designing schools, health centers and community facilities.The Japanese architect will be awarded with $100,000 and a bronze medallion."

The couple had three other children on board and the mother is pregnant, according to a press release from France’s prefecture for the country’s Nord department.Police and the fire brigade rushed to the scene after being alerted by a member of the public who was walking on the shore of the canal. The girl’s family were taken to Dunkirk hospital, the prefecture added.Also on board were another couple, two men and six young children. The prefecture said they were also taken to hospital, but their lives are not in danger.The small boat had likely been stolen and was not designed to carry so many people, the prefecture said.The incident took place in the early hours of Sunday morning, around 30km from the English channel.According to the French prefecture, the incident comes amid an increased surveillance on the channel leading to migrants increasingly trying to launch inland.A press officer told CNN that the fatal capsizing took place between two locks, an area which is “very, very dangerous.”An investigation is underway."

        "category": "world",
        "text": "A chance discovery made in southern France has revealed a rare specimen — an almost complete dinosaur skeleton found connected from its hind skull to its tail.The massive fossil came to light in May 2022, after now 25-year-old amateur paleontologist Damien Boschetto and his dog stumbled across something unusual while walking in a forest in Montouliers, France. Boschetto had noticed a cliff edge that had recently collapsed and decided to take a closer look, when he spotted an exposed bone sticking out of the ground, local media outlet France Bleu first reported on February 13.The Archaeological and Paleontological Cultural Association at the Cruzy Museum, in collaboration with the French National Center for Scientific Research, identified the nearly 10-meter-long (32.8-foot-long) fossil as a Titanosaur skeleton upon excavation. Boschetto, who has been a member of the association for eight years, told CNN that while unearthing dinosaur remains is “always exciting and interesting for scientific research and the understanding of the ecosystems of that time,” finding the bones in their almost original anatomical position is what makes this find extraordinary.“From a museography point of view, it will make it possible to present to the general public animals almost complete in anatomical positions, which is something great,” Boschetto added via email.A group of history and archaeology enthusiasts created the Archaeological and Paleontological Cultural Association in 1975 to safeguard the heritage around the village of Cruzy, with several members becoming enlightened amateurs in paleontology due to the areas’ wealth of dinosaur fossils, said Jean-Marc Veyssières, a member of the group and one of the fossil preparers for this discovery. Today, the association is made up of inhabitants of the region, including a few scientists as well as students.“The most exciting thing was to realize that we had at least one anatomically connected animal and that it was a titanosaur, a long-necked dinosaur,” said Veyssières in an email. “(Boschetto) is an enlightened enthusiast and curious about nature, he spends a lot of time surveying the region in search of new areas. … He became an expert on the Late Cretaceous fauna of our region.”The association has been excavating the site, which Boschetto referred to as a bone bed, a term used by paleontologists to describe a dense area of animal bones and other fossilized remains, for the past two years. And the newly announced find was not Boschetto’s first.The recently revealed 70% complete Titanosaur skeleton was retrieved during the excavation along with several fossils of various dinosaurs and other vertebrates, including some in anatomical connection and near complete. Other remains identified included those of a Rhabdodon — a herbivore, or plant-eater, like the Titanosaur — and fragments from skeletons of carnivores such as Theropods and crocodiles, according to Boschetto.The Titanosaur skeleton currently resides in the Cruzy Museum’s laboratory, where it will be further studied, Veyssières said.Researchers estimated the age of the newly discovered fossil to be around 70 to 72 million years old, but Titanosaurs roamed around on four legs from the Late Jurassic Epoch to the end of the Cretaceous Period, approximately 163.5 million to 66 million years ago. Titanosaurs belong to a larger group of dinosaurs known as sauropods, a family of long-necked herbivores that were some of the largest dinosaurs of their time, according to Britannica.Remains of Titanosaur fossils are widely unearthed in Europe, but few are discovered in anatomical connection, Boschetto said. Finding a skeleton in this connected state suggests that the body was buried before it had entirely decomposed, leaving “some tissues connecting the bones to one another,” said Matthew Carrano, research geologist and curator of Dinosauria at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History.The completeness of the specimen will “make it easier to determine whether it’s a new species or a new specimen of a species that’s already known,” Carrano said in an email. “It will take time to learn all the details about this new specimen, but I’m sure it will provide important new information about this group of dinosaurs.”The region in which Boschetto discovered the specimen is known to be rich in fossils of dinosaurs and other species living at the same time and is “building one of the largest collections of dinosaurs from the Upper Cretaceous in France,” he said. The association did not publicize the discovery until excavation was complete to protect the archaeological site, he added.The association plans to continue research on the fossils and to further search the area, and the group’s members hope to obtain the funds to “create a large-scale museum that can accommodate and present these collections,” Boschetto said."

        "text": "Suspected Islamist insurgents kidnapped 50 people, mostly women, in northeastern Nigeria this week, local officials and a resident said on Wednesday, the latest mass abduction by fighters who have waged an insurgency for more than a decade.Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters have mainly operated in Borno state in the northeast, targeting security forces and civilians, in the process killing and displacing tens of thousands of people.The latest incident took place on Monday in the remote Gamboru area, which shares a border with Chad and Cameroon, said an official of the Civilian Joint Task Force, which helps the army to fight the jihadists.The official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the group of at least 50 people from a camp for internally displaced persons, went to collect firewood on the shores of Lake Chad, where ISWAP is known to operate.They were ambushed by gunmen and made to walk across bushy paths into neighboring Chad, the official said, adding that three of the kidnapped women managed to escape.The Nigerian Army did not respond to a request for comment.Falmata Bukar, one of the three women who escaped, told Reuters by phone that the gunmen had “surrounded us and we were asked to follow them to the bush.”She later escaped with two others on Tuesday, she said.Barkindo Saidu, head of Borno’s emergency agency, said he was traveling to the area to assess the situation but was not yet ready to declare the people missing.The agency is in charge of camps housing thousands of Nigerians displaced by the insurgency."

        "category": "world",
        "text": "Archaeologists have discovered the earliest dated cave paintings in South America in Argentine Patagonia, dating back 8,200 years.The 895 paintings were found by Argentine and Chilean archaeologists in the Huenul 1 cave, a 630 square meter (6,781 square foot) rock shelter located in the province of Neuquen, some 1,100 kilometers (684 miles) southwest of the capital Buenos Aires.“We were able to date four black peniform patterns that were drawn in charcoal. These proved to be the earliest direct dating of cave paintings in South America,” said Dr. Guadalupe Romero Villanueva, author of the research published in the Science Advances journal.The Argentinean archaeologist said the discovery indicates that the production of cave art began in the Huenul cave about 8,000 years ago and that the practice of painting the particular pattern seen in the cave was sustained for a period of at least 3,000 years.The discovery provides evidence of the artistic ability and cultural transmission of the hunter-gatherer societies which inhabited the region during the middle Holocene, a period roughly from 7,000 to 5,000 years ago, and reveals the socioecological resilience to climate, as well as serving as a means of communication between scattered populations.“We believe these images in particular were part of a resilient response of the mobile hunter-gatherer groups that occupied this cave and the desert environments of northern Patagonia to the climatic challenge of a period of extreme dryness that occurred during the middle Holocene,” said Romero Villanueva, a researcher at the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research of Argentina.Villanueva said there are other places in South America that could have older cave paintings, but which only have relative dating, like Argentina’s Cueva de las Manos, with cave paintings dating back 9,500 years."

        "category": "world",
        "text": "The US has called for “urgent” movement toward a political transition in Haiti, as gangs run amok in the nation’s capital and opposition groups demand Prime Minister Ariel Henry’s resignation.Henry landed in the US territory of Puerto Rico on Tuesday after days of speculation about his whereabouts. He had been in Kenya last week to sign an agreement securing a Kenyan-led multinational mission to restore security in the Caribbean nation.According to the Miami Herald, Henry had planned to return to Haiti via the US and the Dominican Republic, but was diverted to Puerto Rico after the Dominican government changed its mind. US officials called Henry mid-flight in an effort to persuade him to step aside in favor of a transitional administration, the report also said.The Dominican Republic rejected informal inquiries from both the US and Haiti’s government this week about a possible “indefinite stopover” for Henry’s plane, the Dominican Republic’s presidential spokesman said Wednesday. “On both occasions the Dominican government communicated the impossibility of said stopover without receiving a defined flight plan,” Homero Figueroa said Wednesday.Asked on Wednesday if the US had asked Henry to resign, US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: “What we’ve asked (Henry) to do is move forward on a political process that will lead to establishment of a presidential transitional council that will lead to elections.”US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US “is not calling on (Henry) or pushing for him to resign” but added that “we are urging him to expedite the transition to an empowered and inclusive governance structure” to prepare for the multinational security mission and eventually for elections.Since Henry’s trip to Kenya, the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince has been gripped by a wave of highly coordinated gang attacks on law enforcement and state institutions. Armed groups have burned down police stations and released thousands of inmates from two prisons, in what one gang leader, Jimmy Cherizier, described as an attempt to overthrow Henry’s government.Cherizier has taken credit for the attacks and warned of even more dire consequences if the international community “continues to support Henry.”“If Ariel Henry doesn’t step down, if the international community continues to support Ariel Henry, they will lead us directly into a civil war that will end in genocide,” Cherizier told Reuters in Port-au-Prince on Tuesday.“The international community, especially the United States, Canada, France, and the Core Group will be responsible for all the people who die in Haiti.”Henry’s predecessor, former Prime Minister Claude Joseph, told CNN Wednesday that political opposition groups are discussing a possible transition of power in Port-au-Prince. That process would likely be structured with the initial appointment of a three-member transitional council, which would select an interim president to lead the country, he said.Joseph said Henry’s resignation has been “overdue” since February 7 of this year, referring to the prime minister’s promise to hold elections in 2023. They were never held, with Henry’s administration citing the country’s insecurity as a major obstacle.Amid the latest bout of political uncertainty, the US is making preparations for the potential for mass migration from Haiti, over concerns that many people could flee as the situation worsens, the Department of Homeland Security official said.The official also said that the US Secret Service assisted in providing Henry with security protection while he was in Puerto Rico, pointing out that it is standard procedure for a foreign leader in the United States.The UN Security Council is due to hold a meeting on Haiti later on Wednesday. Ahead of the meeting, the UN’s High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk urged the international community to “act swiftly and decisively to prevent Haiti’s further descent into chaos.”“This situation is beyond untenable for the people of Haiti,” he said. “We are simply running out of time.”International actors have watched the deteriorating conditions in Haiti with concern. Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for the United Nations Secretary-General, said Wednesday that the worsening situation is increasing the need for the deployment of the support mission.“We need the international community to help the Haitian authorities restore law and order and calm the situation down,” he said.In October, the UN Security Council authorized the multinational security support mission, which Kenya volunteered to lead. However, it remains unclear how exactly the Kenyan-led mission will operate and the timeline for the deployment.This is a developing story and will be updated."

        "category": "world",
        "text": "A potent storm will sweep across a large portion of the United States into the weekend, ramping up the risk for damaging winds, hail, flooding and even a few tornadoes in the South.Atlanta faces a significant flood threat as severe thunderstorms and drenching rainfall focus on the region.Here’s how the threats are expected to unfold through the end of the week.A surge of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will fuel storm tracking over the south-central US Thursday, causing it to become quite potent.Thunderstorms rumbled in parts of the southern Plains Thursday morning, but a round of more intense storms started to fire up in the same areas in the afternoon.Damaging storms will push east through the evening and eventually reach parts of the Mississippi Valley late Thursday night.Drenching rain, damaging wind gusts and hail are the main risks. Very dangerous, large hail could develop and slam parts of central Texas and western Oklahoma.A tornado or two cannot be ruled out, but chances for tornadic activity will increase later this week.Heavy rain within severe thunderstorms could trigger flooding in portions of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. The Dallas area is under a Level 2 of 4 risk for flooding rainfall Thursday, according to the Weather Prediction Center.The storm system driving the damaging weather will also unload soaking rain north of the severe thunderstorms over more of the Plains and Mississippi Valley.The storm will strengthen and expand its reach on Friday as it tracks east. A widespread threat for severe thunderstorms and significant flooding will unfold from the southern Plains to the Southeast.Damaging storms from Thursday night could linger into Friday morning for parts of Texas and Oklahoma, but another round of storms is set to ignite in the region by early Friday afternoon.These storms are likely to rumble to life across parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana and push east through the evening to reach Mississippi and Alabama.Large hail, damaging wind gusts, torrential rain and tornadoes are all possible. A tornado risk covers a large area from Texas and Oklahoma through Alabama and into parts of Georgia and Florida.Dallas, Little Rock, Arkansas, and Jackson, Mississippi, are just a few of the cities under a Level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms on Friday, according to the Storm Prediction Center.Flood threats will also increase. A Level 3 of 4 risk for flooding rainfall is in place for cities from Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama, to Atlanta. Atlanta already dealt with significant flooding Wednesday after 3 inches of rain inundated the area.Torrential rainfall from late Friday through the overnight hours may bring an additional 3 to 4 inches to the Atlanta area and create a fresh round of dangerous flash flooding on already soaked soil incapable of handling much more rain.The wide-reaching storm will expand to much of the East by Saturday and unload another day of severe thunderstorms and flooding.Once again, the greatest risk of severe thunderstorms will center over the southern US. Damaging storms from Friday night are likely to continue Saturday morning in parts of Alabama, Georgia and Florida.Additional storms may rumble to life and push into the Carolinas as rising temperatures provide an extra boost of energy Saturday afternoon.Damaging winds, flooding rainfall and a few tornadoes are expected to be the main risks associated with any of Saturday’s potent thunderstorms.Farther north, the storm will spread drenching rain over the Great Lakes during the day and reach the Northeast by Saturday evening. Rain may change to a wintry mix of rain, ice and snow for high elevations of the interior Northeast late Saturday.After days of active weather, the storm is expected to exit much of the East Sunday and allow drier conditions to take hold. However, some rain and wintry mix may persist in New England ."

New scholars join the program each year.In many regions of Ghana, it can take hours to get to the nearest hospital. As a result, many people lose their lives to treatable illnesses. Osei Boateng experienced this personally when he lost his grandmother and aunt.Feeling an urgent call to help, Boateng decided he would make it his life’s mission to bring health care to remote communities in Ghana.“These people don’t have the luxury of time,” Boateng said.Boateng started his nonprofit, OKB Hope Foundation, and in 2021, he converted a van into a mobile doctor’s office and started bringing health care directly to those in need.A few times a week, the mobile clinic and medical team travel long distances to remote communities in Ghana and provide free routine medical care.In 2008, a stroke and subsequent traumatic brain injury (TBI) nearly killed Stacey Buckner. Today, she says her miraculous road to recovery led her to the outreach work that has become her life’s mission.Through her program, Off-Road Outreach, Buckner has helped more than 1,000 veterans in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Using her own off-road vehicle – a Jeep that has accommodations for water, heating, and cooking – Buckner provides mobile showers, laundry services, and meals to homeless veterans.Since 2015, Buckner travels to hard-to-reach places each week to find and serve veterans in need. Without judgment, Buckner asks what she can do to help them.“There should be no homeless vets, period,” Buckner said. “I am to a lot of them their only family.”In 1996, Mike Goldberg left his job in Los Angeles to follow his passion for underwater diving. Goldberg and his family later settled in Islamorada, in the Florida Keys, and opened a dive shop, Key Dives.As an avid diver, Goldberg developed a strong appreciation for the coral reefs and their essential role in the marine ecosystem. Today, he’s on a mission to help bring the area’s coral reefs back to life through his nonprofit, I.CARE.Goldberg says the organization has transplanted more than 10,000 corals and educated more than 2,000 people. The I.CARE team monitors and maintains all of the transplanted coral, making sure it’s thriving.“There’s so much work to do. We’re just getting started,” Goldberg said.When Tescha Hawley received her breast cancer diagnosis at age 46, the lifesaving treatment she needed several times a month was at a hospital a three-hour drive away.Hawley, a member of the Gros Ventre tribe, has two master’s degrees, yet the challenges she had to navigate to receive the care she needed were daunting. As a single mother, Hawley ultimately took leave without pay to complete her treatment.“As American Indian people, we represent the highest (rates) of everything – diabetes, heart disease, cancer – and we receive the poorest health care,” Hawley said.After her experience, Hawley founded the Day Eagle Hope Project in 2017, and her nonprofit has since expanded to address many other needs of Native Americans in her community.In 2008, first grade teacher Alvin Irby stopped by a Bronx barbershop after school for a haircut. Before long, one of his students came in.“He’s kind of looking bored,” Irby recalled. “I’m looking at this student (thinking), ‘He should be practicing his reading.’ But I didn’t have a book.”That moment stayed with Irby, and five years later he started Barbershop Books. Since 2013, the nonprofit has brought more than 50,000 free children’s books to more than 200 barbershops in predominantly Black neighborhoods across the country.Irby is working to change lower literacy rates by encouraging boys to read for fun, on their own.“Our program is about getting kids to say three words: ‘I’m a reader,’” he said.Kevin Pearce was at the height of his professional snowboarding career and bound for the Winter Olympics. During training, he struck his head on the edge of a halfpipe, resulting in a traumatic brain injury.He had to relearn how to walk and talk. He eventually started yoga, and his family saw how it transformed him and gave him a sense of hope.“I remember … coming out of a class with him and just seeing in his face this new expression, this new person,” his brother Adam Pearce said.Wanting to bring hope and healing to others through yoga and meditation, Adam and Kevin co-founded the LoveYourBrain Foundation. The organization aims to create a safe space and supportive community where people with a TBI can heal together.Estefanía Rebellón understands the fear and uncertainty felt by the more than 70 million migrant and forcibly displaced children around the world. She was a migrant child, too.In 2018, she was so moved after volunteering in migrant camps in Tijuana, Mexico, that she put her acting career on hold.“There were no schools set up to help these kids. They were walking around the camps barefoot,” she said.Rebellón and her partner used their savings to buy tents and supplies and set up a makeshift school at the US-Mexico border. Then they transformed buses into mobile classrooms to reach more families.Now, through her nonprofit, Yes We Can World Foundation, she provides education for children living in limbo in shelters at the border. Since 2019, Rebellón says the group has served more than 3,100 migrant children.Every parent’s worst nightmare is losing their child. Shamayim Harris has lived through that nightmare – twice.Her 2-year-old son was struck and killed in a hit-and-run in 2007 in Highland Park, a suburb of Detroit. Years later, her 23-year-old son was shot and killed while on a neighborhood watch.“I needed to … change grief into glory, pain into power,” said Harris, who is known as Mama Shu.In 2016, she created the Avalon Village, a nonprofit with the mission of creating a safe and nurturing space for the entire Highland Park community. Today, she and her organization own 45 lots of land across three blocks. The biggest project has been fully refurbishing an abandoned house into an after-school hub for children.Dr. Kwane Stewart’s outreach on the streets started more than a decade ago. On a whim, the veterinarian stopped to examine the dog of a homeless man outside a 7-11 where he got his coffee.Stewart treated the dog’s skin condition and the animal was transformed. But for Stewart, the man’s gratitude was a wakeup call: “Thank you for not ignoring me” were the words that Stewart says inspired his next chapter.Stewart’s nonprofit, Project Street Vet, provides medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness.“It doesn’t matter what your situation is … I see a pet in need, and I see a person who cares for them dearly who just needs some help,” Stewart said."

        "title": "Thousands gather for Navalny’s funeral in Moscow despite threat of arrest",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Thousands of mourners gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny despite a heavy police presence and the threat of detention.Mourners clapped and chanted Navalny’s name as his coffin arrived at the church where his funeral took place. Others shouted “Putin is a killer” or “no to war.”Navalny, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most formidable opponent, died aged 47 in an Arctic prison on February 16, sparking condemnation from world leaders and accusations from his aides that he had been murdered. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in his death.Navalny’s team encountered difficulty in retrieving his body from Russian authorities and hiring a venue for his funeral, which was held Friday afternoon at the Church of the Icon of the Mother of God in Moscow’s Maryino district, where the Kremlin critic lived.He was later buried at Borisov Cemetery, where Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” played as his coffin was lowered into the ground. A system was in place to allow mourners to pay their respects to Navalny at the burial site.Crowd control barriers were erected along the route to the cemetery, flanked by dozens of police vans. Police officers were deployed on rooftops overlooking the growing line of mourners, video from the scene showed.Ahead of the funeral, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned Russians against unauthorized memorials for Navalny, saying those attending would be “in violation of the law.”Maria Pevchikh, a close aide to Navalny, said the chants for Navalny will continue. “People are chanting ‘Navalny! Navalny!’ in loud voices. This chanting we will hear in months’ time, in a year’s time,” she said.Around 20 minutes before Navalny’s funeral began, the live signal of the CNN team on the ground appeared to be blocked. The live feed organized by Navalny’s team also dropped. CNN’s signal went back up shortly after the service finished.A Russian woman named Polina, one of thousands of mourners outside the church, told CNN’s Matthew Chance that Navalny’s death was “horribly sad,” but that it had united many Russians.“There are obviously some people who are, I guess, against the whole thing that is happening right now. I can’t say it, obviously. But there are some people who have good hearts.”Dissent has been effectively outlawed in Russia since Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. Russian authorities outlawed Navalny’s movement as extremist and expressing support for him can be perilous.Navalny’s team shared an image from inside the church during the service, showing the Kremlin critic’s body showered with roses while his mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya – who spent more than a week in Siberia attempting to retrieve her son’s body – held a candle and watched on.Those waiting in line ahead of the service told CNN they had gathered to pay their respects to their “hero.” Marina said she had traveled from St. Petersburg because she “loved” Navalny.“He was a true hero … I want to say to him ‘farewell,’” she said, adding that she was not surprised that the Kremlin had denied any involvement in Navalny’s death. “They demonstrate to the whole world we do what we want to do,” she said. “We can repress you.”Another woman, Tatiana, 82, said she had attended several of Navalny’s meetings and was a longstanding supporter.“I always supported their [Navalny’s] policy, their ideas. I share these ideas,” Tatiana said.Neither woman said they were deterred by the potential risk of coming to the funeral.But Yulia Navalnaya, Navalny’s widow, had said ahead of the funeral that she is concerned police will crack down on mourners.“I’m not sure yet whether it will be peaceful or whether police will arrest those who have come to say goodbye to my husband,” she told the European Parliament on Wednesday.At least 45 people were arrested across Russia on Friday for paying their respects to Navalny, monitoring group OVD Info reported. It said six people were detained in Moscow, while 18 were detained in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk – the largest number of any city. Another 10 were detained in Yekaterinburg for laying flowers. CNN could not independently verify the report.Navalnaya, now living in exile along with their children most of Navalny’s team, thanked her husband for “26 years of absolute happiness.”“I don’t know how to live without you, but I will try to make you up there happy for me and proud of me. I don’t know if I can handle this or not, but I will try,” she wrote online, along with a video of their moments together.Navalny’s death was met with grief and anger across the world as well as inside Russia, where the smallest acts of political dissent carry huge risks. More than 400 people were detained at makeshift memorials for Navalny across 32 Russian cities, according to OVD-Info.Navalny returned to Russia in 2021, after spending months recovering in Germany from Novichok poisoning a Bellingcat-CNN investigation found was carried about by Russian intelligence.He was immediately arrested upon his arrival and spent the rest of his life behind bars on charges he dismissed as politically motivated.This is a developing story and will be updated."

        "text": "The fountains at Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas were paused after a rare bird stopped by for a visit.A Yellow-billed Loon was seen taking a dip in Lake Bellagio, the resort shared on X Tuesday evening.“The Fountains of Bellagio are paused as we work with state wildlife officials to rescue a Yellow-billed Loon, one of the 10 rarest birds in the U.S., that has found comfort on Las Vegas’ own Lake Bellagio,” the resort said.The Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW) became involved in relocating the bird.“Rest assured, our experts have determined that the Bellagio fountains pose no harm to the bird, and we have instructed the hotel that the fountains can continue to operate without risk to any wildlife,” NDOW shared on Facebook.The juvenile bird was safely captured Wednesday morning and relocated to a more suitable, remote location with space, food and quiet surroundings, according to a NDOW Facebook post.The bird appeared to be in good health, according to a biologist involved in the bird’s capture.Yellow-billed Loons are generally associated with coastal regions, the NDOW said.They are considered a species of conservation concern because of their small global population and habitat limitations, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.The Fountains of Bellagio resumed their regular schedule Wednesday afternoon."

        "title": "No space left for bodies, says gravedigger who’s overseen half of Gaza’s burials",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Saadi Baraka wakes at dawn and works until dusk, digging on his knees in the dirt as he tries to bury Gaza’s dead with dignity in a cemetery he says has run out of room.The graveyard at Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, dotted with the green and gray of shrubs and tombs, has been expanded several times in recent months to accommodate the interminable flow of bodies.Baraka says he has buried 16,880 people since Israel launched its assault on Gaza in response to Hamas’ October 7 terror attack – more than half of the 30,631 reported dead by the enclave’s ministry of health. Israel estimates about 10,000 of those killed are Hamas fighters. CNN cannot independently verify the casualty tolls in Gaza or the Israeli estimates of Hamas fighters killed.“I come to the cemetery at 6 a.m. and stay until 6 p.m. to prepare mass graves for 30, 40 people,” Baraka told CNN Monday. “I have made 167 mass graves. I only hope they send us some tiles and cement so we can bury the people with dignity.”Baraka, 64, was a gravedigger long before October 7. But he says the horrors he has seen since then – dismembered children, whole families buried together, graves filled “with tens of people in each” – have been hard to comprehend.“I try to go to sleep, and I swear I can’t even if I take 2 kilos of sleeping pills,” he said.Baraka estimates around 85% of those he has buried have been women and children. “They killed all the women. They were all killed because they are the ones that stayed at home,” he said.Of the thousands of bodies that have poured into his cemetery, he claimed he has buried no more than three Hamas fighters. He said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “is lying when he says he is killing Hamas.”CNN footage shows workers building new graves with concrete blocks above ground instead of digging fresh ones in the crowded earth. Baraka pours dirt through a sieve, separating the rocks from the silt, then adds water and churns the cement with a shovel, before smoothing it with a spade over the top of a grave, covered with a flap of corrugated iron.Most tombstones are a single concrete block – the same used to build the walls of the grave. Epitaphs are scratched into the concrete with a nail, or simply etched into the wet cement with the tip of a spade.As Baraka and his men work, they are surrounded by the buzz of Israeli drones and the stench of death.“Of course it smells, those are mass graves,” he says. He remembers many of the dead by name. “This is the Laghi family, this is the Abu Hasanein family, those are Abu Hattab,” he says, pointing.While many of the dead have been killed by Israeli airstrikes, which have pummeled Gaza for nearly five months, many are now dying of hunger, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).A WHO team said Monday it found “severe levels of malnutrition, children dying of starvation, serious shortages of fuel, food and medical supplies, hospital buildings destroyed,” during a recent visit to the north of Gaza.The warning came just days after scores of Palestinians were killed trying to access food in Gaza City on Thursday. At least 118 were killed and 760 injured in an incident where Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops used live fire as hungry and desperate Palestinian civilians gathered around food aid trucks, according to the Palestinian ministry of health.After the incident, the US for the first time air-dropped humanitarian aid into Gaza. More than 38,000 meals were dropped Saturday along the Gaza coastline in a combined operation by the US Air Force and the Royal Jordanian Air Force. A further 36,800 were dropped Tuesday, according to CENTCOM.But Baraka dismissed the operations as a political stunt. “We don’t want them to drop fast food from airplanes. They are showing off.”While CNN filmed, a woman entered the cemetery with several men carrying the bagged body of her lifeless daughter. She begs Baraka to see her daughter before he buries her. Baraka agrees, then asks the men to let the woman look upon her daughter for the last time while he prepares her grave. Later, dozens stand and pray while her body is lowered into the ground.Baraka said he worked in Israel for 28 years and wants to live to see an end to generations of violence.“I only want peace and I see no other solution. We should live as one and that’s it. It’s enough with all those wars,” he said.He said he supports “two states for two people living together with love,” but warned that Israel’s attempt to “destroy” Hamas will not bring this about.“You are wasting your time, Netanyahu,” Baraka says in Arabic, before switching to Hebrew. “If you want to finish Hamas – I tell you in Hebrew so you can hear me – you are wasting your time.”"

        "category": "world",
        "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron and former US President Bill Clinton were among those paying tribute to Nigerian banking boss Herbert Wigwe as his funeral got underway.Wigwe was a towering figure in African banking and philanthropy and his death has spurred an outpouring of grief.A seven-day funeral ceremony celebrating his life is currently being held in Nigeria’s commercial hub Lagos.Wigwe died last month in a helicopter crash along with his wife and son in the Mojave Desert near the California-Nevada border. A former group chairman of the Nigeria Stock Exchange, Abimbola Ogunbanjo, was also killed in the crash.“France has lost a great friend in Herbert Wigwe,” said Macron, represented Wednesday by French foreign trade minister Franck Riester at the ‘Night of Tributes’ memorial for the Wigwes held in Lagos’ Victoria Island.“Not only was he dedicated to the development of cross-cultural initiatives between our two countries, but he has also without respite worked to increase our economic partnership,” he added.Former US President Bill Clinton also paid tribute to Wigwe, saying “Words cannot ease the pain of such a tragic loss.”Clinton added that he “deeply admired Herbert’s commitment to widening the circle of opportunity for young people in Nigeria and supporting humanitarian work around the world.”Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu earlier called the death of the Wigwes “an overwhelming tragedy that is shocking beyond comprehension,” while Vice President Kashim Shettima mourned their deaths in a eulogy delivered at the memorial Wednesday.“Herbert left us in winter before the season of bloom,” the Nigerian vice president said.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa described Wigwe as a “continental partner and banking sector pioneer” whose death was a “terrible loss.”Africa’s richest man Aliko Dangote gave a tearful tribute to Wigwe, describing him as a “loyal friend” and “mentee.”“I feel very helpless because I could not prevent the tragedy that befell my friend, brother, and mentee - a very loyal friend for that matter,” said Dangote who added he was immortalizing Wigwe by renaming one of the major roads leading to his refinery after him.Wigwe’s aide, Olusola Faleye, described his final moments during the ‘Night of Tributes’ event held in Lagos on Wednesday. Faleye said he was supposed to fly with his boss on the ill-fated journey to Las Vegas but opted at the last minute to go by road with the family’s luggage.“Since 2019, I cannot count one or two places or flights that he (Wigwe) has been in that I’m not in it. We were always together,” said Faleye.Born in August 1966 in the city of Ibadan, Wigwe’s father Shyngle was a civil servant, and his mother Stella a nurse. Wigwe has spoken of how they instilled in him the values of hard work, integrity, and service to others.Wigwe graduated with a degree in accounting from the prestigious University of Nigeria Nsukka in 1987 and embarked on a career in finance. He later pursued a master’s degree in Banking and Finance at North Wales University (now Bangor University) in the United Kingdom.In 1991 Wigwe returned to Nigeria and began his professional journey as a graduate assistant at Coopers and Lybrand Associates Limited, swiftly rising through the ranks.He later joined the Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB), where he became the youngest executive director at the age of 32.It was during his tenure at GTB that Herbert forged a lifelong friendship and partnership with Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, another rising star in the Nigerian banking scene.Together, they set their sights on a venture that would change the landscape of Nigerian banking forever.In 2002, Wigwe and Aig-Imoukhuede made history by acquiring Access Bank, a relatively unknown institution at the time.Under his leadership, Access Bank transformed from a modest entity into one of Africa’s biggest banks, with branches in Paris and South Africa. Wigwe was planning an Asian expansion at the time of his death."

        "text": "A 2-month-old was among the dead in a mass killing in Canada that claimed the lives of 4 children, their mother and a family friend, Ottawa police said Thursday.The father of the family survived the attack and emerged from the home injured and asking for help, police said. He remains in the hospital in serious but stable condition.Police responded to a man calling for help at about 10:52 p.m. and found the victims upon arrival.The victims have been identified as Darshani Banbaranayake Gama Walwwe Darshani Dilanthika Ekanyake, 35, and her children; Inuka, 7; Ashwini, 4; Rinyana, 2; and 2-month-old Kelly. All are Sri Lankan nationals and newcomers to Canada, authorities said.A family friend, Amarakoonmubiayansela Ge Gamini Amarakoon, 40, who was living at the family’s home at the time, was also killed in the attack.Ottawa police chief Eric Stubbs called the tragedy an “unimaginable loss” during a Thursday news conference.“This will undoubtedly weigh on the hearts of everyone for a long time,” Stubbs said.Febrio De-Zoysa, 19, faces 6 counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder and was scheduled to appear in court later Thursday. Police say he was an acquaintance living at the family’s home at the time of the killings.“The accused is a Sri Lankan national who is believed to have been in Canada as a student,” Stubbs said, adding De-Zoysa is the only suspect.Police say they believe a “sharp-edged” weapon was used to commit the murders.“We know there are a lot of questions about why this tragedy occurred. This is the focus of our Homicide Unit as they diligently investigate this tragic crime,” Stubbs said.“This was a senseless act of violence perpetrated on purely innocent people,” Stubbs added. “I know our whole community is shocked and mourning this event.”"

        "title": "10 years on, is the world any closer to finding MH370?",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "For the past 10 years it has remained one of the modern era’s greatest mysteries.A commercial airliner with a strong safety record carrying 239 people vanishing from the map, spawning a wide variety of competing theories, books and documentaries and leaving the families of those left behind asking themselves every March 8 – what happened to those aboard Malaysia Airlines flight 370?In an era when black boxes have been successfully hauled up from the very depths of the ocean and whole chunks of a downed airliner painstakingly pieced back together to determine what caused a catastrophe, the fate of MH370 remains infuriatingly elusive.It is a plane crash without a plane. A disaster without conclusive proof of what happened to its victims. A story that anyone who embarks on a commercial flight can instantly relate to but one that, for now at least, doesn’t have a closing chapter.Yet many experts believe there is still a strong chance MH370’s wreckage could be located, if someone looks hard enough and – crucially – coughs up the staggering amount of money that might be required to achieve that goal.For Jiang Hui, who lost his mother in the disaster, this time of year is especially tough – and not just because of the March 8 anniversary.Qingming, the annual festival when Chinese people visit and clean their ancestors’ graves, falls in early April.“But we never found MH370. I never found my mother,” Jiang told CNN. “I can’t commemorate my mother just like everyone else.”His mother, Jiang Cuiyun, is still listed as “missing” back home in China, he said.“I will only find my mom if I can find MH370,” he added.Beijing-bound Malaysia Airlines flight 370 dropped off the radar shortly after departing Kuala Lumpur in the small hours of March 8, 2014.The take-off was uneventful. The flight reached its cruising altitude of 35,000 feet and the pilots spoke briefly with Vietnamese air traffic as the plane headed on its standard route.After that the aircraft stopped communicating, then vanished from radar when it made an unexpected turn to the west.Apparent fragments have since washed up on the eastern coast of Africa and islands in the Indian Ocean, where the aircraft and those on board are believed to have met their fate.But to this day, the body of the aircraft and its black box has never been found. It’s believed to have crashed. But we still don’t know why.This week, many loved ones of those missing returned to Malaysia to urge local authorities to relaunch a search ahead of Friday’s anniversary.“There have been ships lost that are found after hundreds of years. So we cannot say that this plane will never be found,” one family member V.P.R Nathan told Reuters during a recent commemorative event. His wife Anne Daisy was on board MH370.“Of course it can be found. It is a matter of time,” he said.Aviation experts tell CNN that improved detection technology will likely bring families closer to the missing plane than they ever have been, if a search were to be relaunched.But that will not be cheap.Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent scouring more than 710,000 square kilometers of the Indian Ocean until 2018, but nothing transpired that moved our understanding on from that already available since the very early days.United States-based sea exploration firm Ocean Infinity is offering the Malaysian government another “no-find, no-fee” deal - like they did in 2018 - but experts noted the authorities would still have to pay up if the aircraft was found.To families’ encouragement, Malaysian authorities have made some positive remarks about the prospect of a new search. On Sunday, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said his country would “do everything possible to solve this mystery once and for all.”He said his ministry is “ready” to discuss a new “credible” search proposal with Ocean Infinity and will do “everything possible” to get Cabinet approval for a new contract with the firm.“As we approach the 10 years remembrance of this heart-wrenching tragedy, it is a painful reminder of the decade-long journey of grief and resilience that loved ones of the victims have endured,” he said.Oliver Plunkett, CEO of Ocean Infinity, said since the 2018 search, the company has been honing its robotics and sea-exploration technology, while working with analysts to narrow down search areas to “one in which success becomes potentially achievable.”“We hope to get back to the search soon,” he said in a recent statement.But neither Ocean Infinity nor the Malaysian government have given more concrete details on their possible plans.With little facts established, the disappearance of MH370 has puzzled the world and set off all kinds of theories over the years, from mechanical failure to accidental or deliberate pilot error and even some sort of hijacking.Where facts end and the mystery begins is around 40 minutes into the flight when the plane’s transponder stopped transmitting.Its blips soon disappeared from civilian and military radar. Subsequent traces eventually led experts to conclude the aircraft had flown drastically off course.Instead of flying northeast across the South China Sea, analysts believed it turned back and glided south inexplicably over the Indian Ocean, one of the world’s most remote locations in terms of flight monitoring due to the lack of imaging satellites, according to aviation experts.“This has all the hallmarks of a spy thriller, an espionage thriller. And it’s captured the world’s imagination,” Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com, said.“Everybody can place themselves on a Boeing 777. Everybody can place themselves flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing,” he said. “It’s so real.”An initial search, carried out by Malaysia, China, and Australia and estimated to have cost 200 million Australian dollars ($132 million), was called off in January 2017 after failing to find any trace. Ocean Infinity was then brought in by the Malaysian government on a no-find, no-fee basis. But its 90-day search in 2018 also failed to bear fruit.Richard Quest, CNN’s Business editor-at-large and former Aviation Correspondent said despite years of search efforts, “the real truth is we are no closer to knowing exactly what caused the plane to go missing.”“The hope is that new search techniques, new equipment, and better understanding of what happened to the plane will make this search successful,” said Quest, author of “The Vanishing of Flight MH370.”Aviation experts are confident about a breakthrough, if a new search is to be conducted.They pointed to a piece of technology called Weak Signal Propagation Reporter, or WSPR (pronounced whisper), released in 2008. The technology has become popular among those looking for MH370 in recent years.Radio amateurs use it to track the strength of radio signals around the world and the data they collect catch anomalies caused by various types of interferences, which include a flight passing through, retired British Aerospace engineer Richard Godfrey explained to CNN.Godfrey said he traced WSPR data back to the time when MH370 disappeared and concluded the aircraft may be lying between 3,000 and 4,000 meters (9,800 to 13,000 feet) below the Indian Ocean, about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) off the coast of Perth, Australia.As thorough as past searches might be, Godfrey said, they have not covered the location he suggested.“I certainly believe MH370 can be found,” he said, adding that his findings are in line with other hints, such as data provided by British satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat, which pointed to more or less the same area.But even if another expedition is granted, he said, preparation work could take months.AirlineRatings’s Thomas has “a strong feeling” Godfrey is right but raises another anxiety. “I’m concerned that they’re just giving the relatives some warm, comfortable statements on the anniversary,” he said, of the Malaysian authorities.Some relatives, like American Sarah Bajc, who lost her partner Phil Wood, have tried to move on. But she still feels like she is living in the shadow of the past from time to time.Since the flight’s disappearance, Bajc has moved from Asia to Panama, where she remarried and opened an eco-resort that allows her and her husband to live off grid in the rainforest.But to this day, she avoids watching dramas and documentaries about plane crashes and has recurring nightmares.“I would have nightmares of diving in this beautiful area with lots of fish. And then all of a sudden, the plane hull would be there, and the bodies would be floating,” she said.On the prospect of a new search, she is sanguine.“Maybe they’re ready to do that, in which case I’m very happy because … the families need closure, the world needs closure, and somebody needs to be held accountable,” she said, of the prospect of another search being launched by Malaysia.Others, like Jiang, are determined to get to the bottom of the truth.He says not a day goes by when he doesn’t think of his mother, who he described as a strong and hardworking woman he idolized as an inspirational figure.“I can find her shadow in me. Whatever I am doing now is what my mother wants me to do,” he said.Jiang is among the 40 families who launched another bid back home last year to seek justice through the Chinese legal system.Those on board came from a multitude of nationalities but China was hit by far the hardest with 153 passengers.The claimants in China are suing Malaysia Airlines, its insurer, Boeing and the manufacturer of the plane’s engine, demanding compensation, a formal apology, and the resumption of psychological assistance to family members, as well as the creation of a fund to continue searches for the plane.It’s unclear, however, how much jurisdiction Chinese courts will have over the list of companies with headquarters overseas.Having spent the past few days meeting Malaysian officials, Jiang is optimistic about a new search. But it also gives him mixed feelings.“On one hand, I really want to find the plane today or tomorrow,” he said. “But I am also afraid of the reality I must face after finding the plane.”"

        "title": "Children starve to death in Gaza, WHO says, as ceasefire deal sticking points remain",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "A growing number of children in Gaza are dying of starvation and dehydration, according to the World Health Organization and Palestinian officials, amid desperate conditions due to Israel’s throttling of aid and destruction of the besieged enclave — reinforcing the urgency of this week’s ceasefire talks.A WHO team found “severe levels of malnutrition, children dying of starvation, serious shortages of fuel, food and medical supplies, hospital buildings destroyed,” during a recent visit to the Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals in northern Gaza, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X Monday.Tedros appealed to Israel to ensure the safe and regular delivery of humanitarian aid and for a halt to the fighting.Negotiators gathered in the Egyptian capital Cairo on Sunday for talks on a Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal and release of hostages from Gaza, but Israel did not send a delegation, an Israeli official told CNN, despite increasing international pressure to end hostilities and allow for a desperately needed surge of humanitarian aid.The official said the reason was that Hamas had not responded to two Israeli demands: a list of Israeli hostages specifying which are alive and which are dead; and confirmation of the ratio of Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli prisons, in exchange for the hostages taken when Hamas militants attacked communities in southern Israel on October 7.The militant group wants a permanent end to fighting before agreeing to release hostages, a Hamas source told CNN as a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Sunday. However, a high-ranking Hamas official did not immediately respond to a CNN question about whether the militant group had responded to Israel’s conditions.It comes as the United States is increasingly vocal about the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, where the United Nations warns hundreds of thousands of people are on the brink of famine and US ally Israel continues to obstruct the bulk of aid deliveries.On Saturday, the US made its first humanitarian airdrop into the strip — 66 bundles containing meals but no water or medical supplies, a US official said. Aid groups have criticized the air drops as an ineffective and degrading way to get aid to Palestinians in Gaza, with the International Crisis Group’s UN director saying they are at best a “temporary Band-Aid measure.”One of the strongest rebukes of Israel by a US official to date came from US Vice President Kamala Harris, who on Sunday forcefully called for more humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying that people in the region are “starving” in the face of “inhumane” conditions and urged Israel to do more.She called for an “immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks,” a proposal currently on the negotiating table, and urged Hamas to free Israeli hostages.“What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating. We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed. Women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care, and children dying from malnutrition and dehydration,” Harris said, citing the deaths of dozens of Palestinians amid Israeli gunfire and panic at Gaza food lines.“The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses,” said Harris.Her comments come at a critical moment in the Israel-Hamas war. On Monday, Benny Gantz, a key member of Israel’s war cabinet and one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s most prominent political rivals, was in Washington, holding meetings with high-level US officials that will include Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.Gantz’s three-day trip to the US capital has rankled some of Netanyahu’s allies. Dudi Amsalem, Minister of Regional Cooperation and a member of Netanyhau’s Likud party, said Gantz’s visit was in “total violation of government regulations” and accused Gantz of attempting to “stop the IDF from winning the war and create an opportunity to lead the process of establishing a Palestinian state that will eliminate the State of Israel!”Israel’s public broadcaster Kan reported that Netayahu was not aware of Gantz’s plans and had instructed the Israeli embassy in Washington not to facilitate the visit. But Gantz said he personally informed Netanyahu of his plans to visit Washington DC over the weekend, according to a statement from his office. CNN has reached out to Netanyahu’s office for comment.Since the war began, Gantz’s National Unity party has steadily climbed in the opinion polls while Likud has lost ground.In northern Gaza, children are starving to death and others fighting for their lives as critical supplies are held up from reaching those in need.A Palestinian Ministry of Health spokesperson said Sunday the number of children who have died of dehydration and malnutrition in northern Gaza has risen to 15.CNN cannot independently confirm the deaths of the children or their causes due to the lack of international media access to wartime Gaza.A further 124 people were killed over the past 24 hours, the Gaza Ministry of Health said Monday, bringing the death toll in the enclave since October 7 to 30,534.Doctors at the Kamal Adwan Hospital also “fear for the lives of six children suffering from malnutrition and diarrhea in intensive care as a result of the cessation of the electric generator and oxygen and the weakness of medical capabilities,” Dr. Ashraf Al-Qidra, the Ministry spokesman in Gaza, said in a statement.The death toll has been rising since last week when incubators and oxygen supplies at Kamal Adwan Hospital ceased to operate at night because of fuel shortages, the ministry said.A WHO team visiting the hospital at the weekend corroborated the dire conditions, saying the lack of food resulted in the deaths of 10 children at the hospital.“Kamal Adwan Hospital is the only paediatrics hospital in the north of Gaza, and is overwhelmed with patients… The lack of electricity poses a serious threat to patient care, especially in critical areas like the intensive care unit and the neonatal unit,” WHO chief Tedros said on X.The United Nations children’s agency has called for urgent action, requesting “multiple reliable entry points” to allow them to bring aid.“Humanitarian aid agencies like UNICEF must be enabled to reverse the humanitarian crisis, prevent a famine, and save children’s lives,” UNICEF’s Adele Khodr said in a statement Sunday.UNICEF said it was also aware of at least 10 children dying due to dehydration and malnutrition in recent days at Kamal Adwan Hospital.“There are likely more children fighting for their lives somewhere in one of Gaza’s few remaining hospitals, and likely even more children in the north unable to obtain care at all,” Khodr added.One recent incident exposed the particularly desperate situation in northern Gaza.More than 100 people were killed last week when Israeli troops opened fire on crowds, triggering panic as hungry Palestinian civilians were gathering around food aid trucks, Palestinian officials and eyewitnesses said.Israel said its troops fired warning shots to disperse the crowd. A UN team that visited victims said many suffered gunshot wounds.In a separate incident on Sunday, at least eight people were killed and several others injured in an Israeli strike on an aid distribution truck in central Gaza, the enclave’s health ministry told CNN. The truck, carrying aid donated by Kuwait, was struck on the Al Rashid coastal road in the city of Deir El Belah.CNN footage shows a medium-sized truck destroyed, with seats covered in blood. Some people can be seen gathered around the wrecked vehicle, looking through the sand for aid that is still intact and can be used. The IDF has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.UNICEF’s Khodr described the situation in Gaza as “man-made, predictable, and entirely preventable,” and warned the death toll among children could rapidly increase unless immediate action is taken.“The widespread lack of nutritious food, safe water and medical services, a direct consequence of the impediments to access and multiple dangers facing UN humanitarian operations, is impacting children and mothers, hindering their ability to breastfeed their babies, especially in the northern Gaza Strip,” she said.“People are hungry, exhausted and traumatized. Many are clinging to life.”This story has been updated with additional information."

        "title": "Google opens New York headquarters in repurposed 1930s railway terminal",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Google is set to open its New York headquarters in a repurposed 1930s railway terminus near Hudson Square on Monday — and the tech giant says the project was designed with nature in mind.The 12-story St. John’s Terminal building, located at the nexus of Hudson River Park, the West Village, SoHo and Tribeca, is being billed as a “workplace designed for teams,” but it’s also providing a new home for local flora and fauna.With 1.5 acres of street-level vegetation, rail bed gardens and terraces that are 95% made up of plants native to New York State, the habitat created by the project has attracted more than 40 bird species, “including birds fueling up for a trans-Atlantic migratory flight,” wrote Google’s president for Americas and Global Business, Sean Downey, in an open letter on Wednesday.“It’s actually re-knitting the ecosystem, from the insects to the birds,” said Rick Cook, a founding partner at CookFox Architects, one of the design firms behind the project, in an introductory video published by Google.Once at the end of the railway now forming New York’s High Line, St. John’s Terminal served as a freight facility and office space. The renovation retained the original rail beds, turning them into planters that hang above the building’s main entrance, and incorporated wood reclaimed from the Coney Island boardwalk after Hurricane Sandy. Google said that the decision to repurpose an old building, rather than constructing its new headquarters from scratch, saved 78,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions (equivalent to taking around 17,000 cars off the road for a year). The tech giant also claimed it had prevented 77% of its construction waste from ending up in landfills.The complex is one of several Google offices built in renovated structures, including a converted flour mill in Dublin, a former aircraft hangar in LA’s Playa Vista neighborhood and Pier 57, once a New York City shipping terminal. The tech firm also owns the nearby Chelsea Market, purchased for $2.4 billion in 2018 after it had been converted into a retail and office development.Google began leasing the St. John’s Terminal site in 2019, and bought it outright in 2022 for $2.1 billion. The building serves as a headquarters for Google’s Global Business Organization, which includes the firm’s sales and partnership teams.The renovation project was commissioned in 2018, before the Covid-19 pandemic, but its final design was later adapted to offer more flexible work arrangements. Google, like many large corporations in America, is trying to entice workers back to the office, and the new campus — whose interiors were designed by international architecture studio Gensler — is being heralded by the tech giant as a place to connect and innovate.“If you’re going to make that commute in, it should be because you can work with people that have passion, that have ideas, that you can sit next to and come up with something that you couldn’t do just on your own, and that’s really the vision of this space,” said Downey in a video introducing the new campus.The building can accommodate around 3,000 workers and is organized into 60 “neighborhoods” for teams of around 20 to 50 people. There are no assigned desks but instead workers can use flexible seating areas or shared spaces including lounges, cafes, terraces and micro-kitchens.“Creativity wants to move around, so we’ve created as much common spaces as we have neighborhood space, if not more, for people to meet, to work, to collaborate,” said Jennifer Kelly, a vice president of workplace experience, in the same video. “Some feel like a library, some feel like a coffee shop, so people have options to use spaces that they feel most comfortable in.”There are currently more than 14,000 Google employees in New York, up from 7,000 when the company announced the St. John’s Terminal project in 2018, despite sweeping layoffs across several divisions earlier in this year. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, also slashed around 12,000 jobs — then around 6% of its workforce — at the beginning of 2023."

        "category": "world",
        "text": "Anwar Abdul Nabi perches on the edge of a bed at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza. Her eyes are sunken with grief.The young mother tenderly holds the fingers of her daughter, Mila. Just minutes ago, the 3-year-old girl died of starvation.“My daughter was taken into to God’s mercy, because of the lack of calcium, potassium and oxygen,” Nabi told CNN on Monday, as she cried into the arms of an elderly relative. “Suddenly, everything dropped, because she was not eating anything with iron, or eggs. She used to eat eggs every day before the war. Now nothing. She passed away.”As Israel’s severe restrictions on aid entering the Gaza Strip drain essential supplies, displaced Palestinians told CNN they are struggling to feed their children. Starving mothers are unable to produce enough milk to breastfeed their babies, doctors say. Parents arrive at overwhelmed health facilities begging for infant formula. Civilians have lost on average tens of kilograms of weight, according to relief workers. In northern Gaza, people rush to grab aid from infrequent humanitarian drops. Health workers say they cannot offer life-saving treatment to malnourished Gazans because Israel’s bombardment and siege has crushed the medical system.The Ministry of Health in Gaza said Tuesday that since the beginning of the war, 364 health workers had been killed; 269 medical staff arrested; 155 health facilities “destroyed,” and 155 ambulances “targeted.” CNN cannot independently confirm the numbers due to the lack of international media access to Gaza.Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the militant group Hamas killed at least 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 others in southern Israel on October 7.Since then, Israel’s attacks on Gaza have killed at least 30,717 Palestinians and wounded another 72,156 people, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave, while its siege has drastically diminished vital supplies and left the enclave’s population of some 2.2 million people exposed to high levels of acute food insecurity or worse, according to the Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Phase Classification (IPC), which assesses global food insecurity and malnutrition.At least 20 Palestinians have starved to death in Gaza, Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, said on Wednesday. The youngest baby who died of starvation in the enclave was one day old, according to Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan hospital. The true number could be even higher, as limited access to northern Gaza has hindered the ability of aid agencies to fully assess the situation there. UN experts accused Israel of “intentionally starving” Palestinians in Gaza. Israel insists there is “no limit” on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, but its inspection regime on aid trucks has meant that only a tiny fraction of the amount of food and other supplies that used to enter Gaza daily before the war is getting in now.One-year-old Watin, in northern Gaza, has grown tired and weak from dehydration. Instead of drinking baby formula, she is surviving on one to two dates a day.“She is only taking one meal,” said her father, Ikhlas Shehadeh, who struggles to scavenge enough food to feed his baby girl. “She spent a long time without any milk. This child is suffering from the inability to move,” he told CNN on Tuesday. “We do not know what to do.”The babies of thousands of women “who are due to give birth in the next month in the Gaza Strip are at risk of dying,” the UNICEF State of Palestine Humanitarian Situation report said on Tuesday. At least 5,500 pregnant women “do not have access to prenatal or postnatal check-ups because of bombings and need to flee for safety,” the report said.“Anxiety is also leading to premature births,” the report added, citing the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF.) The report also said over 90% of children “aged 6-23 months and pregnant, breastfeeding women face severe food poverty with access to two or fewer food groups per day.”Food shortages are reportedly the worst in northern Gaza, where Israel concentrated its military offensive in the early days of the war. Child malnutrition in the region is about three times higher than in southern Gaza, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Screenings at health facilities there have previously found at least one in six children under the age of two are acutely malnourished, said Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the territory. He warned those figures are “likely to be greater today.” Pregnant and breastfeeding women also face “grave threats to their health” caused by malnutrition, the Global Nutrition Cluster, an alliance of NGOs, reported in February.Dr. Muhammad Salha, acting director of Al-Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, told CNN medical workers are treating cases of dehydration, gastroenteritis, and hepatitis among women and children.“There are babies who died in their mothers’ wombs, and surgeries were performed to remove the dead fetuses,” he said on Monday. “Mothers are not eating because of the conditions we are living in, and this affects the infants … There are causes of many children suffering from dehydration and malnutrition, leading to death.”Israel’s bombardment has forcibly displaced at least 1.7 million Palestinians, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Many of those who fled the fighting are crammed into overwhelmed shelters without basic sanitation, leading to the spread of infections. Malnourished children, especially those with severe malnutrition, are at greater risk of dying from illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia, according to the World Health Organization.Another doctor in northern Gaza, Ahmad Salem, said patients in intensive care and neonatal units were dying from malnutrition and a lack of oxygen, which are difficult to administer amid fuel shortages. “We suffer from starvation of mothers,” the medical worker in the Kamal Adwan Hospital told CNN. “We cannot find an alternative to mother’s milk, which leads to the death of those children.”Mohammed Hamouda, a displaced health worker in Rafah, told CNN that his friend, a doctor at Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza, is unable to treat wounded patients because he is exhausted from hunger.“If the situation is still like this, in the next week or the next two weeks, I think many thousands of babies will die, and many thousands of elderly and pregnant women will die,” he added.Footage obtained by CNN shows scores of desperate civilians clambering over each other to grab ration packs from aid drops in northern Gaza.On Tuesday, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt sent 42 tons of medical supplies and food via airplanes in the region, the Emirati Ministry of Defense said. The US military said it had, alongside the Royal Jordanian Air Force, parachuted more than 36,800 meals into northern Gaza that day.But human rights groups criticized the drops as inefficient and a degrading way of getting aid to Gazans, urging Israeli authorities to lift controls on land crossings into the enclave. Melanie Ward, the CEO of the UK-based NGO, Medical Aid for Palestinians, urged Israel to “immediately open all crossings into Gaza for aid workers to assist those in need.”“Only safe and unfettered access for aid and aid workers, the lifting of the siege, and an immediate ceasefire can end starvation in Gaza,” she said in a statement on Saturday.Even when aid does make it into the strip, collecting it can be dangerous.Israeli forces opened fire on people waiting for aid on Monday in northern Gaza, eyewitnesses told CNN, in an incident that took place shortly before midnight at the Kuwait Roundabout on Rasheed Street in Gaza City. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.Last Thursday, at least 118 people were killed while trying to access food aid in Gaza City in one of the worst single tragedies of the war so far. Palestinian health officials said Israeli troops had used live fire as hungry and desperate Palestinian civilians were gathering around food trucks, with Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, referring to the incident as an “outrageous massacre.” The Israeli military said it first opened fire with warning shots for crowd control, before firing on “looters” who came toward them. Most of the dead were killed by ramming as aid truck drivers tried to escape the gunfire and chaos, eyewitnesses and the IDF both said. CNN is unable to independently confirm the figures.Faraj Abu Naji, whose sister gave birth to twin girls a week ago, managed to obtain just three cartons of milk for his newborn nieces in an aid drop in northern Gaza. He told CNN that he injured his foot while trying to buy flour along Al-Rashid Street.“We thank God that there is humanitarian aid being dropped from Jordanian and Emirati planes,” he said on Tuesday. “I try as much as possible to obtain milk from the planes that drop aid so that we can provide milk for my nieces for as long as possible.“Planes are dropping aid on northern Gaza, and we have become like dogs, running after a bone.”This story has been updated to correct Mila’s age.

        "category": "world",
        "text": "Gabriel García Márquez’s last novel, “Memories of My Melancholy Whores,” was published 20 years ago, but the late Colombian author’s legacy did not end there.After his death in 2014, an unfinished work — consisting of up to five drafts that the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature was working on during the last years of his life — remained in storage at his personal archive at the University of Texas.On Wednesday, the day García Márquez would have turned 97, the now-finished novel, “Until August,” was published by the author’s sons Rodrigo and Gonzalo García.But, as the pair acknowledge in the book’s preamble, García Márquez didn’t want the work to be released. “This book doesn’t work,” they recall their father telling them before his death. “It must be destroyed.”Having reviewed the manuscripts, his family determined that they contained the essence of the writer who has captivated so many readers for decades. In the book, García Márquez’s sons admit that publishing it was an act of “betrayal.” But Gonzalo told a press conference Tuesday that nothing had been added that was not included in the various drafts of the novel left by his father.“The novel was a little scattered in a certain number of originals, but it was complete,” he said, as the brothers presented the book at the Cervantes Institute in Madrid.“It is not as polished as his greatest books,” Rodrigo added: “But, as we say in the prologue, it definitely has many of (his) outstanding characteristics: beautiful prose, knowledge of the human being, power of description.”García Márquez worked on the novel for several years until he began to suffer from dementia. The Colombian author’s memory loss undermined his confidence in his work, his sons said.“He never kept unpublished books,” said Rodrigo. “Every book that he did not finish and that he was not satisfied with was destroyed. So, the fact that he did not destroy this book, I think, is also a sign that it became a little indecipherable for him. A Gabo (as García Márquez was affectionately known) completely in his right mind would have either finished the book, or destroyed it.”Set in an unidentified Caribbean location, “Until August” follows protagonist Ana Magdalena Bach as she makes an annual trip to the island where her mother is buried. Each year, while there, she “for one night takes a new lover,” according to a synopsis from the book’s publisher Penguin Random House, which described the novel as a “profound meditation on freedom, regret, self-transformation, and the mysteries of love.”The posthumous novel emerged from the manuscripts thanks to the fine-tuning of publisher and literary agent Cristóbal Pera, who edited the last two books García Márquez published during his lifetime.García Márquez’s sons have confirmed that there are no other unfinished novels in storage. “All of Gabo’s work is now available to his readers,” said Gonzalo."

        "category": "world",
        "text": "A dangerous winter storm is slamming Northern California with rare blizzard conditions and fierce winds as it threatens to unload up to 10 feet of snow in the mountains and snarl travel.In the Sierra Nevada, the storm is delivering heavy snow, reduced visibilities, toppled power lines and hurricane-force winds over 75 miles per hour, which are expected to roar through the weekend.Over three feet of snow has been measured so far, and an additional one to two feet is likely in higher elevations and six to 10 inches elsewhere, according to the National Weather Service.About a half million people are under blizzard warnings in the Mountain West, with another 6 million under winter weather alerts across the region.The weather service on Friday warned of “high to extreme” avalanche danger through Sunday afternoon in the Central Sierra and Greater Lake Tahoe area.The most extreme conditions are unfolding at the highest elevations, where snowfall rates could top three to five inches an hour through Saturday, threatening road closures and increasing the risk of avalanches.The ski resort Sierra-at-Tahoe in Twin Bridges, California, is closed after at least three to four feet fell at the top of the resort. An image shared with CNN shows how wind drift caused snow to pile up against the door of the resort’s maintenance shop. Another shows a car in the resort’s guest parking buried in snow that fell overnight.“We, along with most other resorts, will be closed today so our lift operations team can focus on clearing the roads,” Shelby Dunlap, communications manager at the resort, told CNN.Models are showing an additional 3 feet of snow at high elevations by Saturday morning, and blizzard conditions continuing through the day. Those blizzard conditions will move into eastern Nevada Saturday morning, and blizzard warnings are in effect from Saturday morning into Saturday evening.Extreme snowfall and roaring winds combining to produce long-lasting blizzard conditions for much of the Sierra and parts of the northern ranges will mean blowing snow and whiteout conditions, making travel “impossible,” the National Weather Service warned.Visibility has already plummeted to near-zero in some areas, meaning it’s impossible to see farther than a few feet, or at all.A stretch of Interstate 80 was shut down at the Nevada state line Friday as California Highway Patrol reported spin-outs and low visibility.According to an update from California Highway Patrol Truckee, I-80 remains closed Saturday between the Nevada state line and Colfax, California.“Last night, we had a mass amount of vehicles stuck over Donner Summit and it took several hours for emergency personnel and tow trucks to reach motorists,” the update said. “At one point, emergency personnel and tow trucks had a difficult time getting to motorists due to blizzard conditions.”Caltrans District 3, which maintains the state highway system in 11 Northern California counties, is currently evaluating the roads and CHP plans to work on recovering vehicles left on the freeway after motorists were transported to a safe location last night.“There is no estimated time of reopening the freeway, so we suggest you stay home. Stay warm and don’t put yourself and your family in a dangerous situation,” CHP added.Amtrak canceled the Friday departure of its California Zephyr service from Chicago to San Francisco, since it passes through Truckee, California, in the high country, which is under a blizzard warning until Sunday morning.Power outages are growing, with more than 39,000 homes and businesses without power in California Saturday morning, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us. The number is expected to jump sharply as winds strengthen. Some 16,000 customers are without power in Idaho and about 15,000 in Nevada, according to the site. Another 12 Wind alerts are posted across nine western states, covering nearly 20 million people.The National Weather Service in Reno said in addition to huge snow totals in the mountains, significant snow could fall at lower elevations, “even as much as 6-14 inches in the Reno-Carson-Minden corridor,” the office said in its forecast discussion.Even the Las Vegas area has a rare blizzard warning in effect for Lincoln County, Nevada, where they’re expecting 2 to 5 inches of snow with winds up to 70 mph, according to the Las Vegas weather service office.Yosemite National Park is closed at least through Sunday at noon, according to the National Park Service.A Blizzard Warning is in effect for the area of the park until Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service in Hanford, California. Higher elevations of the park could see 5-10 feet of snow in the coming days.Unlike other storms this winter, snow is falling well below pass levels for all impacted ranges. Close to a foot of snow is expected through the weekend for areas as low as 5,000 feet. Several inches are also possible for even lower elevations, including Reno, Nevada. Wind gusts of up to 60 mph will continue to blow through the lower elevations alongside snow.The intense conditions at lower elevations increase the risk of danger on the road.Travel will remain “extremely dangerous to impossible” across the Sierra through the weekend, the weather service warned.One upside of the storm will be its effect on the state’s water supply. Snowpack in some areas is already at 80% of the March average and could jump sharply.Recent storms have helped make a difference. Parts of the Sierra are closing in on erasing the snowpack deficit.The snowpack was at 80% of its March average, a survey conducted by California’s Department of Water Resources found Thursday – which represents what was on the ground before the current storm.The storm currently hitting the Sierra will be factored into the April snow survey. The April survey is viewed as the most consequential since officials use the measurement to forecast the state’s water resources for the rest of the year. The survey showed snowpack was 70% of the April average.Millions of people in the West depend on a melting snowpack in the warmer months for hydropower, irrigation and drinking water, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.CNN’s Mary Gilbert, Elliana Hebert, Sara Tonks Stephanie Elam contributed to this report."

        "title": "Sweden officially joins NATO, becoming alliance’s 32nd member",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Sweden officially joined NATO on Thursday after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine spurred it to rethink its defense policy and abandon its long held position of neutrality.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson formally handed over accession documents to the US State Department in Washington, DC, the final step of a months-long process to gain the approval of all members to allow his country to become the alliance’s 32nd member.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken received the documents, which he said were the product of “nearly two years of tireless diplomacy” by NATO members. The documents are put into a vault at the State Department, which serves as the treaty depositary for NATO.Sweden joining NATO was scarcely conceivable a little more than two years ago. The country remained neutral in both World Wars but when Russian troops began marching toward Kyiv in February 2022, Sweden – and its Nordic neighbor Finland – became alert to the threat Moscow could pose to nearby countries outside the alliance.Finland – which shares a 1,300 kilometer (830 mile) border with Russia – officially joined in April 2023, more than doubling NATO’s border with Russia in a blow to President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to stem any growth of the alliance.“If you step back and think of where we were three years ago, none of this was foreordained – and in fact, none of this was foreseeable,” Blinken said.Blinken noted Sweden’s “200-year-old policy of non-alignment” – which stretches back to the Napoleonic Wars – and the Swedish population’s lack of appetite to join the alliance before Russia’s invasion.“Then everything changed,” he said.US President Joe Biden heralded Sweden’s accession, which he said made the bloc “more united, determined and dynamic than ever,” and able to “stand for freedom and democracy for generations to come.”The move came just hours before Biden is set to deliver his State of the Union address, in which he is expected to draw sharp contrasts between his stance on issues of democracy and key alliances like NATO and that of his predecessor Donald Trump. Kristersson will be a guest of the First Lady at the address.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also welcomed the news, describing it as a “historic moment.”“Like Finland, Sweden shares our values and principles and they share our unwavering commitment to international security in the face of Russia’s threats and their barbaric war in Ukraine,” Sunak said. “Sweden and Finland’s membership will make NATO stronger and the whole Euro-Atlantic more secure.”Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sweden’s accession was a win for everyone, calling the country “a strong ally and a country that can be trusted.”“Ukraine has always supported Sweden in its pursuit of NATO membership, and I thank Sweden for its support of our country – there will be a day when Sweden will be able to congratulate Ukraine on joining the alliance as well. Together, we are always stronger,” he said.Kristersson thanked his allies for welcoming Sweden into the bloc.“We will strive for unity, solidarity and burden-sharing, and will fully adhere to the Washington Treaty values: freedom, democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law. Stronger together,” he said in a statement.While Finland became NATO’s 31st member without major obstacles, Sweden’s bid to join the bloc was for months obstructed by Turkey and Hungary, which enjoy friendly relations with Moscow and delayed ratifying Stockholm’s accession.Turkey’s parliament voted in January to approve Sweden’s bid after months of tensions between the two nations, sparked primarily by a spate of Quran-burning protests in Sweden that enraged Turkish lawmakers.But Hungary made Sweden wait even longer, with Prime Minister Viktor Orban declining to green-light its bid on several occasions. Hungary’s parliament eventually approved Sweden’s accession last month.NATO’s next annual summit will be held in July in Washington, DC, and will mark the alliance’s 75th anniversary."

        "title": "Navalny will be back, but only after Putin’s rule is over",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "The images were stirring: Alexey Navalny’s mourners lining up on Friday around the Church of the Icon of the Mother of God in Moscow’s Maryino district, risking arrest to pay final respects to a man they call their hero.Each red carnation clutched by a supporter of the Russian dissident can be seen as a small act of resistance in a country where the state has cleared the landscape of all political competition. And one of the chants of Navalny’s supporters at the funeral – ne prostim (we won’t forgive) – seemed directed at Russian President Vladimir Putin.But the fact that Navalny’s funeral went ahead, after two cruel weeks of bureaucratic delay and official obfuscation, is perhaps a sign of the Kremlin’s confidence. Its crackdown on dissent is so complete, and genuine political opposition so marginalized, that the event was allowed to take place. The funeral of Navalny was the funeral of the Russian opposition movement – for now.To be sure, a heavy contingent of police was on hand to make sure the event did not veer outside the boundaries of acceptable protest. Independent monitoring group OVD-Info reported that 91 people were arrested in 19 cities around Russia on the day of Navalny’s funeral, far fewer than the hundreds arrested on the day of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The full-scale invasion of Ukraine raised the stakes for public protest in Russia, introducing strict new criminal penalties for defaming the country’s military. Hundreds of thousands of Russians went into exile, many of whom were part of Navalny’s constituency. The person who has assumed the mantle of Navalny’s charismatic leadership – his widow, Yulia Navalnaya – is out of the country, and does not immediately present a direct political threat to Putin, who is poised to sail to re-election in two weeks. That all makes Friday’s turnout more remarkable, but what future is there for Navalny’s form of opposition?Navalny returned to Russia following his recovery from nerve-agent poisoning in 2021 precisely because he wanted to remain an active player in politics. And his form of digitally engaged activism continued, even as state prosecutors piled on charges against him.For that, he paid the price: Whatever the ultimate cause of his death in prison, Navalny’s term in a remote penal colony north of the Arctic Circle was designed to break him physically and psychologically.Behind bars, Navalny had remained a potent symbol of resistance, sending messages that poked fun at the prison administration. Even in death, his sense of humor and pop-culture savvy surfaced. Kira Yarmysh, his spokeswoman, noted that music from an Arnold Schwarzenegger blockbuster was played as his body was laid to rest.“Alexey considered Terminator 2 the best film on earth,” she wrote. “Music from the final scene was played at his funeral.”To quote the Terminator, Navalny will be back.“Schoolkids hear about heroes in schools but here we have a true hero which we were happy to work with through the years,” his longtime aide Maria Pevchikh said in a live YouTube broadcast on Friday. “Navalny will become a giant figure in Russian history,”But while Putin is in power, the anti-corruption activist’s name will not be seen on streets and squares. So how long Russian schoolchildren will wait for him to enter their history books is a very open question."

        "title": "Louisiana governor issues disaster declaration for crawfish shortage amid extreme weather and drought",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a disaster declaration Wednesday for the state’s critical crawfish industry, as extreme weather disrupted this year’s harvest and triggered a shortage of the tiny crustaceans.Louisiana is the country’s top producer of crawfish – a staple in Gulf Coast cuisine such as crawfish étouffée, gumbos and po-boys. The brick-red creatures have been harvested commercially in Louisiana since the 1800s, and the industry brings in ﻿more than $300 million for the state’s economy each year.Early estimates from Louisiana State University’s Agriculture Center showed potential losses to the state’s crawfish industry could be nearly $140 million for this year’s harvest season. But the economic blow could ultimately be higher, said Mark Shirley, a crawfish specialist at the center. While crawfish production has increased in recent months, the industry’s numbers remain “disastrously low,” he told CNN.The shortage also affected Mardi Gras. Carnival season usually attracts tourists to New Orleans from all over the world, where they tend to gorge on the state’s classic seafood boils that typically include pounds of freshly cooked crawfish. It’s also a popular staple during Lent season, when most of Louisiana’s Catholics seek seafood alternatives to meat.Mike Strain, commissioner of the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, lamented the blow to Mardi Gras this year in a late-February letter to the US Department of Agriculture that requested federal relief.“Mardi Gras 2024 was still celebrated, but this time without abundant and affordable crawfish,” Strain wrote. “For the first time in many years, due to sustained drought in 2023 and freezing temperatures in early 2024, crawfish are simply unavailable.”Last year’s severe dry spell and extreme heat, followed by freezing temperatures in early 2024, disrupted harvest season across the state, officials say. 2023 was the warmest year on record for Louisiana, with 75% of the state reaching exceptional drought — the highest in the nearly 25-year history of the drought monitor data.The drought, one of the most severe on record, made the ground too dry for crawfish to dig and lay eggs, Shirley said.Louisiana also grappled last year with saltwater intrusion on the Mississippi River, which contributed significant damage to the industry. Crawfish, which are freshwater creatures, are unable to tolerate high salt levels. Salt makes it difficult for the crawfish to breed, grow and survive.These combined effects led to a significant decline in crawfish populations in farms and in the wild, resulting in lower harvest yields and higher prices, according to the state’s Department of Agriculture and Forestry. The small yield greatly affect crawfish farmers, who rely on the season’s bountiful harvest, which begins in late November and lasts through the spring, for their income.“Louisiana’s extreme drought conditions have affected our farmers, our economy, and our way of life,” Landry said in the declaration. “All 365,000 crawfish acres in Louisiana have been affected by these conditions … The crawfish industry needs all the support it can get right now.”The state boasts more than 1,000 crawfish fishermen and over 1,300 crawfish farmers, who supply up to 120 million pounds of crawfish per year, according to the wildlife and fisheries department.“We have been monitoring the supply of crawfish, talking to many individual farmers as well as the buyers who purchase and deliver crawfish to markets within and outside of Louisiana,” Shirley said. “$140 million or so — that’s money going to small, rural communities in Louisiana that they’re not going to see this year.”"

        "title": "Iran announces record low election turnout despite calls on voters to participate",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Iran has recorded the lowest electoral turnout since the Islamic Republic’s founding in 1979, with officials portraying the participation of those who did vote as a victory against the country’s “obstinate opponents.”Out of Iran’s 61 million eligible voters, some 25 million cast their ballots in parliamentary and Assembly of Experts elections that took place on March 1, Iran’s state news outlet IRNA said.The announced turnout is not final, experts say. And while only 41% of voters came out, according to official data, “the real turnout is likely lower although it is impossible to know at this stage,” wrote Alex Vatanka, founding director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC, adding that “in this round, the vetting was among the most extreme.”Turnout was low despite Iran extending the voting time three times, and despite weeks-long efforts by officials to boost participation levels ahead of the polling date.The turnout also comes as Iranians grapple with a tumbling local currency, a crippled economy and widened crackdown on dissent, which rights groups say only intensified after the 2022 protest movement sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody.Iranian officials and state media however hailed the turnout as a triumph. The figure is a win against “the biggest election boycott campaign in the last 45 years,” said Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency on X, adding that the boycott was orchestrated by “foreign enemies and their internal followers.”President Ebrahim Raisi on Saturday told Iranians who voted that their participation was a “zealous blow to Iran’s obstinate opponents.”While not as low as some polls published in state media initially speculated, the turnout so far announced is lower than any legislative or presidential election held since the Islamic Republic’s founding in 1979.It is unclear if the announced 41% turnout will sink further in the coming days, with some candidates in the parliamentary election going to a runoff.Recent elections have generally seen increasingly low rates of voter participation. Iran’s last parliamentary election in 2020 saw a turnout of 42.57%, and its last presidential election in 2021 had a turnout of 48.8% – both were the lowest since the establishment of the Islamic Republic.Some 15,000 candidates competed last week for the 290-seat parliamentary election, and 144 ran for the 88 seats of the Assembly of Experts.Preliminary results show the election of mostly hardline politicians, including President Ebrahim Raisi who was re-elected to the Assembly of Experts – which has the power to appoint the Supreme Leader, the highest political authority in Iran.Several Iranians in Tehran have cited economic conditions and a lack of trust in leadership as reasons for not voting.In a shocking move, Iran’s former president Mohammad Khatami refused to cast his vote on March 1. The reformist president has previously urged the Iranian government to be more lenient with protesters amid the 2022 nationwide demonstrations. Azar Mansouri, an Iranian reformist politician, over the weekend confirmed Khatami’s refusal to vote.“His (Khatami) critical stance is indicative of the mood in the reformist camp that is by now nearly extinguished as a channel for criticism of Khamenei,” Vatanka wrote.International watchdogs previously slammed Iran for holding elections that are neither free nor fair, marked by a vetting process that restricts the types of candidates permitted to run.This year, Iran’s Guardian Council – a powerful 12-member council charged with overseeing elections and legislation – had disqualified thousands of candidates from running for parliamentary seats and barred former moderate President Hassan Rouhani from running for the Assembly of Experts.Other politicians who were once leading election charts saw their popularity drop. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Iran’s parliament speaker and former Revolutionary Guards air force commander, seemed to lose some votes, coming fourth in this year’s election after his popularity peaked in the 2020 parliamentary election.Ghalibaf’s fall down the chart shows that even among those who did vote, they are “taking a more striking position against perhaps incumbents and even pragmatic conservatives,” Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN.Vakil added that another sign of voter discontent was the high number of spoiled ballots, showing that there were protesters even among those who voted.“The real question now is what comes next,” Vatanka wrote, adding that for a majority of Iranians this election was “a referendum on the future of the Islamic Republic.”“Few reformists chose to or were able to run in these elections and those that did fared badly, marking the loss of the public’s faith in the ability of gradual reform in the Islamic Republic,” he added.This election “tells us where the system is,” Vakil told CNN, adding that in an attempt to maintain cohesion for succession and the existing composition of the Islamic Republic’s institutions, the system has been “purged” of elites who may have become more pragmatic or moderate over time."

        "title": "Fossilized trees dating back 390 million years are world’s oldest",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Scientists working in southwest England have found the oldest fossilized forest known on Earth, according to a new study.Dating back 390 million years, the fossils break the record held by a forest in New York state by 4 million years, reads a press release from the University of Cambridge published Thursday.The fossils were found in high sandstone cliffs on the southern side of the Bristol Channel near Minehead, close to the site of a holiday park.The trees, known as Calamophyton, look fairly similar to palm trees but had thin, hollow trunks. They didn’t have any leaves, but had twig-like structures covering their branches, study first author Neil Davies, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge’s Earth Sciences department, told CNN Thursday.They would reach up to 2-4 meters (6.6-13.1 feet) tall and shed branches as they grew.The forest dates from the Devonian Period, 419 million to 358 million years ago, when life was moving onto land.The trees would have trapped sediment in their root systems, stabilizing riverbanks and coastlines, Davies explained.“In doing so they are corralling water in certain locations and making these small channels,” he said. “They’re basically building the environment they want to live in rather than being passive.”The findings also reveal the speed with which early forests developed, said Davies.While the fossils in England are from a sparse forest with just one type of tree, the previous oldest forest in New York state had more variety of species, such as vine-like trees that grew on the ground, despite living just 4 million years later, he explained.“By comparing the Somerset flora with the New York flora you really see how rapidly things changed in terms of geological time,” said Davies.“Within a kind of geological blink of the eye you’ve got a lot more variety,” he added.The trees also provided a habitat for invertebrates living on the forest floor thanks to the twigs that would drop on the ground.The team found evidence of footprints and tail drags left by these early anthropods, said Davies.While scientists don’t know exactly what they were due to a lack of physical remains, the largest ones were around 5-10 centimeters (2-4 inches) wide, said Davies. “They’re sizeable,” he added.The team also found evidence that the arthropods would bury themselves in the sediment on the forest floor to prevent themselves drying out in the very warm, semi-arid climate, said Davies.At the time, the cliffs where the fossils were found, known as the Hangman Sandstone Formation, were connected to parts of what is now Germany and Belgium, rather than England.Similar fossils from pieces of wood washed out to sea have been found in these areas, which helped study co-author Christopher Berry, a palaeobotanist at Cardiff University’s School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, identify the fossils found in England.“It was amazing to see them so near to home. But the most revealing insight comes from seeing, for the first time, these trees in the positions where they grew,” he said in the release.“It is our first opportunity to look directly at the ecology of this earliest type of forest, to interpret the environment in which Calamophyton trees were growing, and to evaluate their impact on the sedimentary system.”None of this would have been possible without a huge stroke of luck, said Davies.“These were fortuitous findings,” he said, explaining that the team were in the area to investigate its general geology and had sat down for lunch in a field when they spotted the fossils.“We were surprised to find the forest because it’s a part of the world that has been looked at quite extensively and no one’s ever found these things,” he said.The study was published in the Journal of the Geological Society.Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

        "title": "Hong Kong unveils its second national security law, aligning city more closely with mainland China",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Hong Kong’s government unveiled a new suite of powerful national security laws on Friday that critics and foreign governments warn could deepen the ongoing crackdown in the city and further undermine its reputation as an international business hub.The 212-page draft bill tabled into the city’s opposition-less legislature introduces a range of new national security crimes including treason, espionage, external interference and disclosure of state secrets.The most serious offenses are punishable with up to life imprisonment, with the involvement of “external forces” – a byword for foreign governments and organizations – treated as an aggravating factor.China and Hong Kong’s leaders say the laws are needed as part of their drive to “restore stability” following huge and often violent democracy protests in 2019 and argue their legislation is similar to other national security laws around the world.Critics counter that what China’s Communist Party views as national security offences are far broader and more sweeping, often ensnaring political criticism, dissent and even business activity that would not be criminalized elsewhere.They point to the application of national security laws in mainland China as well as in Hong Kong where a Beijing-imposed national security law has already transformed the once outspoken city since 2020, silencing almost all dissent and jailing dozens of political opponents. Many civil society groups have disbanded, and outspoken media outlets have shut down.The new draft Hong Kong law – known locally as Article 23 – is aimed at “filling the loopholes” left by the Beijing-imposed version enacted in 2020, according to the Hong Kong government.A previous attempt to pass Article 23 laws back in 2003 sparked huge protests and a government u-turn.But the atmosphere in Hong Kong this time around is very different.Many of the city’s leading pro-democracy figures are in jail either convicted or facing charges under the 2020 national security law.Others have fled overseas, and the city’s once raucous legislature has been cleared of pro-democracy opposition politicians, resembling instead the type of rubber stamp bodies favored by the Chinese Communist Party on the mainland.Public consultations for the new laws this time lasted 28 days, two months short of the time given during the earlier attempt in 2003 when hundreds of thousands of residents hit the streets in protest.The government said 98% of the 13,147 pieces of feedback it received during the consultation period “showed support” for the new law and just 0.7% voiced opposition, including a dozen from what it called “overseas anti-China organizations or abscondees.”Hong Kong’s legislature convened special sessions for the first and second reading of the proposed bill on Friday and within three hours after it was tabled.They were prompted by Hong Kong’s leader John Lee – a former police officer and security chief – who told lawmakers to pass the law “at full speed.”“Completing the legislative work even one day earlier means we can more effectively safeguard national security one day earlier,” he said in a letter to the legislature on Thursday.Authorities have yet to announce when a third reading will take place.Last month, the United States warned Article 23 risks “compounding the 2020 National Security Law that has curtailed the rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong.”In a statement, the US Department of State said it was concerned by the “broad and vague definitions of ‘state secrets’ and ‘external interference,’” which could potentially be used to silence dissent, and some of the provisions that may have extraterritorial effects."

        "category": "world",
        "text": "Blizzard conditions continued to slam Northern California over the weekend with damaging winds and heavy snow dumping on mountain ridges down to the valleys.The most extreme conditions are unfolding at the highest elevations in the mountains, with whiteout conditions and hurricane-force winds.Winter storm alerts remain across most western states, with blizzard warnings still in effect for the the northern and central Sierra Nevada until Monday morning, where up to 1 foot of snowfall and gusts of 45-75 mph are possible. Gusts across the Sierra Nevada peaks could still reach up to 90 mph.Although the heaviest snowfall will largely subside across the West on Monday, lingering rounds of moderate snowfall could still fall across parts of the Intermountain West into Tuesday, with additional snowfall potentially approaching a foot. More winter weather alerts could still be issued, with snowfall not expected to be as substantial as was seen over the weekend.The snow has closed a 70-mile stretch of Interstate 80 near the Nevada state line for more than a day after highway officials reported stranded drivers Friday night.Some areas of the Sierra saw more than 7 feet of snow in a 72-hour period, according to the National Weather Service, including Sugar Bowl, California, which received 89 inches (7.42 feet) and Donner Peak, California, which got 87 inches (7.25 feet).The Palisades Tahoe Ski Base registered a wind gust Sunday of 145 mph, while the Sagehen Creek Field Station saw one of 138 mph.Fewer than 8,600 homes and businesses were without power in California on Sunday evening, down from nearly 40,000, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us.Numerous ski fields and chairlifts remained closed Sunday, including at Palisades Tahoe, Sierra-at-Tahoe and Mammoth.The ski resort Sierra-at-Tahoe in Twin Bridges shared images with CNN of snow piling up against the door of the resort’s maintenance shop and a car in the resort’s guest parking buried in snow that fell overnight.“The intensity of the snow and high winds along the Sierra Nevada as well as across the Intermountain West will gradually wane through Monday. However, reinforcing upper-level energies arriving from the Pacific (will) keep the unstable cold air mass in place across a large section of the western US,” the National Weather Service said in its forecast discussion Sunday afternoon.Extreme snowfall and roaring winds in the Sierra and parts of the northern ranges mean blowing snow and whiteout conditions were making travel “impossible,” the National Weather Service warned.The storm forced the closure of the main road to Mammoth Mountain ski resort, US 395, for hours Saturday due to whiteout conditions, according to the California Department of Transportation.The snowy and windy conditions left some vehicles stuck on the road on Friday, with some motorists in need of rescue, according to the highway patrol office Truckee, which reported a “mass amount of vehicles stuck over Donner Summit.”“At one point, emergency personnel and tow trucks had a difficult time getting to motorists due to blizzard conditions,” the agency said.Many other roadways in the area are closed due to the weather and some are being chain controlled, requiring vehicles to have chains to proceed on the roadways.The California Highway Patrol posted a photo Saturday afternoon of one of its cars stuck in snow. “Even our officers sometimes get stuck in the snow! The blizzard-like conditions have yet to let up, but nonetheless, our officers are working hard to keep everyone safe. Avoid travel during this time and stay updated on road conditions,” it said on Facebook.On Sunday morning, the highway patrol in Truckee shared video of snowy conditions and low visibility on a stretch of I-80, which remained closed on Sunday at Colfax and the Nevada state line as of 7:53 p.m. Pacific Time.The severe winter storm conditions in Northern California posed issues for crews working Sunday to clear roadways of snow, which damaged some equipment.“We have been down to two of 10 blowers at our central hub in Kingvale and six out of 20 from Auburn to the Nevada state line,” California Department of Transportation officials said in a post on X.In the South Lake Tahoe area, a snowslide trapped vehicles and briefly shut down Highway 50 Sunday morning. There were no injuries and crews quickly reopened the road, officials said.Yosemite National Park, which closed Friday due to the storm, partially reopened to visitors Sunday afternoon, park officials announced on Facebook.“Expect snowy conditions throughout the park,” park officials said.Park officials warned visitors tire chains may be required for their vehicles and to check road conditions."

        "text": "Hamas said Tuesday there could be no “exchange of prisoners” before a permanent ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as it responded to proposals from Egyptian and Qatari mediators.“The security and safety of our people will not be achieved except through a permanent ceasefire, the end of the aggression, [Israel’s] withdrawal from every inch in Gaza…and the entry of aid to our people in Gaza is our utmost priority,” Hamas senior leader Osama Hamdan told a news conference in Beirut.“Any prisoner exchange will not be completed except after the completion of all this.”Hamas’ response comes as negotiators race to reach a deal that would pair a pause in fighting with the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Whether that deadline can be met remains uncertain. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously ruled out stoping the military campaign before Hamas is completely destroyed.Hamdan on Tuesday also accused Israel of stalling on reaching an agreement and warned that the negotiations would not be “open-ended” as Israel continues its offensive in Gaza.“We have affirmed our conditions for a ceasefire: complete withdrawal from the sector, the return of displaced persons to the areas they left, especially in the north, and the provision of sufficient aid, relief, and reconstruction,” he said.Reuters and Al Jazeera reported last week that Hamas was reviewing a draft proposal for an initial ceasefire lasting roughly six weeks, during which 40 Israeli hostages would be exchanged for 400 Palestinian prisoners.Hamdan’s response came just hours after US President Joe Biden said a potential ceasefire was “in the hands of Hamas” as he boarded Air Force One at Hagerstown airport.Biden said the “Israelis have been cooperating” and that a ceasefire is necessary.“We need a ceasefire,” he said, calling the deal on the table a “rational offer” and saying the Israelis had agreed to it.“We have to see what Hamas does,” he said.The Biden administration has been racing against the clock to secure a ceasefire before Ramadan, which is expected to begin March 10, fearing any aggressive military push by Israel during the Muslim holy month would only further inflame tensions across the region.Biden said Tuesday that without a deal by Ramadan, the situation in Israel and specifically Jerusalem would be “very, very dangerous.”Negotiators have been gathered in the Egyptian capital Cairo since Sunday for talks on a deal, but Israel did not send a delegation, an Israeli official told CNN, despite increasing international pressure to end hostilities and allow for a desperately needed surge of humanitarian aid.An Israeli official told CNN that the reason behind the decision was that Hamas had not responded to two Israeli demands: a list of hostages specifying which are alive and which are dead; and confirmation of the ratio of Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli prisons in exchange for hostages.When Biden was asked about his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he said it was “like it’s always been.” And he repeated his assertion there were “no excuses” for Israel not to allow more aid into Gaza.The US has become increasingly vocal about the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, where the United Nations warns hundreds of thousands of people are on the brink of famine and US ally Israel continues to obstruct the bulk of aid deliveries.On Saturday, the US made its first humanitarian airdrop into the strip — 66 bundles containing meals but no water or medical supplies, a US official said. Aid groups have criticized the air drops as an ineffective and degrading way to get aid to Palestinians in Gaza, with the International Crisis Group’s UN director saying they are at best a “temporary Band-Aid measure.”One of the strongest rebukes of Israel by a US official to date came from US Vice President Kamala Harris, who on Sunday forcefully called for more humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying that people in the region are “starving” in the face of “inhumane” conditions and urged Israel to do more.This is a developing story and will be updated."

        "title": "Lusail Towers: Norman Foster on how to ‘reinvent the tall building’",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Lord Norman Foster, renowned as one of the world’s foremost architects, has dedicated decades to redefining the concept of tall buildings. His portfolio boasts iconic structures such as London’s 30 St Mary Axe (better known to Londoners as the “Gherkin”) and the HSBC building in Hong Kong. Now, he’s set his sights on Qatar.Currently nearing completion and set to reach a height of 301 meters (988 feet), Foster’s Lusail Towers are poised to claim the title of Qatar’s tallest buildings, surpassing the current record holder, The Torch Doha.Part of a 1.1 million-square-meter project conceived by Foster + Partners, the towers’ construction is a pivotal component of the larger masterplan for the city of Lusail, situated 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of the capital, Doha.Breaking ground in January 2020, the Lusail Towers stand amidst a plethora of new developments in the area, including Lusail Stadium, also designed by Foster + Partners for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Comprising four distinctive blocks, two standing at 70 stories and two at 50 stories, each tower is intended to serve as a hub for Qatar’s financial institutions.“As an architect, I find myself engaging with cities in their infancy,” Foster said. “We’ve made a mark for what is essentially a new district, laying down infrastructure for future generations.”To address the unique challenges presented by Qatar’s hot climate, Foster’s team had to depart from the materials commonly used in skyscrapers in cooler countries – part of what Foster called a decades-long quest to “reinvent the tall building.”“You think so many times of the tower being a glass tower, but (with) the whole climate here and the issue of sustainability … you really want to defend against solar gain,” he added.The design incorporates advanced shading and ventilation, while the towers’ exteriors are coated with “marine-grade” aluminum that wraps around the buildings, protecting the glass from strong sunlight while maintaining the views and still letting in natural light.Central to the project are special shading fins, akin to gills, which not only optimize views and natural lighting for occupants but reduce solar radiation by 70% compared to traditional all-glass towers.“What we’ve done here is create a sense of identity drawn from real needs,” Foster said. “It’s not a fashionable imposition, it’s generated from the realities of the climate.”According to Luke Fox, project lead and senior executive partner at Foster + Partners, this shading system contributes to a 35% reduction in cooling requirements and overall energy consumption.The towers are strategically placed to create maximum shading, and as they rise their shape shifts by rotating 90 degrees.“We made sure that the towers were deliberately placed to rotate slightly, providing perspectives between them as they rise above ground level. It’s quite unique. They appear as distinct entities,” Fox said.While the towers are poised to become a recognizable landmark for Lusail, Foster believes that a city’s skyline reflects what lies beneath the surface. He says it was crucial for his team to integrate the towers into a “low-scale master plan.”They are strategically positioned on top of a metro line and at the end of a commercial boulevard linking the waterfront to the nearby football stadium, which recently hosted the final of AFC Asian Cup.According to Foster, the ground features of the plaza will be instrumental in the overarching objective of transforming the area into a vibrant public space for the future.“What isn’t always apparent from those distant views is the pedestrian experience. It’s the lower infrastructure that binds these diverse elements together,” Foster said.The Lusail Towers are set to be completed in phases over the next 12 months."

        "title": "Dr. Kwane Stewart, who cares for the pets of those experiencing homelessness, is CNN’s Hero of the Year",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Dr. Kwane Stewart — a veterinarian whose nonprofit, Project Street Vet, provides medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness — is the 2023 CNN Hero of the Year.Online voters selected him from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes.“I’ve wanted to be a veterinarian my whole life, since I was a child,” Stewart said when accepting the award. “I’m so lucky to be doing what I’m doing.”Stewart’s outreach on the streets started more than a decade ago. On a whim, the veterinarian stopped to examine the dog of a homeless man outside a 7-11 where he got his coffee.Stewart treated the dog’s skin condition and the animal was transformed. But for Stewart, the man’s gratitude was a wakeup call: “Thank you for not ignoring me” were the words that Stewart says inspired his next chapter.“It doesn’t matter what your situation is … I see a pet in need, and I see a person who cares for them dearly who just needs some help,” Stewart said.As CNN Hero of the Year, Stewart will receive $100,000 to expand his work and will also be named an Elevate Prize winner which comes with $300,000 in unrestricted funding and resources from The Elevate Prize Foundation.He and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award along with donation-matching up to $50,000 from The Elevate Prize Foundation. The foundation will also provide organizational and capacity-building support to all of the honorees.Stewart had spent several years working in a county shelter in Northern California when he thought about quitting in 2011. He’d long dreamed of saving animals but was instead forced to euthanize an increasing number of those that were being surrendered.“It was the recession. I’m seeing hordes of unwanted pets dropped off, people who don’t have the money to feed them or care for them medically,” Stewart, 53, said. “It started to steal a part of my soul. I thought about leaving the veterinary profession altogether.”Stewart was at a crossroads, he said, desperately trying to lower the shelter’s rates of euthanasia and increase adoption rates, but also struggling with the sheer number of animals dropped off there.Project Street Vet came about after his encounter with the homeless man and his dog outside the 7-11.“That was the moment I said to myself, ‘I’m going to do more of this. I’m going to get back to saving animals on my terms. And I’m going to do it for passion, not for pay.’”“It was my way to heal,” said Stewart. “Maybe some of it was guilt. Maybe some of it was I just wanted my own little crusade.”Soon after, Stewart began to do more outreach, setting up small drop-in clinics to provide medical care to pets whose owners couldn’t afford it and walking the streets looking for unhoused individuals whose pets needed help. Right away he was struck by how much the pet owners cared for their beloved animals.“They’re with each other 24/7 hours a day. Their bond and relationship is on a different level,” Stewart said. “Because they’re not in a traditional home, it doesn’t necessarily make them less of a pet parent. A pet doesn’t care about nice furniture and a big home, they want to spend it with you.”He found that many pet owners wanted to share their stories about their dog and their history together.With their consent, Stewart’s brother, Ian, eventually began documenting some of the work and personal stories to raise awareness about animal welfare and homelessness.“They probably get criticized more than anything, especially from people in the outside world. But I’ve seen people give up their last meal for their pet and people who have $3 to their name, and after I’m done with the treatment, they will try and give me that $3,” Stewart said.His brother encouraged him to spread the word and join forces with others to provide street care, and soon more like-minded animal welfare professionals jumped on board.Genesis Rendon, a registered veterinary nurse who Stewart calls his “right-hand,” had worked in the veterinary field for nearly two decades and was doing her own street outreach when she teamed up with him in 2016.Today, as a lead volunteer for Project Street Vet, she is often by Stewart’s side in homeless camps and on Los Angeles’ Skid Row assisting animals in need.“Now it’s spreading across the country,” Stewart said. “I’m building a network of trusted volunteers, technicians with hospitals and clinics we can call on. These are all people who just reached out and said, ‘I’m inspired by what you do. How do I do it?’”Stewart says they can treat about 80% of the cases they see out of a small portable kit. Treatments include antibiotics, vaccines, and anti-inflammatories as well as deworming and flea and tick medications.“It’s boots on the ground,” Stewart said, adding that their group will also help connect animals in need to clinic services. “And whenever we can, we advocate for or assist people in getting their animals spayed and neutered.”Stewart’s work with Project Street Vet is all volunteer, and the organization has expanded to other cities, including Orlando and Atlanta.“It doesn’t matter what your situation is or what your background or past is, I see a pet in need, and I see a person who cares for them dearly who just needs some help. … It’s at no cost to them. It’s free.”Since he started, Stewart and his volunteer teams have treated thousands of animals while giving their human parents hope and dignity, too.“I will say this about the people I’ve met who have pets on the streets,” he said. “They are some of the most remarkable pet parents I’ve ever met.”If you’re inspired to help, you can donate to Stewart and each of the Top 10 CNN Heroes’ causes.You can donate to Stewart’s Project Street Vet and all the Top 10 CNN Heroes’ nonprofit organizations on CNNHeroes.com. The Elevate Prize Foundation is matching donations made directly through CNNHeroes.com up to $50,000 per Hero."

        "title": "‘We were not allowed to cry:’ Released Israeli hostage describes the ‘hell’ of being held in Gaza",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "An Israeli woman taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza has described the “hell” of being held captive, after her husband and daughter were murdered, telling CNN her captors would not allow her surviving young children to cry and tried to convince them they “had been forgotten.”Chen Almog Goldstein, who was kidnapped with her surviving children during Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel, said they were held in tunnels and an apartment in Gaza until their release after 51 days.“They humiliated us, sometimes mocking us,” she told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. “They told us that we had been forgotten, that the only important thing for Israel was fighting.“We were not allowed to cry, they wanted us to be happy … If we cried, we had to snap out of it or hide it,” she said. “It’s a kind of emotional abuse that they didn’t let us cry.”Almog Goldstein witnessed her husband Nadav and her oldest daughter Yam murdered by Hamas gunmen, who broke into their home near the border with Gaza on October 7.“I took Yam’s large teddy bear, the size of a human, and put it on top of us to protect us from the shooting,” she told Amanpour. “Within a few seconds, five of them came into the safe room, screaming, (and) as I turned around Nadav was shot in the chest, point blank.”Moments later her daughter was shot in the face, and Almog Goldstein was bundled into a family car along with her three surviving children, and driven across the border. She recalled the two Hamas militants in the car taking selfies as they drove back to Gaza.Hamas’ attacks on October 7 killed around 1,200 Israelis, with more than 200 people taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel believes that 99 people are still being held in Gaza, along with the bodies of 31 dead hostages.Almog Goldstein and her surviving children were released in late November, as part of a swap for Palestinian prisoners in Israel during a four-day truce in the war.While in captivity, she said the family survived on little water and food each day. “They tried to provide us with food. There was more in the beginning, but there was less later,” she said.She said they feared they would be killed either by their captors or in the “incredible bombardment” on Gaza by Israeli forces.And she described intense supervision by the family’s captors. “Agam used to sit down and stare, and they would say, what are you staring at? What are you thinking? There was no personal space.”“You need to understand they took our identity; it was extremely difficult for us.”“They talked to us about Gilad Shalit [the captured soldier held by Hamas for five years] and laughed,” she said. “They told us that we had been forgotten, that the only important thing for Israel was fighting.”Almog Goldstein said she and her children discussed religion with their captors and tried to keep the relationship amicable. “Sometimes we saw them crying, worried about their wives, and writing letters to their wives.”She urged the release of the remaining hostages, asking Amanpour: “(Are) we, as a society and the world, doing everything for them? I can testify that it is hell there.”More than 30,000 people have died in Gaza since Israel waged war against Hamas five months ago, but recent efforts to bring about a ceasefire that would allow the release of the remaining hostages have been frustrated.On Thursday two American officials agreed that the prospects are not promising of Israel and Hamas agreeing to a temporary truce by the start of Ramadan early next week. “Hope is fading,” one US official said."

        "title": "A tech company is growing diamonds in the desert",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Diamonds are the hardest material on Earth — and finding one in nature is comparably tough.For thousands of years, humans have dug deep into the Earth in search of diamonds, creating some of the world’s largest manmade pits in Russia and South Africa that descend as much as 625 meters (2,050 feet) below the ground.The intensive process has an impact on both nature and people, with dangerous working conditions and practices that damage ecosystems.But mining isn’t the only way to source diamonds. The first lab-grown diamond (LGD) was produced in the 1950s, according to the International Gem Society, and the technology has continued to develop, enabling labs to grow gem-quality crystals at affordable prices — up to 80% cheaper — without the sustainability and ethical concerns of mining.And growing diamonds artificially means you can bring diamond production to the most unexpected places — including the desert.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a global leader in diamond imports and exports, but it does not have any diamond mines. So entrepreneur Mohamed Sabeg saw an opportunity to not just trade diamonds, but grow them.In 2022, he co-founded Dubai-based 2DOT4 Diamonds, becoming the first to produce, cut, and polish lab-grown diamonds in the UAE.“Our idea was to bring the mine to the consumer,” says Sabeg. “Instead of having diamonds flying all around the world, the diamond is produced and sold locally.”The company’s name, 2DOT4, comes from the refractive index of a diamond —the speed at which light passes through a diamond compared to air, which is approximately 2.4 times slower.For Sabeg, having a name that relates to a physical property of the gem is a representation that the pieces produced in a lab are identical to the ones in nature.“The only difference is that we control the pressure, we control the heat, we control the gases,” he says. “The mined diamond, you don’t control it, the Earth is doing it.”To grow a diamond, you start with a diamond, either lab-grown or mined, explains Sabeg. It’s called a “seed” and is usually around 0.3 to 0.6 millimeters thick. (2DOT4 makes its own seeds from the diamonds grown in-house.)Placed inside a reactor, the seed is exposed to gases such as hydrogen, methane, oxygen, and argon. It also undergoes a pressure of up to 180 torrs —around two-thirds of the pressure at the peak of Mount Everest — and reaches temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees Fahrenheit). In this way, carbon is slowly deposited onto the thin slice.Then, it’s a matter of time for it to grow in volume.“You decide the speed of growth by using different parameters: the lower your speed is, the better your quality will be,” explains Sabeg.On average, 2DOT4 grows its diamonds at a speed of around 0.01 millimeters per hour. This means that every 24 hours, the stone grows in length comparable to the thickness of two sheets of paper.Once the diamond has grown to at least five millimeters in height, the piece is called a “block,” and there are three possible outcomes. It can be sliced into more seeds, that will be fed back into the reactors to grow more diamonds. Or, based on demand, 2DOT4 will cut and polish the gem. It can then either be sold to jewelers and designers, or turned into a jewelry piece designed in-house.Currently, the US, China, and India dominate LGD production, with the latter two accounting for over two-thirds of global output, according to Paul Zimnisky, a diamond industry analyst and consultant based in the US.Besides jewelry, lab-grown diamonds are used in multiple industries, particularly when it comes to making tools that cut through dense materials such as concrete, marble, and metals.For example, China has “a multi-decade legacy of producing synthetic diamond for abrasive industrial application, so they have the know-how and the infrastructure to be a major producer of man-made diamond for jewelry as well,” explains Zimnisky.India, on the other hand, has been a long-standing leader in diamond cutting and polishing, and embraced LGD technology to jump into production, too. Last year, the country underwent a tax reform in the sector and pledged extra funding to further expand its man-made diamond industry.Given the UAE’s status as a top diamond trading hub and its diversification efforts away from oil, expanding into the lab-grown diamonds industry could be an important move for its economy, says Ahmed Bin Sulayem, CEO and executive chairman of the Dubai Multi Commodities Center (DMCC), a global trade hub that held the very first Lab-Grown Diamond Symposium.“With the rise of the LGD industry symbolizing the intersection of technology and trade, the potential it holds is monumental, [and] we are excited to see Dubai positioned as a pioneering force in this transformative era,” says Bin Sulayem.“Sixty years ago, if you tell someone this is a synthetic or a lab-grown diamond, they won’t even look at it,” he adds. But younger generations are more concerned about ethical and environmental issues associated with mining, and are drawn towards the affordability of luxury goods, “so the industry has to adapt,” he adds.Entering the LGD production space could be a challenge, though. According to Zimnisky, competing with India and China will be difficult at scale, “unless you have a competitive advantage, or have a niche or specialized business.”Other UAE companies are following 2DOT4 and setting up their LGD business in Dubai, including Eviqe Diamonds, a part of HRA Group, which set up its production facility in the Emirate just a few months ago. Meanwhile, local brands such as Etika and Eayni are marketing their designs using lab-grown gems only.For the DMCC, the goal is to encourage the entire production to be done in-house, as a way of adding value to the final product and strengthening the local industry.“The key message we are giving to the lab-grown diamond industry is, don’t waste your time on selling the diamonds: focus on the final art,” says Bin Sulayem.For Sabeg, the hope is that 2DOT4’s creations are laying the foundation for the future of LGD production in a country that currently imports more diamonds than anywhere else in the world.“Our way of looking at what we are doing is to set a standard in the industry,” he says."

        "category": "world",
        "text": "China’s top diplomat hit out at Washington’s “bewildering” trade policy during a news conference Thursday on the sidelines of a political gathering in Beijing, where Chinese leaders have been championing high-tech development in the face of mounting curbs from Washington.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused the US of “devising various tactics to suppress China” and said Washington’s “lengthening” unilateral sanctions list had reached “bewildering levels of unfathomable absurdity.”“If it gets jittery whenever it hears the word China, where is its confidence as a major country?” Wang said in a response to a question about trade with the US and technological restrictions.“If it only wants itself to prosper, but denies other countries legitimate development, where is international fairness? If it persistently monopolizes the high end of the value chain and keeps China at the low end, where is fairness and competition?”Wang made the comments during an annual Foreign Minister’s briefing held during each “two sessions” gathering of China’s rubber stamp legislature and its top political advisory body. Though highly choreographed, the more than hour-long engagement is a key opportunity for China’s top diplomat to express the country’s foreign policy vision directly to reporters from media around the world.In a stark contrast to his comments on the US, Wang praised China’s burgeoning relationship and record trade with Russia – highlighting this near the top of his press conference when a Russian state media reporter was the first question taken from a foreign reporter.Wang’s comments on the US come as Washington continues its drive to narrow the kinds of high-end technology that can be accessed by China. In October, the White House further reduced the types of semiconductors that US companies can sell in China as it aims to ensure American tech won’t be used to bolster the Chinese military.The US has also enacted sanctions against Chinese actors over a host of issues in recent years, including allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the illicit fentanyl trade and providing support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Wang spoke during what has been a period of relative stability between the China and the US. Adopting a softer tone at times, Wang noted that there had been “some improvements” in the US-China relationship since a summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in San Francisco last November.He called on Washington to work with Beijing “to bring the relationship back on the track of stable, sound and sustainable development.”What has been on the agenda at the meetings this week is China’s drive to bolster its “self-reliance and strength in science and technology,” with Beijing sending a message that it will boost its self-reliance rather than sit back and wait for tech frictions with the US to improve.The government announced plans to increase its annual budget for science and technology by 10% to an unprecedented 370.8 billion yuan ($51.6 billion) — the biggest jump since 2019 after years of minimal growth.Wang also praised robust trade ties between China and Russia, which have deepened following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine and Moscow’s subsequent economic isolation on the global stage.Bilateral trade between China and Russia hit a historic $240 billion last year, surpassing a target of $200 billion set by Xi and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in 2019 ahead of schedule.“Russian natural gas is fueling numerous Chinese households and Chinese-made automobiles are running on Russian roads,” Wang said. “All this shows the strong resilience and broad prospects of China-Russia mutually beneficial cooperation.”Beijing’s ties to Moscow have sparked deep suspicion in the West, including over concerns about China’s position as the Kremlin’s key economic lifeline. While China claims neutrality in the Ukraine conflict it has appeared unwilling to use its significant economic leverage to curb Russia’s aggression and has not condemned the invasion.During the briefing, Wang repeated China’s call for peace talks to avoid an “unthinkable” escalation and deterioration of the conflict. He also reiterated past rhetoric framing China’s relationship with Russia as a responsible one.Maintaining and growing the China-Russia relationship is a “strategic choice” by the two sides based on their fundamental interests and is also “what we must do to keep pace with the trend of the world,” Wang said.“China and Russia have forged a new paradigm of major country relations that differs entirely from the obsolete Cold War approach on the basis of non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party,” he added.The diplomat also addressed simmering tensions in the disputed South China Sea where non-lethal but increasingly tense clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in recent months have raised concerns about the risk of conflict, which could then embroil the United States, a Philippine mutual defense ally.Those flared again Tuesday when the Philippines Coast Guard accused Chinese vessels of executing “dangerous maneuvers” to impede and obstruct a resupply mission in contested waters in the South China Sea.CNN reporters were on board one of the Philippine Coast Guard vessels and witnessed how a much larger force of Chinese coast guard ships and boats from its shadowy “maritime militia” penned in a smaller convoy of Philippine vessels resupplying a remote military outpost.Despite an international tribunal rejecting China’s claim of historic rights to the bulk of the sea, it has continued to militarize islands and maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels to enforce its claims.“In the face of deliberate infringement, we will take justified actions to defend our rights in accordance with the law. In the face of unwarranted provocation, we will respond with prompt and legitimate countermeasures,” Wang said Thursday.“We also urge certain countries outside the region, not to make provocations, excite or stir up troubles,” he said, in an apparent jab at the US presence in the region.The foreign minister’s comments on Taiwan also caught the notice of those closely watching for any evolution of Chinese policy on Taiwan during the “two sessions” meeting.China’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its territory, despite never having controlled it. It has not ruled out the use of force to retake the island, which maintains close unofficial ties with the US.Some observers had noted that a line in a report delivered by Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday proclaimed that China would advance the cause of “China’s reunification” instead of saying “peaceful reunification” as it has been written at times in the past.On Thursday, when responding to a question about Taiwan’s recent election of Lai Ching-te, whose party views Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation under threat from China, Wang specifically called for the support of “peaceful reunification.”He also reiterated staid language that “whoever in the world” supports Taiwan independence will get “burned for playing with fire.”This story has been updated."

He has been king of Norway since 1991, and is Europe’s oldest monarch.His next official engagement, where he is due to preside over the Council of State at the Royal Palace, is scheduled to take place on March 8, according to the royal household’s website."

        "category": "world",
        "text": "When Helena Bonham Carter walked onto the set of 2012’s Dark Shadows movie, she was stinking of bourbon whiskey and Gauloises cigarettes.Her character was a chain-smoking alcoholic psychiatrist, but Bonham Carter hadn’t gone “method”; she had simply spritzed herself with a bespoke fragrance created specifically for her by fragrance designer Azzi Glasser.Having met by chance at their children’s school gates in London, the two have collaborated on countless projects over the years, beginning with the 2009 period drama “Enid,” for which Glasser concocted a perfume that evoked “stale white face powder that immediately took me back to the 1950s,” recalled Bonham Carter who was playing author Enid Blyton.Glasser has also fashioned a dark blend of foxglove, poison hemlock and belladonna for Bellatrix Lestrange in the “Harry Potter” films, a chocolate chilli-scented fragrance for the Red Queen character in “Alice in Wonderland,” and what Glasser describes as a mixture of “old, cracked soap with a ‘pissy’ note to it” for the role of Miss Havisham in 2012’s “Great Expectations.”“Helena couldn’t wait to get into rehearsals with that one,” said Glasser who is famed for having one of the best ‘noses’ in the business and prides herself on elevating an A-lister’s presence through her visceral scent blends.Born in the UK, Glasser spent her early formative years in India before returning to London. She worked for British fragrance house CPL Aromas for 20 years before creating the iconic Agent Provocateur fragrance in 2000, and in 2016, founded her own brand, The Perfumer’s Story by Azzi. Now, a bespoke fragrance from Glasser can cost up to £15,000 ($19,000), though she also offers a lower-priced collection of fragrances to enable people to discover their own fragrance DNA.Her roster of celebrity clients include actors Alicia Vikander, Noomi Rapace, Damian Lewis, Orlando Bloom, and Stephen Fry, as well as musicians Kylie Minogue and Adam Lambert. But it was Bonham Carter who introduced her “secret perfumer” to a curious Johnny Depp on the set of “Dark Shadows.” Depp promptly instructed Glasser to create a bespoke scent for his own character, a vampire called Barnabas, and they continued to work together. “Azzi possesses a certain sorcery in that she is capable of capturing the perfect essence of a character in scent,” he said of Glasser’s work.The perfumer believes that fragrance helps to truly understand the essence of a character. “We’ll meet up to talk about the role, the styling, who the director is, who the other actors are, the space, atmosphere, where they might be filming, whether it will be cold or hot… There are many elements at play. I’ll then go and start trialing and tweaking (the scent) until it’s absolutely perfect. I have never had anyone say, ‘no, it’s not quite right’,” said Glasser who can spend anything from a week to three months to create a custom-made scent.The result is not always positively fragrant, as with Jude Law’s depiction of an aging, ulcerated Henry VIII in the upcoming movie Firebrand.“I worked with Jude on “The Young Pope.” He came to the studio and told me, ‘I want to smell exactly like Henry.’ I told him, you know it’s going to smell repulsive, right?”The result was a heady brew of smells evoking gout, bad breath and excrement.“It was interesting because the other actors were affected by his presence, this power and manipulative stinkiness, as in real life. Whereas Henry could just (mask his own scent by) sniffing a handkerchief that smelt of rose.”Brad Pitt is on her wish list of collaborators, alongside Julia Roberts and Leonardo DiCaprio, although she has made headway with the latter, she revealed.“I met him at (a London restaurant) recently and he gave me his number,” says Glasser, who will soon be working with Austin Butler following his visit to her studio in north London alongside his model girlfriend Kaia Gerber.But whether she’s mixing a tailored fragrance for an exclusive venue, such as London’s Chiltern Firehouse, or an affluent individual — as she has done for Cindy Crawford (a 50th birthday present from her husband Rande Gerber), and David Linley, son of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones — Glasser approaches each scent as an entirely new landscape.“David called it a fun therapy session,” she laughs. “But it is learning about the person, or history, the character, style and so on,” said Glasser who called fragrance “the love of my life.”But it’s Hollywood’s A-listers who seem to benefit the most from a one-of-a-kind aroma.“As actors know, fragrance can transform you and take you on a journey. It opens up passages and doors in the brain, working through the olfactory system to bring out emotions,” noted Glasser. “It can make you feel more confident, powerful, desirable and assertive, and affect how others react to you. Essentially, scent tells a story.”"

        "title": "Jon Rahm takes a swing at world ranking rules after LIV Golf abandons ‘fight’ for points",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Former world No. 1 Jon Rahm criticized golf’s world ranking system on Wednesday, a day after LIV Golf formally withdrew its bid for the Spaniard and other players to accumulate points from playing its events.LIV Golf commissioner and CEO Greg Norman announced the decision in a letter sent to the tour’s membership, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. It ends a long-running pursuit by the Saudi-backed circuit to be recognized by the Official Golf World Rankings (OWGR), who unanimously rejected their request to join in October last year.“We have made enormous efforts to fight for you and to ensure your accomplishments are recognized within the existing ranking system,” Norman wrote in Tuesday’s letter.“Unfortunately, the OWGR has shown little willingness to productively work with us.”Following October’s rejection, OWGR chairman Peter Dawson said that “concerns” over LIV Golf’s 54-hole, no cut format meant that it would not be “fair and equitable” to the 24 eligible tours to allow players to accumulate points at its events.Though exact criteria differs between the major championships, all four of the men’s flagship tournaments incorporate world ranking points as a viable qualifier.The Masters, the first major of the season that tees off next month, offers automatic invites to any player who ranked inside the world’s top-50 in the previous calendar year or in the week prior to the tournament.Reigning Masters champion Rahm spent several weeks at world No. 1 after securing his second major title at Augusta National last year.After joining LIV Golf in December – he was then world No. 3 – the 29-year-old is currently the highest-placed of four players from the tour inside the top-50; Tyrell Hatton (17), Brooks Koepka (30) and Cameron Smith (50).Having called the OWGR “laughable” at the 2022 DP World Tour Championship, Rahm doubled down on his criticisms ahead of LIV Golf’s fourth event of the season in Hong Kong this week.“I didn’t think it was a good system back then, and if anything, the more time that goes on, the more it proves to be wrong,” he told reporters Wednesday.CNN has contacted the OWGR offering the organization the opportunity to comment.Rahm highlighted the recent performances of Joaquin Niemann, whose victory at LIV Golf-Jeddah in Saudi Arabia last week meant he has now won two of the tour’s first three events this year.Ranked 76th in the world, the Chilean had been competing on the DP World Tour – formerly the European Tour – to try and gain the ranking points needed to qualify for The Masters, only to see his goal unexpectedly realized courtesy of a special invitation to play the 88th edition of tournament last month.“If anybody in this world, for example, doesn’t think Joaco [Niemann] deserves to be in the top 10 or doesn’t know that he’s a top player in the world, I don’t know what game you’re watching,” said Rahm, who automatically qualifies for The Masters as a previous champion.“I think anybody who watches golf can tell who the best players in the world are, and obviously I don’t think the ranking is reflective of that right now to its entirety.“I’m very happy to see Joaco get invites,” Rahm added. “He’s shown the interest of wanting to qualify many different ways and has played the way you’re supposed to play, so I think it’s only right.”World No.4 Viktor Hovland said an inability for top players to gain points “devalues” the ranking system, as the Norwegian joined several PGA Tour stars in discussing the issue this week.“Rankings are rankings, they’re not objective truth,” the Norwegian told reporters ahead of the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida on Wednesday.“Obviously, now when you have a huge chunk of really, really good players that are not getting any ranking points, it definitely devalues that ranking.“At the end of the day, I don’t show up out here to try to improve my world ranking, I show up because I want to win this tournament and that’s it.”American duo Xander Schauffele and Will Zalatoris both welcomed Niemann’s invitation to The Masters.“I think that’s very well deserved,” Schauffele, world No.5, told reporters Tuesday.“I haven’t read too much of it, to be completely honest, but it seems that they’re not seeing sort of eye to eye on making an exemption to make LIV have World Ranking points. I’m not sure as to why they pulled their application for it, but it is what it is.”World No. 34 Zalatoris added: “You see what Joaquin’s done this year … the guy’s played some really good golf.“That’s kind of the utopian goal for all of us right now is to have the best players in the world play week in, week out. I love this week in general, because we got the best players on the PGA Tour, and we’ve got guys that obviously really care about it, but I also think we’ll see what happens going forward.“I don’t have the fix for it. I know some guys have voiced their opinions on it. I like staying out of that stuff. Right now, it’s in an interesting position, I’ll leave it at that.”"

        "title": "Two skyscrapers joined by daring cantilevered ‘skybridge’ to soar over New York",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "A pair of skyscrapers connected by a cantilevered “skybridge” and a rooftop infinity pool is set to join the New York City skyline, as developers unveiled a proposal for a new megaproject just south of the United Nations headquarters on Monday.Designed by architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), the 615-foot-tall towers will contain two hotels, while a soaring lobby across the top will house restaurants, bars, an art gallery a glass-floored (and glass-ceilinged) viewing platform and — should a license be granted — a subterranean casino.Along with two new residential towers, the skyscrapers will flank the newly unveiled Freedom Plaza development, a three-block-long public park with retail spaces and a new “Museum of Freedom and Democracy.”The Midtown Manhattan site, which overlooks the East River, is currently occupied by a large-scale art installation “Field of Light,” by British Artist Bruce Munro, that was commissioned by the charitable arm of Soloviev Group, the property developer behind the plan. But the 6.7-acre patch of prime real estate, roughly the size of Madison Square Park, has sat largely unused since the 2000s.Bjarke Ingels, the Danish founder and creative director of BIG, said his firm’s design looks to extend the greenery that architects Le Corbusier, Wallace Harrison and Oscar Niemeyer created at the neighboring UN building.“We continue to build on these architectural principles by uniting three city blocks to form a public green space reaching from 1st Avenue to the East River overlook, creating a green connection all the way to the water’s edge,” said Ingels in a press statement.The two hotel towers are set to host the city’s first five-star Banyan Tree property, as well as a hotel run by casino operator Mohegan. A 150,000-gallon infinity pool will be built on the roof of the connecting skybridge, with BIG describing it as “one of the largest rooftop pools in North America.”The 50- and 60-story residential towers, meanwhile, nod to the modernist New York City buildings of the 1950s and 1960s thanks to their striped glass and aluminum facades. Measuring 550 and 650 feet tall, the two high-rises will be connected by a podium housing a food market and retail space.The development is one of several projects competing for three casino gaming licenses recently approved for downstate New York by the state’s gaming commission. But plans have faced local opposition, with some residents and officials voicing concern about the development. Hoping to entice authorities to grant the license, the Soloviev Group has said it would designate 513, or nearly 40% of the development’s 1,325 apartments as affordable housing should the license come through.“The revenue generated by the project’s entertainment and hospitality component will allow Freedom Plaza to deliver the affordable housing program and expansive publicly accessible green space, with many more details yet to be announced,” said Ray Pineault, CEO and President of Mohegan in a statement last year.Americans are currently living through the toughest housing market in a generation, and New York has been one of the hardest hit locations, with rental vacancy rates down to a multi-decade low of 1.4%, according to the 2023 NYC Housing and Vacancy Survey.Soloviev Group has also promised that an unspecified percentage of the gaming profits, starting with a minimum $5 million donation, will go to an independently run non-profit community fund.Elsewhere on the site, BIG has designed a new “Museum of Freedom and Democracy” that “celebrates the origin and evolution of one of the most impactful inventions of mankind and our continuous struggle to build, maintain and protect the institutions that uphold it,” said Ingels.The Möbius strip-shaped building, overlooking the river, winds on top of itself creating outdoor walking paths. BIG described the design as an homage to the amphitheaters built by the Ancient Greeks, the creators of modern democracy.Unaffiliated with Long Island University’s Museum of Democracy, the new institution will contain pieces of the Berlin Wall and works from the Soloviev Group’s art collection.“Our plan is to develop this site in a way that delivers benefits for the local neighborhood and the city as a whole, worthy of its skyline and waterfront location, and befitting New York City’s key role as a leader in the global cultural economy,” said Michael Hershman, CEO of the Soloviev Group, in a press release.Groundbreaking and completion dates are yet to be announced as the developers await a decision on the project’s casino license but will likely be finished in five to seven years once building works commences.Should the license not be granted, the project will continue, likely based on a previous design approved in 2008, said the developer."

        "title": "Haiti’s prime minister lands in Puerto Rico, official says, as gangs rampage at home",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "A plane carrying Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry landed in Puerto Rico on Tuesday, its governor’s spokesperson told CNN, after days of speculation about his whereabouts as Haitian capital Port-au-Prince plunged into crisis over the weekend.Sheila Angleró Mojica told CNN she did not have additional details on the matter but added that “federal agents from the CBP [US Customs and Border Protection] are in charge,” without elaborating.Since last week, Port-au-Prince has been gripped by a wave of highly coordinated gang attacks on law enforcement and state institutions. Armed groups have burned down police stations and released thousands of inmates from two prisons, in what one gang leader described as an attempt to overthrow Henry’s government.The violence erupted while Henry was in Kenya, where he signed an agreement underpinning a Kenyan-led mission of 1,000 police officers to Haiti to restore security in the Caribbean country. The prime minister’s last appearance in public was in Kenya on Friday, before arriving today in Puerto Rico, per Mojica.Haiti’s government declared a state of emergency on Sunday amid the spiraling violence in Port-au-Prince. The United Nations has said 15,000 people have been forced to flee from their homes in the capital, adding to the over 300,000 who had already been displaced by gang violence.The government cited the “deterioration of security,” notably “increasingly violent criminal acts perpetrated by armed gangs,” including kidnappings and killings of citizens, violence against women and children and looting, according to a statement from Finance Minister Patrick Boivert.Port-au-Prince has been “handed to the gangs” who are continuing their assaults on police stations in the capital, Occil Francisco, a spokesperson for police union Synapoha told CNN Tuesday.At least eight police stations in Port-au-Prince “have been lost” in gang attacks, he said.The police academy, which holds more than 780 officers in training, was also under attack by men associated with gang leader Vitel’Homme Innocent, he said.The police union is urging officials to reinforce the “operational and reactive capacity” of the national police force so they can provide security for civilians, he said.“We can say that our leadership has failed, and the police do not have the means to right this situation in Port-au-Prince,” he said.CNN has reached out to the Haitian National Police for comment.The violence has prompted the Dominican Republic to suspend all cargo and passenger flights to and from neighboring Haiti.Dominican President Luis Abinader said Monday that a heightened level of security was in effect on his country’s border with Haiti and that any escaped Haitian prisoner who tried to enter the country would face “a drastic response.”Aid groups are scrambling to help residents of the capital. Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said it will scale up its activities in Port-au-Prince to care for the “mounting number” of injured people.“The violence has taken on a new dimension since last weekend, causing a massive number of casualties,” MSF said in a statement Tuesday.The aid group has however struggled to provide care to Haitians, as the country’s main port is now difficult to access and the international airport has been closed.“We fear we will run out of medicines and medical supplies, which are absolutely essential to meet the enormous needs we are facing at the moment,” Haiti MSF head Mumuza Muhindo Musubah said in a statement.Half of Haiti’s population, or about 5.5 million people, need humanitarian assistance, according to the UN.This story has been updated with additional developments."

        "title": "Pop star apologizes to fans after relationship reveal sparks backlash",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Are K-pop stars allowed to love?The answer is still a resounding “no” in some quarters – with K-pop singer Karina from the group Aespa posting a handwritten apology online after her reported relationship drew outcry from many of her more fervent followers.News of her relationship with actor Lee Jae-wook broke last week, confirmed by the agencies of both stars.The response from fans across Asia was swift, and mixed – some expressed their support for the couple. But many others reacted with shock and fury.Some outraged fans even sent a truck with an electronic billboard to the headquarters of Karina’s agency, according to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper, which published a photo of the sign. “Do you not get enough love from your fans?” it read. “Why did you choose to betray your fans?”“Please apologize directly. Otherwise, you’ll see declining album sales and empty concert seats,” it added.On Wednesday, Karina profusely apologized in a handwritten letter that she posted on Instagram, where she has 12.7 million followers.“I know very well how disappointed (my fans) who have supported me are and how upset you’re thinking about the memories we shared together,” she wrote. “I want to make up for my hurt fans from now on. I have always been sincere to you, and still each and every one of you are truly precious to me.”She expressed her “sincere apologies” to those who had supported her throughout her career, and vowed to “show more maturity and work harder going forward to all (my fans) without disappointment.”In many places around the world, the announcement that a young pop star and an actor have become an item would be little more than a quick celebrity headline.But in South Korea – and to some extent Japan – it can still be taboo in a culture where fans idolize their stars and record labels like to promote the fantasy of accessible, unhitched celebrities.Most K-pop stars live under strict rules, and it’s highly rare for them to date publicly, as labels worry that any relationships make stars lose their mystique among fans.And labels have reason to worry, with previous instances of angry fans turning on performers who publicize their relationships.In 2018, when artists Hyuna and E-Dawn began dating, their record label Cube Entertainment saw its stock drop several points. Both artists were suspended by Cube, under whom they had been performing together as part of the outfit Triple H.Experts have previously told CNN the phenomenon is partly due to the K-pop industry being built around fervid fanbases – with many going above and beyond to promote their favorite groups.Fans commonly make charitable donations in celebrities’ names to boost their public image, or pay for independent advertisements promoting tours or new albums.But this extreme loyalty also means artists and agencies are tightly tied to fan demands and desires – piling on pressure for K-pop stars under intense scrutiny.There have been signs of change in recent years, with agencies shifting away from controversial contract terms.While it’s still rare for agencies to announce the romantic relationships of K-pop idols, there have been more instances lately; notably, the agencies of Blackpink singer Jisoo and actor Ahn Bo-hyun confirmed last year that they were dating.Even fans have begun urging each other to allow stars more privacy and the ability to live their lives. Under Karina’s apology post on Wednesday, the comment section was flooded with fans rallying in support.“No idols (K-pop stars) should apologize for dating in 2024,” one top comment read. Another user wrote: “Apologize for loving someone? You don’t need to do this.”The news also made waves on Chinese social media. Aespa has a sizable Chinese fanbase, in part because one of the group’s members is Chinese. And while there were messages of support there, too, there were plenty of disgruntled fans who weren’t satisfied with Karina’s apology.“If she really cherished (her fans), she wouldn’t have fallen in love in the first place,” one user wrote on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo. “Her apology is far from sincere and merely just a tactic to save face. It just shows she is scared of losing fans and money. “Other fans pointed out that Karina’s apology hadn’t mentioned the status of her relationship – speculating that was simply confirmation they were still dating.“What the fans really want to hear from her is that she has broken up and maintains no contact with the guy,” one Weibo user wrote.Another declared: “How can she appear so burdenless and carefree after all of this? Happily in love while hanging fans out to dry, as if nothing happened. She can’t have it both ways.”"

        "title": "Pro-Palestinian firebrand politician wins UK byelection in blow to main opposition Labour Party",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Britain’s opposition Labour Party, widely expected to win a general election due to be held within months, has lost one of its safest parliamentary seats to a pro-Palestinian former party member in a chaotic by-election.Veteran left-winger George Galloway was elected to represent the constituency of Rochdale by a majority of nearly 6,000 votes, pledging to be a thorn in the side for Labour over the Gaza war.The by-election, a special election held outside of the general election cycle, had attracted particular attention because Labour was forced to withdraw support from its candidate, Azhar Ali, after videos emerged of him claiming that Israel was complicit in the October 7 Hamas attacks.The comments turned the campaign, sparked by the death of the local MP, on its head. Labour initially stood by Ali, only to withdraw their support but too close to the by-election to put forward another candidate.This created an opportunity for Galloway, who has a long history of campaigning in areas that have a large Muslim population and appealing, critics say distastefully, for their votes.In the days running up to the byelection, the political editor of the Sun, a popular British tabloid, discovered campaign material from Galloway that had been sent specifically to Muslim voters, saying: “The political class has failed Rochdale, failed Britain and failed Gaza … the Labour Party under Keir Starmer have betrayed Muslims, choosing instead to support Israel’s genocide in Gaza … I, George Galloway, have fought for Muslims at home and abroad all of my life. And paid a price for it.”The Labour Party has been walking a difficult tightrope since the start of the Israel-Hamas war of calling for a pause in violence without wanting to criticize Israel. The issue of Israel is particularly sensitive, because Labour was until very recently embroiled in an anti-Semitism scandal under previous leader Jeremy Corbyn.CNN tried to contact Galloway’s office to confirm if the campaign material was theirs but received no reply.Galloway was expelled from the Labour Party in 2003 after he opposed then Prime Minister and Labour leader Tony Blair’s support for the war in Iraq.He made a memorable and defiant appearance at a US Senate panel to answer accusations he had profited from Iraqi oil sales, accusing the panel’s Republican chairman of making a “schoolboy howler.”While Galloway can claim to have always been a supporter of Muslim causes and Palestinians, he has been accused of using anti-Semitic tropes. He was sacked by the radio station TalkSport after he tweeted: “No #Israël flags on the Cup!” after English soccer team Tottenham Hotspur, who have strong links to the North London Jewish community, were defeated in the Champion’s League final in 2019. Galloway has previously denied allegations of anti-Semitism.He has also worked for state-funded media, RT and Press TV, owned by Russia and Iran respectively. Both channels have had their broadcast licences banned in the UK and been accused of peddling propaganda.Galloway’s victory is noteworthy for the context in which it took place, but doesn’t necessarily tell us much about the general election that will take place at some point this year. Had Labour not had to abandon its candidate, it is likely the seat would have held.It does send a warning, however, to Starmer and the Labour Party about the need to properly screen candidates, as it could be badly hurt by similar stories emerging in the run up to the general election."

        "title": "Anthony Joshua vs. Francis Ngannou: former world champion faces MMA star with future title fight potentially on the line",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "The worlds of boxing and mixed martial arts have become entwined in recent years, with the stars of both sports meeting in the boxing ring to display their various talents.Francis Ngannou is arguably the fighter who has taken the swap of disciplines most seriously, clashing with world heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury last year in his boxing debut and more than holding his own in a controversial defeat.And the former UFC heavyweight title holder will once again step into the ring to take on another British former world heavyweight champion, this time in the shape of Anthony Joshua.With a possible future title fight on the line – reports have suggested the winner could face the victor of the highly-anticipated Fury-Oleksandr Usyk unification fight – there’s a lot riding on Joshua and Ngannou’s clash.Here’s everything you need to know.Ngannou and Joshua will exchange blows on Friday, March 8 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the location of Ngannou’s previous fight against Fury.They will take part in a 10-round clash, with their ring walks expected at around 6 p.m.E.T. / 11 p.m. UK time.Fans in the US and around the world can watch the event on DAZN pay-per-view, while Sky Sports will show the event in the UK.Ngannou’s switch to boxing perhaps shouldn’t have come as a surprise given he began his fighting career in the ring.Even before that, Ngannou underwent a remarkable journey – leaving Cameroon with just a backpack and traveling north through Africa to reach Europe – just to train as a fighter.Ngannou battled crossing the Mediterranean by sea and was even detained in Spain for two months in a migrant center for illegally entering the country, according to the Guardian, before eventually reaching Paris where he found a gym to train. He remembers what he asked the owner at that time.“I have no money, I have nothing, but I want to be a world champion.”However, the French-Cameroonian later moved to the octagon and went on to have huge success with the UFC.He won the UFC heavyweight title in 2021, taking off of Stipe Miocic and later defended it against Frenchman Ciryl Gane.Although Ngannou later left the UFC over a contract dispute and moved to the Professional Fighters League, he has yet to compete in the PFL and instead focused on his boxing career.His debut fight against Fury came with a lot of fanfare, and Ngannou lived up to it as he traded blows with one of the greats of the sport, knocking down the British fighter in the third round of their clash. Despite losing on points, many scored the fight in Ngannou’s favor.Ngannou has said that he thought that he won the fight with Fury and called himself the “underground king” of boxing.Joshua himself was also impressed by Ngannou’s display. “I was watching the Fury and Ngannou fight from home, and from what I saw, I thought he won,” Joshua told Sky Sports.“It’s not a gimmick, it’s not something that’s benefiting the broadcasters, it’s not just a fight for entertainment purposes,” added Joshua.“This is a serious fight with someone who is prepared and understands the dynamic of boxing and he’s putting up a good fight against the apparently generational great. So I look at it now as something completely different.”And ahead of his second professional boxing fight, Ngannou is confident of victory against Joshua, also questioning his opponent’s ability to withstand his power.“I heard that he doesn’t have a chin,” Ngannou said, per Reuters.“I don’t know if it’s true or not. We’re going to find out. I hope I have the opportunity to test that out, that’s my wish.”For Joshua, the fight is the next stage on his road to redemption.Having burst onto the boxing scene with a 22-fight unbeaten streak, a defeat to Andy Ruiz Jr. and two to Usyk have dented his reputation as a serious title contender.The 34-year-old has achieved a three-fight win streak to put himself back in contention, but he still hasn’t yet returned to his previously untouchable status.While some suggested Fury didn’t take Ngannou seriously enough before their fight, Joshuya is making no such assumptions.“I don’t put that pressure on myself and I don’t have that thought about anything.I just think about winning and doing what I need to do, that’s my mentality,” Joshua said.“It’s a fight, it’s a 50/50 fight. Anything can happen. Crazier things have happened before. It is what it is. It’s a great opportunity for me to go back to work. If I didn’t take this opportunity that’s presented to me, when would I be fighting next?“When you look at it, I’m not at the start of my career, I’m not at the middle of my career, I’d say I’m probably towards the end of my career.“Call it whatever you want to call it, I’m just happy to be at work and doing my job and I can’t wait for the next opportunity that presents itself.”A clash between the two British heavyweight boxing stars – Joshua and Fury – has been tipped for years now, but has never taken place.If Joshua was to win against Ngannou, promoter Eddie Hearn isn’t ruling out the long-clamored bout finally taking place.“The dream for Joshua has always been to be undisputed,” Hearn told the BBC. “If AJ beats Ngannou and Fury beats Usyk, the whole world will be calling for Fury vs. Joshua.“It’s probably one of the biggest fights in the history of the sport. Certainly the biggest fight in boxing now.”"

        "category": "world",
        "text": "A flight in China was delayed by more than four hours on Wednesday after a passenger threw coins into the engine, according to Chinese state media.China Southern Airlines flight CZ8805 was originally scheduled to take off from the southern city of Sanya to Beijing around 10 a.m. local time on March 6, but it did not depart until around 2:16 p.m. local time, flight-tracking websites Flightradar24 and Flight Aware showed.In a video shared by multiple state media outlets, a flight attendant is seen questioning a passenger believed to have thrown the coins, asking them how many coins were thrown into the engine. The passenger, whose identity was not revealed in the video or by state media, can be heard on camera saying “three to five” coins.The passenger who allegedly threw the coins was later taken away by airport police, state media reported, citing Chinese Southern Airlines.The airline said coins were found during security checks, but did not specify how many were located.“The aircraft maintenance staff conducted a comprehensive safety inspection and determined that there were no safety issues before takeoff,” the airline’s customer service told state media.China Southern Airlines issued a warning against “uncivilized behaviors” on their official Chinese social media Weibo account on Wednesday, saying “throwing coins at the plane pose a threat to aviation safety and will result in different levels of punishment.” However, the post did not reference the incident directly.CNN has reached out to China Southern Airlines.Similar incidents of people throwing coins at planes, apparently for “good luck,” have occurred in recent years in China.Last October, a China Southern Airlines flight was delayed in Guangzhou after a passenger was observed throwing coins towards the plane. In 2021, a GX Airlines flight between Weifang and Haikou was canceled when several coins wrapped in red paper were discovered on the ground. And in 2017, an elderly passenger threw coins at a China Southern Airlines plane during boarding at Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport, claiming it was “a prayer for a safe flight.”"

        "title": "Golf legend Annika Sorenstam achieved almost every major accolade in her sport. But it’s what comes after that means the most",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "It’s a crisp and sunny Sunday afternoon in Orlando, Florida – a perfect day to play a round on the more than 1,000 golf courses scattered across the Sunshine State. But Annika Sorenstam, arguably the greatest female golfer of all time, is instead playing a lighthearted putting game with her husband and two children in their Lake Nona backyard.From Sorenstam’s historic 59 – the lowest-scoring game ever during a women’s competition – to her 90 international wins, her professional legacy is unmatched. Today, she’s working just as hard to give back to the sport that has given her so much.Since retiring in 2008, the former pro has been prioritizing family, and her foundation – which focuses on supporting young women in golf. Much like the theme of this year’s International Women’s Day, Sorenstam believes investing in women will ensure their success, not just with golf, but with life.“There’s no doubt that the girls that come through the foundation, they are great golfers, but many of them don’t go on to necessarily play professional golf, which is not really the purpose of the foundation,” Sorenstam recently told CNN during an interview at her Florida home. “It’s more to inspire them to fulfill their dreams. There’s a lot of opportunities for women in this sport.”Before she was the golf “GOAT,” Sorenstam was just a young girl from the small town of Bro, Sweden, who played a lot of different sports, but was not exactly drawn to golf.“Golf was really not something that was super exciting to me in the beginning,” she said. “I wanted a little bit more action, a little more speed.”But living so close to a golf course, and being bribed to play by her parents offering ice cream to her and her sister Charlotta, she says she eventually started to enjoy the game and how it challenged her.At 18, she won the World Amateur Championship and that’s when she realized she could pursue a career in the sport. She says she was also inspired by other women in golf at the time, like Nancy Lopez and Beth Daniel, adding how important it was to see that representation. When Liselotte Neumann, a Swede as well, won the US Open in 1988, Sorenstam said, “I was like, ‘wow, she has a similar background like I do, and so if she can do it, maybe there’s a chance I can do it.’”Cognizant of the disparities between men’s golf earnings and visibility compared to women’s when she went pro, Sorenstam said she was just so excited to get the chance to play that she didn’t think much about the gap. “I knew that women’s golf is going to grow and hopefully we will get there one day,” she said.Little did the Swede know at the time that she would help usher in a new era of women’s golf – elevating the sport like never before.Over her professional career, Sorenstam amassed 11 major championships, including 72 on the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) tour. She also holds a record number of Rolex Player of the Year awards and Vare Trophies for the lowest scoring average during a season.To date, she is the only female in history to break 60 in an official competition, which was a pivotal moment in her career in 2001.“To be the first woman to do something, it gives you in this case credibility and a nice little nickname: ‘Miss 59,’” Sorenstam said, adding it’s about being able to “set the bar high … just keep working and you can break barriers.”This accomplishment opened the door for her to play against the men at the 2003 Colonial, where she became the first female in over 50 years to play in a PGA event.“I remember just being super excited. I remember just like, wow, I’m gonna push even harder,” she said. “I wanted to showcase that we can play, and it was a great experience.”In 2008, at the age of 38, Sorenstam made the decision to walk away from competitive golf – but she’s never strayed far out of bounds. She began designing golf courses and golf clothing, while also setting up the ANNIKA Foundation, which aims to foster the next generation of women and girls in golf through clinics, tournaments, mentorship and financial support.According to the National Golf Foundation, 38% of golfers under the age of 18 in the US are girls. When her foundation began, Sorenstam says that number was less than 20%.“I really enjoy spending time with these young girls because I know what it’s like to be 14, 15 (years old), and having all these questions and dreams but don’t really know where to go,” she said. “To be able to get that guidance we feel is really important.”Annually, over 600 girls from 60 countries participate in the ANNIKA Foundation initiatives – ranging from major golf events to development programs, Sorenstam says, in addition to giving almost $9 million back to girls’ golf every year.And she does all this alongside her husband, Mike McGee, who helps garner support from corporate sponsors.“She gives back more than anybody I’ve ever seen,” he told CNN. “I’m blessed to get to work with Annika, she’s my boss literally and figuratively.”McGee also helped secure Sorenstam’s name on her first namesake LPGA tournament in Tampa – THE ANNIKA driven by Gainbridge at Pelican.Mollie Marcoux Samaan, commissioner of the LPGA, told CNN, “to have her name on that tournament is critical for the sport,” she said, adding that Sorenstam “is the LPGA in so many ways and we couldn’t be more grateful for the platform that she uses to inspire girls and women on and off the golf course.”In the tournament’s first year, Louise Rydqvist, a Swedish amateur and US collegiate golfer who rose through Sorenstam’s foundation, had the opportunity to play – a “full circle” moment, Sorenstam said.“(To) be able to fulfill her dream and then play in an LPGA event,” she added, “it feels obviously wonderful to be able to provide another playing opportunity, not just for the pros, but also for some of these upcoming players.”Katherine Muzi, a nascent professional golfer, was one of the first to partake in Sorenstam’s development program held at Old Barnwell in Aiken, South Carolina. There she received access for three years to the golf course, housing, financial assistance, training and mentorship from Sorenstam herself.“(The program) really just opened the door,” Muzi told CNN at the ANNIKA Foundation’s first fundraiser of the year this February. “Just to be involved with anything with Annika, she’s really inspired me and so many girls playing golf. And I feel better just by being around her – she has that much of an impact.”Held at the Country Club of Orlando, the event kicked off with the American Junior Golf Association’s (AJGA) presenting Sorenstam with the Digger Smith Award, which is given annually to a recipient devoted to the AJGA’s mission of developing young men and women through competitive junior golf.But Sorenstam was quick to call McGee up to receive it with her. “It’s all team effort from start to finish,” she said.Winning games and trophies are great, she added, but “to win a person’s heart, to win somebody’s inspiration, that weighs pretty heavy.”Her influence is felt far beyond the course, as Ryleigh Knaub, a junior golfer, pointed out in an emotional tribute to the golf legend at the event: “Players like myself have seen you become a mother, a wife, a role model, an ambassador and a champion for girls all around the world just like me. You’ve shown it’s possible to seemingly have it all.”"

        "title": "Grenada charges prison escapees with murder of American couple missing since alleged yacht hijacking",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Three inmates who escaped from prison in Grenada have been charged with killing two Americans after allegedly hijacking their yacht last month to flee to St. Vincent and the Grenadines, police said Thursday.The Royal Granada Police Force said in a statement that Ron Mitchell, Atiba Stanisclaus and Trevon Robertson were each charged with two counts of capital murder over the presumed deaths of Americans Ralph Hendry and Kathleen Brandel.The three suspects have also been charged with escaping lawful custody, housebreaking, robbery and kidnapping. Stanislaus was separately charged with one count of rape.The latest police update did not make clear who Stanislaus is accused of raping and did not provide information on whether the bodies of the couple had been recovered.Hendry and Brandel, based in Virginia, were living out a long-held dream of cruising the Caribbean in their sailing yacht called Simplicity, to Antigua when they went missing, according to their yacht club, the Salty Dawg Sailing Association.Their vessel was found abandoned in neighboring St. Vincent and the Grenadines on February 21, with the husband and wife nowhere to be found, the yacht club said.Authorities in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines launched joint investigations to track down the suspects who allegedly left behind a violent scene on the missing couple’s yacht, including blood stains.Last week, Grenada police commissioner Don McKenzie said in a news conference the couple was likely thrown overboard during the hijacking, and information suggests the escapees “disposed of the occupants” while traveling between Grenada and St. Vincent, about 80 miles away.Their alleged killers committed “several criminal acts including bodily harm to the couple” while sailing, the Royal St. Vincent and the Grenadines Police Force said last week. When authorities eventually recovered the yacht, the scene was “consistent with signs of violence,” the police force said.All three suspects made their first court appearance in St. George’s Magistrate’s Court in Grenada on Thursday and were remanded to prison. They are due back in court on March 27.CNN has reached out to the police for more information.The couple’s disappearance has left family and loved ones reeling.Hendry’s son, Bryan Hendry, and Brandel’s son, Nick Buro, released a joint statement last month, remembering their parents for living with love, faith and sailing.“Ralph and Kathy lived a life that most of us can only dream of, sailing the eastern coast of the United States, living on their home Simplicity, making friends with everyone they encountered, singing, dancing and laughing with friends and family – that’s who Ralph and Kathy were and that’s how they will be remembered in our hearts,” the statement read.“If we have learned anything from this tragic event, it’s that we know they left this world in a better place than it was before they were born.”Buro and Bryan Hendry called their parents the strongest people they will ever know, saying they “strive to be even half as wonderful as them.”“While the end of their life may have been dark, they brought light, and that light will never be extinguished from the hearts and minds of the people who knew, loved and cared so deeply about them,” the statement read.Buro said his mother and stepfather were veteran boaters who had been planning the trip – their first cruise of the Caribbean – for years.“They were super careful to be safe all the time,” Buro said. “Everywhere they went everything they did, safety was their top, top concern. So this unfortunate accident, I think, it came out of nowhere for them.”The couple sold their home and bought Simplicity years ago, throwing themselves into an enthralling life on the water, he said.“It was their home. Everything they had, they owned, was on that boat. It was their life,” he said. “Kathy worked her whole life and then retired. Ralph worked in financial services and continued to work from the boat. But really what they did was … choose a lifestyle that most of us would never imagine could be done. And they loved every minute of it and they saw many parts of the world and just lived a life of joy and love.”"

        "title": "Freddie Mercury’s London home for sale for $38 million",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "The former London home of rock legend Freddie Mercury is available to buy – that is, for those with a cool £30 million ($38 million) to spare.Garden Lodge in Kensington, west London, was home to the Queen front man for 11 years, and boasts features including a Japanese sitting room, a double height drawing room, a bar/library and a music center.The property was bought by Mercury on the spot when he first visited it in 1980, according to Knight Frank, which is handling the sale.Collaborating with specialist interior architect and designer Robin Moore Ede, Mercury renovated the home over the next decade, using the finest materials and his personal design taste to create what he called his “country house in central London,” Knight Frank said in a press release Monday.The Queen singer designed his home to be a “memorable, inviting place that reflected his vibrant personality and eclectic vision,” the release added.In this spirit, the dining room was painted citrus-yellow, reportedly Mercury’s favorite color, with complementary jewel tones in the cornices of the room.Once home to the grand piano that Mercury used to compose “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the drawing room offers views of the property’s garden, which is adorned with large magnolia trees and “oriental inspired” water features.The property’s principal suite is entered through what used to be Mercury’s dressing room, where he stored his clothes and stage costumes. The room is mirrored from floor to ceiling, with multiple cupboard doors.Upon his death in 1991, Mercury bequeathed the property and all of its possessions to his close friend and confidante, Mary Austin.After more than 30 years taking care of them, Austin, now 72, auctioned about 1,400 of Mercury’s belongings last year, and is now looking to sell Garden Lodge for offers in excess of £30 million ($38 million), according to Knight Frank.“This house has been the most glorious memory box, because it has such love and warmth in every room,” Austin said in the press release.“It has been a joy to live in and I have many wonderful memories here. Now that it is empty, I’m transported back to the first time we viewed it.“Ever since Freddie and I stepped through the fabled green door, it has been a place of peace, a true artist’s house, and now is the time to entrust that sense of peace to the next person,” she added."

        "title": "World’s largest hunger crisis looms in Sudan, UN warns, as humanitarian response hits ‘breaking point’",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "The war in Sudan is “triggering the world’s largest hunger crisis,” with more than 25 million people “trapped in a spiral” of food insecurity, a United Nations agency has warned.Nine in 10 people across the country face “emergency levels of hunger” and are “stuck” in areas “largely inaccessible” due to “relentless violence and interference by the warring parties,” the UN’s World Food Program (WFP) said Wednesday.The war, which has also created the world’s largest displacement crisis, according to the UN, has left 18 million people “acutely food insecure” in Sudan and millions more in neighboring South Sudan and Chad.“Twenty years ago, Darfur was the world’s largest hunger crisis, and the world rallied to respond. But today, the people of Sudan have been forgotten. Millions of lives and the peace and stability of an entire region are at stake,” said Cindy McCain, Executive Director of the WFP.Thousands of people have been killed and eight million displaced since fighting broke out in April between forces loyal to two rival generals – army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who leads Sudan’s Armed Forces (SAF), and the head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo.Both forces and their allied militias have been accused of killing civilians, ransacking houses and ethnic cleansing, leading to accusations of crimes against humanity and fueling the exodus from the East African country.The WFP said it was now “struggling to keep pace with the significant level of need” and described the humanitarian response in the two neighboring states as “at breaking point.”The crisis has deepened since the program was forced to halt its operations transporting aid from Chad to Sudan’s western Darfur region after local authorities revoked permission for cross-border truck convoys, according to the WFP. Since August, more than one million people had received WFP aid via the route.One in five children at transit centers at the main border crossing between Sudan and South Sudan are malnourished, according to the WFP“Newly arrived displaced people in South Sudan make up 35 percent of those facing catastrophic levels of hunger – the highest possible level – despite accounting for less than 3 percent of the population,” the WFP added.The warning from the WFP came as US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the UN had found evidence that girls as young as 14 had been raped by “elements” of the Rapid Support Forces in WFP storage facilities controlled by the paramilitary faction.Thomas-Greenfield on Wednesday read out sections from the UN Panel of Experts’ final report on Sudan, a report she described as “52 pages of stomach-churning findings.”She said the report claimed that RSF snipers “indiscriminately targeted civilians, including women, pregnant women and young people,” and “schools, hospitals, markets, government buildings and humanitarian assets were looted mostly by RSF and allied militias and destroyed by shelling and bombing by the two warring parties.”The UN has previously said that a spike in gender-based violence since fighting broke out amounts to crimes against humanity. In July, the UN said that as many as 4.2 million women and girls were at increased risk of sexual violence, while a CNN investigation has detailed widespread cases of sexual assault alleged by Sudanese activists, particularly in the Darfur region, where entire communities have reportedly been ravaged by targeted ethnic-based killings.Thomas-Greenfield said the latest report included “gruesome photos” taken in West Darfur “where the RSF has targeted members of the Masalit community.”“This is just a snapshot of the death, destruction, depravity that has defined this conflict. A conflict that, as this report details, is being fueled by arms transfers from a handful of regional powers. Armed transfers that must stop,” she said, remarking that the international community “is not doing nearly enough” to address the crisis.“It is my hope that this sobering report will, at long last, shake the world from its indifference to the horrors playing out before our eyes,” she added."

        "title": "Why the royals have become the center of conspiracy theories",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "The decision of Prince William to pull out of an important family gathering on Tuesday, and the absence of an explanation, has engulfed the British royal family in a tidal wave of gossip, speculation and wild conspiracy theories.Some of that is par for the course, for a family that has never been far from the headlines in the modern media age. But the discourse reached a frenzied level this week – particularly in the unchecked realms of social media.As the event - a memorial service for William’s late godfather, former King Constantine II of Greece - was getting underway at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor on Tuesday, royal insiders revealed the Prince of Wales would miss it due to a personal matter. William, a source told CNN, had called the Greek royal family to let them know of his last-minute change of plans.Skipping events doesn’t normally spark the sort of theorizing that has ensued. Go back two years and there simply wouldn’t have been the same level of online speculation that has been witnessed in recent days.But many have been left unsettled by the seemingly never-ending run of recent royal heartache and health scares. The death of Queen Elizabeth II, and both King Charles III and Catherine, Princess of Wales getting ill soon after, plus the fact that the public haven’t seen Kate since Christmas Day, have all contributed to the speculation.The series of devastating blows was further compounded with the sudden death of Thomas Kingston, the husband of the King’s cousin Lady Gabriella, at the age of 45. It is understood that William’s non-attendance was not tied to the news of Kingston’s death, which was revealed publicly on the same day as Constantine’s memorial.The royal source wouldn’t be drawn on exactly what had prevented William from going to the service. With that lack of clarity, people have linked his absence with that of his wife, Kate, who is still at home recuperating from surgery. Many saw the prince’s recent return to royal duties as a signal that the prognosis in the Wales household was improving quickly.Others have suggested it should have been easy for the heir to the throne to join his wider family at Windsor Castle as he only lives a roughly five-minute drive away at Adelaide Cottage and as his three children were at school when the event was taking place.If the role of monarchy is presence, continuity and unity, it was a stark visual seeing the royal family enter the chapel without several key senior faces among them.It’s worth emphasizing that the royal source told CNN that Kate “continues to be doing well” in her recovery. And even though the palace was clear from the outset that the Princess of Wales’ recuperation would take her away from public duties for several months after her abdominal operation, people are still trying to fill in the gaps.Kensington Palace made a rare move in the face of the speculation on Kate’s whereabouts and health, with a spokesperson saying on Thursday that the palace “made it clear in January the timelines of the Princess’ recovery and we’d only be providing significant updates. That guidance stands.”While William wasn’t present at the memorial service on Tuesday, his diary hasn’t been cleared of public events and he was back in action on Thursday.The palace has been trying to give out as much information as it can without compromising medical privacy. This is the challenge of an age-old monarchy operating in a transformed landscape, where people expect information immediately. It’s not always that the public is being insensitive, but rather that people care and want to know why someone they are used to seeing has disappeared from public view.As a society, we’re accustomed to having information at our fingertips and there is an instinctive desire to fill the void. An example of plugging holes in gaps of knowledge is best represented in Netflix’s “The Crown.” It was initially based on historical record but as seasons moved closer to the present day, writers and producers were forced to dramatize moments for storytelling purposes.The reality is that no one - beyond those immediately involved - knows exactly why William pulled out of this family event or how Kate is feeling day-to-day. The latest developments have emphasized that, while the Waleses are public servants, they are also people vulnerable to the same struggles we all face."

        "title": "Waterlogged pitch causes controversy as US women’s team beats Canada in penalty shootout to reach W Gold Cup final",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Wet conditions were the main talking point during the US women’s soccer team’s penalty shootout victory over Canada in the W Gold Cup semifinals on Wednesday.The game was played on a heavily waterlogged pitch at Snapdragon Stadium in San Diego after torrential rain fell in the build up, with huge sections of standing water affecting the path of the ball and players’ ability to run at pace with it at their feet.Following the snowy conditions Real Salt Lake and LAFC played in over the weekend, the wet field in San Diego was once again a point of controversy.The tricky conditions were highlighted in the 11th minute when US forward Trinity Rodman raced through on goal with only the keeper to beat, only for the ball to stop in the water and halt any goalscoring opportunity.Just minutes later, the US was a beneficiary of the conditions, when Canada defender Vanessa Gilles’ pass to goalkeeper Kaelin Sheridan stopped dramatically in the puddles, allowing Jaedyn Shaw to give the US the lead.Throughout the encounter, players consistently struggled to come to terms with the conditions, with the ball holding up in the water and making it almost impossible to sustain any sense of flow to the game.Former US midfielder Julie Foudy heavily criticized the decision for the game to go ahead on social media, calling it “insane.”“Why isn’t CONCACAF calling this match. Play it (tomorrow). Someone is going to get hurt,” the two-time World Cup winner said on X – formerly known as Twitter – also using the hashtag ‘waterparkgame.’After the game, Canada coach Bev Priestman echoed Foudy’s thoughts.“It’s obvious that the game was unplayable,” Priestman said, per ESPN. “We put in a lot of work in a game plan, and within minute one, it’s thrown out the window.”Priestman added: “I’m not going to make excuses as to was it fair, was it unfair. We played the game in front of us, both teams had to play on the conditions and it was who could adapt the most.”In a statement to CNN, a Concacaf spokesperson said that it is “solely at the discretion of the referee as to whether the field is safe and playable.”There was no shortage of action though in the game, with the teams level 2-2 after extra-time before the US won 3-1 on penalties.Shaw opened the scoring, taking advantage of the watery conditions to slot home, becoming the first US women’s player ever to score in each of her first four starts. Jordyn Huitema leveled for Canada eight minutes from full-time to send the match to extra-time.Sophia Smith gave the US its second lead of the game in extra-time, only for Adriana Leon to level once again, this time from the penalty spot, three minutes from the end to send the game to a shootout.US goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher proved to be the difference maker, saving three Canadian penalties and scoring her own to send her side into the final of the W Gold Cup where it will face Brazil, after the Seleção had beaten Mexico 3-0 in its semifinal.The final will take place in Snapdragon Stadium on Sunday at 8:15 p.m. ET."

        "title": "North Korea showcases artillery that poses a deadly threat to the South",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "North Korea on Thursday showed off its long-range artillery systems, thousands of weapons that it could use to strike the South with little warning while causing tens of thousands of casualties, according to experts.The North’s artillery drills come at a time of heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula as the United States and South Korea conduct their annual Freedom Shield exercise, which the South Korean military said will focus on deterring North Korea’s nuclear threats.North Korea’s Defense Ministry on Monday denounced the 11-day US-South Korea joint exercises as “provocative” and “reckless,” and warned North Korean forces will monitor “adventurist acts” and conduct “responsible military activities” to bring what it called an unstable security situation under control, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).Thursday’s artillery exercise was the North’s second drill this week, a day after its ground forces appeared to infiltrate border guard posts during maneuvers.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un observed both drills and was seen in photos provided by state media.A KCNA report on Friday said the artillery drill sent a message to the South.“The drill started with the power demonstration firing of the long-range artillery sub-units near the border who have put the enemy’s capital in their striking range and fulfilled important military missions for war deterrence,” the KCNA report said.Kim stressed the importance of preparing “for regular combat mobilization so that all the artillery sub-units can take the initiative with merciless and rapid strikes at the moment of their entry into an actual war,” the report said.North Korea’s artillery systems have been making headlines in recent weeks as Pyongyang is arming Russian forces with them for combat in Ukraine.Since August, Pyongyang has shipped about 6,700 containers to Russia, which could accommodate more than 3 million rounds of artillery shells or more than 500,000 rounds for multiple rocket launchers, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.While those weapons present a big challenge for Ukraine’s defenders, they are also an ever-present looming threat for South Korea and the US military forces stationed on the Korean Peninsula.Artillery strikes are almost impossible to defend against, experts say.A 2020 report from the RAND Corp. think tank said North Korea’s artillery systems, with nearly 6,000 big guns within range of major South Korean population centers, present as great a danger to the South as Kim’s nuclear weapons and missile programs.“If fired at civilian targets, those nearly 6,000 systems could potentially kill more than 10,000 people in only an hour,” the RAND report said.In one scenario, a one-minute barrage on a 2.4-square-kilometer area of the capital Seoul using just 54 multiple rocket launchers, predicted more than 10,000 casualties.“Because (North Korean) shelling could kill many thousands in just an hour, with little warning, it would be difficult for the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the United States, once the bombardment had begun, to halt it, or otherwise protect the ROK population, before it could do very serious harm,” the report said.Even retaliatory strikes by South Korea and the US would be difficult to execute, the report said.“Much of the DPRK’s artillery is located in heavily fortified hardened artillery sites (HARTS) with air defense capabilities deployed to their rear. These physical protective measures make air strikes and counter-battery fire against the DPRK artillery a challenge for U.S. and ROK forces,” the report said.Kim has drawn an increasingly harder line against South Korea in recent months, saying the North will no longer seek reconciliation and reunification with the South and instructing the country’s army, munitions industry, nuclear weapons and civil defense sectors to accelerate war preparations in response to “confrontation moves” by the US.In January, Kim called the South the North’s “primary foe and invariable principal enemy” and ordered a reunification monument in the North Korean capital to be demolished."

        "title": "What it’s like on board an outnumbered Philippine ship facing down China’s push to dominate the South China Sea",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "As dawn slowly broke on the horizon, a large fleet of Chinese vessels came into view from the deck of a Philippine Coast Guard ship as it entered the contested waters of the South China Sea.Significantly outnumbered by the number of Chinese vessels, the four ships in the Philippine convoy on a resupply mission to troops were quickly surrounded and separated during a frantic high seas skirmish on Tuesday morning.Within just a few hours, the window of one Philippine boat would be shattered by water cannon and four sailors aboard would be injured.China’s determination to assert its disputed sovereignty over the entirety of the vast South China Sea has sparked increasing clashes with its neighbors in recent years, particularly the Philippines, which is a mutual defense ally of the United States.But what CNN journalists on board the Philippine Coast Guard vessel on Tuesday witnessed was one of the most severe confrontations to date — and a vivid illustration of how this David versus Goliath struggle in one of the world’s busiest shipping waterways could spiral into the next global conflict.The Philippine ship tried to find safe passage through myriad China Coast Guard ships as well as fishing vessels that form part of China’s shadowy “maritime militia” blocking their path.The Philippines accused the China Coast Guard ships of colliding with two of their vessels, causing damage to their exteriors. One of the smaller Philippine boats was also hit by water cannons from two Chinese vessels, shattering the windshield and leaving the crew on board with injuries.China countered that its coast guard vessels “took control measures” against Philippine ships that it claimed “illegally intruded” into its sovereign territory. It said the damaged Philippine ship ignored repeated warnings and “deliberately rammed” into a China Coast Guard vessel in what it said was an “unprofessional and dangerous manner.”CNN joined the Philippine Coast Guard for two days, the first time foreign journalists have been allowed to embed with the fleet in decades.Their mission was to resupply a small group of marines living on a World War II-era ship grounded on an obscure contested reef.Missions like this have become one of the most regular causes of direct confrontations between the Philippines and its giant neighbor China, which has built up the world’s largest navy. What happens among the tiny islands, reefs and atolls of this corner of the globe could have profound international repercussions and become a major global flashpoint.Departing the sleepy port of Bulilyan on the southern tip of the Philippines’ Palawan Island, two Philippine Coast Guard ships embarked on a 13-hour overnight journey north to the Sabina Shoal, where they met up with two smaller resupply vessels staffed by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, transporting food, water and other essentials.The coast guard ships then tried to escort the smaller vessels as they navigated the disputed waters on a four-hour steam toward the next location.Their target was the Sierra Madre, a rusted ship that rests on a strategically vital shoal that has become the epicenter of this simmering confrontation.The US-built Philippine Navy landing craft was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board. Since then, rotating detachments of Filipino marines have been living on board, hunkering down through tropical heat, typhoons and long spells away from home in a bid to assert territorial rights and prevent any Chinese development there.The vessel rests atop a contested reef, which even has a name that is under dispute. Though internationally known as the Second Thomas Shoal, the Philippines call the reef Ayungin Shoal, and China refers to it as Ren’ai Jiao.The teardrop-shaped reef forms part of the contested Spratly islands – which are all claimed by China. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made territorial claims to some of the shoals.During the confrontation, Filipino crews counted a total of five China Coast Guard vessels, 18 boats belonging to Beijing’s “maritime militia” – and at a further distance, two Chinese naval vessels and a military helicopter, said Coast Guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela on Wednesday.“The Philippines is solely responsible for this,” China’s Coast Guard said. “The Philippines is dishonest in its statements, deliberately stirs up trouble, maliciously incites and sensationalizes, and continues to undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea region.”China’s Foreign Ministry has lodged a solemn representation with the Philippines to extend its “strongest protest,” spokesperson Mao Ning said in a regular press briefing Tuesday.In December, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson accused the Philippines of making repeated provocations and infringing on China’s sovereignty. Earlier in 2023, China also accused the Philippines of attempting to deliver “construction materials” to reinforce the Sierra Madre, which meant “the Chinese side was made to respond with necessary moves” adding that the China Coast Guard “took warning law enforcement measures.”At first glance it’s hard to imagine why these remote, unpopulated reefs and atolls are so hotly contested – but they lie in a strategic location in Asia’s main shipping lane, which has more than $3.4 trillion in trade passing through it every year, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ (CSIS) China Power Project.Over the last few decades, China has built up tiny reefs and sandbars far from its shores across the waterway into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants.The Philippines says the development of Mischief Reef, close to Second Thomas Shoal, was what originally prompted them to ground the Sierra Madre.In 2016, in a case brought by the Philippines, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China’s claim to historic rights to the bulk of the sea had no legal basis.But Beijing has rejected the tribunal’s ruling and continued its military buildup, with many features lying hundreds of miles away from China’s mainland. It also maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels – which has frequently stoked tensions with its neighbors.China’s Foreign Ministry has long defended the behavior of its vessels in the South China Sea and said Beijing will “firmly safeguard” what it views as its territorial sovereignty. It insists that the Philippines is illegally occupying the Second Thomas Shoal.The US military also maintains a regular presence in the South China Sea, with aircraft overflights, so-called “freedom of navigation” operations, and patrols and exercises with allies and partners to assert that the South China Sea is an international waterway.Since his election in 2021, Philippines President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., has taken a stronger line against China, in a departure from the foreign policy approach of his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who trod much more softly with Beijing in return for economic cooperation.Last week, Marcos Jr. told Australian lawmakers that his country is on the “front line” of maritime disputes and “will not yield” an inch of territory.The Philippines ambassador to the US, Jose Manuel Romualdez, also said last week that the South China Sea - not Taiwan - is the “real flashpoint” for an armed conflict in the region, and warned that “all hell breaks loose” if Washington decides to invoke its mutual defense treaty to protect Manila, according to the state-run Philippine News Agency.Diplomacy has taken place between the two sides, with a bilateral meeting held in Shanghai between China and the Philippines late January and both sides agreeing to calm tensions and find ways to communicate over their differences.But the reality out at sea is quite different.For the Filipinos who conduct this resupply mission every month, the maritime confrontations with China have become routine.The missions are exhausting and dangerous, and often carried out in sweltering temperatures, but there’s a sense of pride among the crew, who believe they are trying to protect their nation’s territory. They call themselves “Coast Guardians.”The Japanese-built BRP Camra MRRV 4409 Coast Guard vessel – the ship which CNN joined - was previously water cannoned by the China Coast Guard, and it was involved in a collision with a Chinese fishing vessel.On Tuesday, CNN witnessed Chinese ships carrying out several risky maneuvers around the vessel, including a China Coast Guard ship which stopped right in front of the Camra’s path, and also steamed past dangerously close to the starboard side of the vessel. Large “maritime militia” vessels also sailed within a few meters of the Camra.Tarriela, the Coast Guard spokesperson, said a China Coast Guard vessel had come within 20 yards (60 feet) of the Cabra.The ship has 23 crew on board this deployment, some of whom told CNN that they had been on a years-long deployment on this ship, working 12-hour days for two months straight, then taking a month off back on shore with their families.Under conditions imposed by the Philippine Coast Guard, CNN was unable to speak on record to any crew members.The women and the officers on board stay in bunk rooms, and the rest of the crew sleep in a communal room below deck, which also doubles up as the dining hall – unfortunately making it a favorite spot for cockroaches.But the living conditions on the coast guard vessel are still far better than on the wreck of the Sierra Madre.A decade ago, former CNN journalist Tomas Etzler traveled out to the shoal and stayed with the marines on the rusting ruin of the rat- and roach-infested vessel.They caught their own fish and cooked them on board for most of their meals, and they tried to create a makeshift gym using random items on the deck as weights.To make their time a little easier, care packages are sometimes airdropped into the ocean – in 2014, that included letters of support from schoolchildren, and fried chicken from the Philippine fast food institution Jollibee.The marines, who usually carry out a 90-day deployment on the ship, are sometimes rotated out during the resupply missions at sea – with a successful rotation carried out on Tuesday, said Tarriela.During the mission, only one of the two resupply boats successfully made it to the Sierra Madre due to the Chinese maritime blockade, reducing their supplies until next month’s attempted mission – which will likely face the same confrontations with China. Still, the fact that they managed to deliver supplies at all made the trip “a success,” Tarriela said.A US warship, the USS Mobile, was spotted on the Philippine crews’ journey out on Monday evening, ahead of the confrontation with Beijing, said Tarriela. However, he said, the Philippines did not coordinate with the US during the operation.After the clash on Tuesday, the US released a statement saying it “stands with our ally the Philippines following (China’s) provocative actions against lawful Philippine maritime operations in the South China Sea on March 5.”It also pointed to its mutual defense treaty with the Philippines, which it said “extends to armed attacks on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft – including those of its Coast Guard – anywhere in the South China Sea.”Analysts say China employs “gray zone” tactics around Second Thomas shoal, carrying out actions just below what might be considered acts of war but that achieve the same result: Beijing gaining territory or control without firing a shot.But Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said it may be time for the US to reevaluate what constitutes an act of war after watching the video of the water cannon smashing the Philippine vessel’s windows.“Without clarifying what ‘armed attack’ constitutes, this episode will keep recurring since Beijing senses impunity,” Koh said.Ray Powell, director of SeaLight at the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford University, said the onus is on Philippine partners and allies, like the US, to take new actions to push back on China.“Will the US, its allies, other members of the international community, will they get together and say something more than finger-wagging has to happen here?” Powell said.“Because we’ve tried that, and it doesn’t seem to be discouraging or deterring China at all.”"

        "title": "Talks for Gaza ceasefire at a standstill, no deal likely by Ramadan",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "A ceasefire deal in Gaza that would see Israeli hostages freed and the first break in the fighting in more than three months is unlikely to happen by the start of Ramadan which the Biden administration had been aiming for, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.Negotiators had hoped to have a draft agreement this week after days of meetings in Cairo, “but it won’t happen,” said one diplomat familiar with the discussions who described the last few days of talks as “very hectic.”Two American officials agreed that the prospects are not promising of Israel and Hamas agreeing to the temporary truce by the start of the Muslim holy month early next week.“Hope is fading,” one US official said.A failure to achieve a deal in the next few days would come after weeks of US President Joe Biden and administration officials saying an agreement needs to be in place by Ramadan to avoid escalation of the five-month war. He warned Tuesday that without a ceasefire by then the region could become “very, very dangerous.”Israel has also warned that if the Israeli hostages being held in Gaza aren’t home by Ramadan they will launch a military offensive into Rafah in southern Gaza where around 1.5 million Palestinians are trying to seek safety from the fighting.Representatives from Hamas, Egypt, Qatar and the United States had gathered this week in the Egyptian capital for more talks while Israel refused to send a delegation because Hamas has not yet provided a list of hostages who are alive and dead, a recent demand by Israel.The Biden administration insists Israel has already accepted the broad terms of a six-week pause while Hamas is holding out.A Hamas delegation left Cairo on Thursday after days of talks with no obvious breakthrough in negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in exchange for hostage releases. Egypt state-run Al Qahera news, citing a senior source, said that the delegation has left to consult on the proposals, and that negotiations will resume next week.“It’s in the hands of Hamas right now,” Biden told reporters on Tuesday as he boarded Air Force One. He had raised hopes last week saying that a ceasefire could be in place by this past Monday, a prediction he later admitted was unlikely.One thing the administration and Hamas agree on is the desire for a temporary, six-week truce to turn into a permanent ceasefire without a resumption in the fighting. Biden officials have said they believe the pause could evolve into a more enduring peace, while Israel has maintained they plan to continue efforts to dismantle Hamas, particularly in Rafah.Hope is not lost that a first phase could be launched soon, the diplomat cautioned, saying they believe an agreement could be possible in the first week or two of Ramadan.But the deadly incident last week in which more than 100 Palestinians were killed in Gaza City when an aid convoy was mobbed and Israeli forces opened fire “took us back 10 steps,” the diplomat said. Hamas then presented a response to a negotiated framework to mediators that “no one is happy about.”A deal, if successful, is expected to include multiple phases. In the first stage, when the fighting would stop for at least six weeks, around 40 Israeli elderly, female, sick and wounded hostages are expected to be released. In parallel, Israel would also free Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisoners, a number that could be in the hundreds.Hamas had backed off some of its more stringent demands, sources had told CNN, but following last week’s “Flour Massacre,” as it has become known, the group pushed for more assurances. Namely that in the first phase the Israeli military would pull back from Gazan cities and in a second withdraw from the enclave altogether, according to the diplomat who said the IDF is refusing to agree to those points.Not only do Palestinians from northern Gaza need to be able to return to what is left of their homes, Hamas has argued in the talks, but do so without going through IDF checkpoints. There are demands by Hamas, the diplomat said, that specific machinery be provided to move rubble as well as field hospitals and clinics.Hamas said its delegation left Cairo Thursday “to consult with the movement’s leadership, as negotiations and efforts continue to stop the aggression, return the displaced, and bring relief aid to our Palestinian people,” the group said in a statement.On Wednesday Hamas argued that it had “shown flexibility” but Israel continued to “evade the obligations of the agreement” being discussed.“We have affirmed our conditions for a ceasefire: complete [IDF] withdrawal from the sector, the return of displaced persons to the areas they left, especially in the north, and the provision of sufficient aid, relief, and reconstruction,” Hamas senior leader Osama Hamdan told a news conference in Beirut on Tuesday.Ramadan, a month of fasting and piety for Muslims, is a “period in which you have calm and you’re able to do the essential humanitarian work,” a senior administration official told reporters in a weekend briefing.About a quarter of Gaza’s population is on the brink of famine, according to the United Nations. The Biden administration has escalated its criticism of Israel’s refusal to open more border crossings to allow aid into Gaza, particularly to address needs in the north.“There are no excuses,” Biden posted on X.Even without a ceasefire, said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday, it is urgent “to dramatically increase the humanitarian assistance that’s getting to people inside of Gaza. The situation with children, women and men who are caught in this crossfire of Hamas’ making inside of Gaza is unacceptable and not sustainable.”Blinken made the comments before a meeting with Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, a central player in the ceasefire mediation. In their meeting, Blinken acknowledged that the pause and hostage deal is unlikely before the start of Ramadan, said a person familiar with the meeting.The same person said the CIA Director Bill Burns, who has been leading the administration’s efforts in the negotiations, had a long meeting with Thani during the latter’s visit to Washington.Bill Burns has traveled back to the Middle East, according to a US official and another source familiar with the trip.The sources said Burns was in Egypt on Wednesday before traveling to Qatar on Thursday. Burns is not expected to stop in Israel on this trip, the US official said, nor is there expected to be a “quad” format meeting with the Egyptian and Israeli intelligence chiefs and the Qatari Prime Minister, as there was in Paris two weeks ago.“We continue to believe that the obstacles are not insurmountable and that a deal can be reached,” State Department spokesman Matt Miller said Wednesday when asked about the lack of a breakthrough. “The deal is in the interest of Israel. It’s in the interest of the Palestinian people. And it’s in the interest of the broader region, so we’re going to continue to push for one.”"

        "title": "Photographer steps inside Vietnam’s shadowy ‘click farms’",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Jack Latham was on a mission to photograph farms in Vietnam — not the country’s sprawling plantations or rice terraces but its “click farms.”Last year, the British photographer spent a month in the capital Hanoi documenting some of the shadowy enterprises that help clients artificially boost online traffic and social media engagement in the hope of manipulating algorithms and user perceptions. The resulting images, which feature in his new book “Beggar’s Honey,” provide rare insight into the workshops that hire low-paid workers to cultivate likes, comments and shares for businesses and individuals globally.“When most people are on social media, they want nothing but attention — they’re begging for it,” Latham said in a phone interview, explaining his book’s title. “With social media, our attention is a product for advertisers and marketers.”In the 2000s, the growing popularity of social media sites — including Facebook and Twitter, now called X — created a new market for well-curated digital profiles, with companies and brands vying to maximize visibility and influence. Though it is unclear when click farms began proliferating, tech experts warned about “virtual gang masters” operating them from low-income countries as early as 2007.In the following decades, click farms exploded in number — particularly in Asia, where they can be found across India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines and beyond. Regulations have often failed to keep pace: While some countries, like China, have attempted to crack down on operations (the China Advertising Association banned the use of click farms for commercial gain in 2020), they continue to flourish around the continent, especially in places where low labor and electricity costs make it affordable to power hundreds of devices simultaneously.Latham’s project took him to five click farms in Vietnam. (The click farmers he hoped to photograph in Hong Kong “got cold feet,” he said, and pandemic-related travel restrictions dashed his plans to document the practice in mainland China). On the outskirts of Hanoi, Latham visited workshops operating from residential properties and hotels.Some had a traditional setup with hundreds of manually operated phones, while others used a newer, compact method called “box farming” — a phrase used by the click farmers Latham visited — where several phones, without screens and batteries, are wired together and linked to a computer interface.Latham said one of the click farms he visited was a family-run business, though the others appeared more like a tech companies. Most workers were in their 20s and 30s, he added.“They all looked like Silicon Valley startups,” he said. “There was a tremendous amount of hardware … whole walls of phones.”Some of Latham’s photos depict — albeit anonymously — workers tasked with harvesting clicks. In one image, a man is seen stationed amid a sea of gadgets in what appears to be a lonely and monotonous task.“It only takes one person to control large amounts of phones,” Latham said. “One person can very quickly (do the work of) 10,000. It’s both solitary and crowded.”At the farms Lathan visited, individuals were usually in charge of a particular social media platforms. For instance, one “farmer” would be responsible for mass posting and commenting on Facebook accounts, or setting up YouTube platforms where they post and watch videos on loop. The photographer added that TikTok is now the most popular platform at the click farms he visited.The click farmers Latham spoke to mostly advertised their services online for less than one cent per click, view or interaction. And despite the fraudulent nature of their tasks, they seemed to treat it like just another job, the photographer said.‘There was an understanding they were just providing a service,” he added. “There wasn’t a shadiness. What they’re offering is shortcuts.”Across its 134 pages, “Beggar’s Honey” includes a collection of abstract photographs — some seductive, others contemplative — depicting videos that appeared on Latham’s TikTok feed. He included them in the book to represent the kind of content he saw being boosted by click farms.But many of his photos focus on the hardware used to manipulate social media —webs of wires, phones and computers.“A lot of my work is about conspiracies,” Latham said. ” Trying to ‘document the machines used to spread disinformation’ is the tagline of the project. The bigger picture is often the thing we don’t see.”Click farms around the world are also used to amplify political messages and spread disinformation during elections. In 2016, Cambodia’s then-prime minister Hun Sen was accused of buying Facebook friends and likes, which according to the BBC he denied, while shadowy operations in North Macedonia were found to have spread pro-Donald Trump posts and articles during that year’s US presidential election.While researching, Latham said he found that algorithms — a topic of his previous book, “Latent Bloom” — often recommended videos that he said got increasingly “extreme” with each click.“If you only digest a diet of that, it’s a matter of time you become diabetically conspiratorial,” he said. “The spreading of disinformation is the worst thing. It happens in your pocket, not newspapers, and it’s terrifying that it’s tailored to your kind of neurosis.”Hoping to raise awareness of the phenomenon and its dangers, Latham is planning to exhibit his own home version of a click farm — a small box with several phones attached to a computer interface — at the 2024 Images Vevey Festival in Switzerland. He bought the gadget in Vietnam for the equivalent of about $1,000 and has occasionally experimented with it on his social media accounts.On Instagram, Latham’s photos usually attract anywhere from a few dozen to couple hundred likes. But when he deployed his personal click farm to announce his latest book, the post generated more than 6,600 likes. The photographer wants people to realize that there’s more to what they see on social media — and that metrics aren’t a measurement of authenticity.“When people are better equipped with knowledge of how things work, they can make more informed decisions,” he said.“Beggar’s Honey,” co-published by Here Press and Images Vevey, is available now."

        "title": "Israeli forces fired at Palestinians waiting for aid in northern Gaza, eyewitnesses say",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Israeli forces opened fire on people waiting for aid on Monday night in northern Gaza, eyewitnesses told CNN.The shooting took place at the Kuwait Roundabout on Rasheed Street in Gaza City shortly before midnight, said one eyewitness, who had traveled there to try to get flour.“There was sporadic fire… we could see the red tracer bullets over our heads,” another eyewitness, a local journalist, told CNN.CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.The incident came just days after one of the worst single tragedies to occur during Israel’s war with Hamas, when scores of Palestinians were killed trying to access food aid in Gaza City.Last Thursday, IDF troops opened fire as Palestinians attempted to take aid off trucks entering northern Gaza at night. The aid trucks tried to leave the area, accidentally ramming others and causing further deaths and injuries, an eyewitness told CNN. At least 118 people were killed and 760 injured, according to Gaza’s health ministry. The IDF said it had fired warning shots to disperse the crowd after seeing that people were being trampled.It is unclear if there were any casualties in Monday’s incident. Overnight data from the health ministry did not specify.Israel has for months limited the flow of aid into Gaza, however some trucks have been allowed into the northern part of the strip where hunger is most acute. Amid a collapse of public authority in Gaza, the arrival of aid trucks has sparked chaos and disorder that often leaves thousands at risk of harm during the distribution.Thousands of residents of northern Gaza often travel for miles to wait for hours in the hope of receiving some of the limited aid entering the enclave. Many leave with nothing.The World Health Organization on Monday warned that a growing number of children in Gaza are dying of starvation and dehydration. A WHO team found “severe levels of malnutrition, children dying of starvation, serious shortages of fuel, food and medical supplies,” during a recent visit to sites in northern Gaza.After last week’s deadly aid delivery, the United States for the first time air-dropped humanitarian aid into Gaza. More than 38,000 meals were dropped Saturday along the Gaza coastline in a combined operation by the US Air Force and the Royal Jordanian Air Force. A further 36,800 were dropped Tuesday, according to US Central Command.The growing risk of starvation in Gaza has reinforced the urgency of ongoing ceasefire talks. US Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday called for an “immediate ceasefire” to last at least six weeks, saying Palestinians in the enclave are “starving” because of “inhumane” conditions and urging Israel to provide more aid.Ceasefire talks between mediators and Hamas are continuing in Cairo but there are “difficulties,” Egyptian state media Al Qahera News reported, citing a senior source. The source denied that talks had broken down, as some media organizations earlier reported.Talks have failed to make significant headway, and it’s unclear how much progress can be made at all, as Israel has not sent a delegation there."

        "category": "world",
        "text": "Intruders broke into a major port terminal in Haiti Thursday as violence in the country escalated after the government extended its state of emergency.The Haitian government decreed the state of emergency would be extended to April 3 in the country’s West Region and the capital Port-au-Prince. A curfew has been extended to March 10.It comes as Port-au-Prince’s Caribbean Port Services (CPS) terminal, a major player in Haiti’s food import supply chain, was broken into around 8 a.m., two security sources told CNN. The intruders headed to the terminal’s gated warehouse area that houses many containers, the sources said.The source said the unrest at the port continues.Video of the port on Thursday showed hundreds of people on the streets around the facility and what appeared to be dozens of people breaking into the gated warehouse. CPS did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.Exclusive satellite imagery from Airbus seen by CNN showed people massing outside of the area and crowds moving in through an opening to the street.One Airbus satellite image shows a significant amount of material littering the area of the container port terminal. Another image, taken Wednesday, shows a Haitian National Police MRAP – mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle – on a major roadway.A security source told CNN that the MRAP was positioned there to prevent G9 gang coalition leader Jimmy Cherizier from expanding attacks and particularly from moving toward the airport road.Elsewhere in Port-au-Prince, satellite images show blockades – some constructed by local residents and others by gangs – along major streets, closing off entire neighborhoods.Port-au-Prince has been gripped by a wave of highly coordinated gang attacks on law enforcement and state institutions in what gang leader Cherizier has described as an attempt to overthrow Prime Minister Ariel Henry’s government.Armed groups have burned down police stations and released thousands of inmates from two prisons, and Cherizier has warned of “a civil war that will end in genocide” if the prime minister does not step down, Reuters reported Tuesday.The chaos has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes in the past few days, adding to the more than 300,000 already displaced by gang violence.It is also affecting the distribution of essential supplies by aid organizations. The World Food Programme suspended its maritime transport services in Port-au-Prince from distributing aid across Haiti due to the instability.Two dozen trucks of aid, filled with food, medical supplies, and equipment, are stuck at the port in Port-au-Prince, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a Thursday statement.Maritime routes are the only way to transport aid, especially food and medical supplies for humanitarian and development organizations, from Port-au-Prince to the rest of the country, said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary-General and OCHA.Haiti’s healthcare system is “near collapse,” and many health centers have been forced to reduce their operations due to violence and lack of personnel and medicine, Dujarric said.Only one public hospital remains operational in Port-au-Prince’s metropolitan area, according to an official at the country’s Civil Protection, and emergency services are severely hampered.Hôpital Universitaire la Paix has received nearly 70 patients with gunshot wounds since the weekend and several medical centers in the country have been burned down in the past day, the official said.Doctors in Haiti are desperate for help amid a lack of oxygen and a shortage of water.“There is no oxygen available, no water neither to service the hospitals because of the shutdown of the pumps to provide water to people,” Ronald Laroche, a doctor who runs a network of private hospitals told CNN. “Most hospitals have closed their doors in the heart of the capital.”Laroche runs a network of more than 20 medical centers throughout Haiti, two of which have been destroyed by gangs, he said. “They (gangs) turned them into their general quarters. Seven of our medical centers had to close their doors as well to prevent our employees from being kidnapped.”Haiti’s Civil Protection told CNN that they’ve been “unable” to gather information on civilian injuries and deaths since this latest wave of violence.The US has been urging Prime Minister Henry to clear the way for a political transition in Haiti, which Haitian officials say could be structured with the initial appointment of a three-member transitional council that would select an interim president to lead the country.The unelected leader came to power in 2021 with the backing of the United States, Canada and other key allies, following the assassination of former President Jovenel Moise. He promised to hold elections in 2023, but they never transpired, with Henry’s administration citing the country’s insecurity as a major obstacle.Henry has had difficulty returning to the country this week. His plane was diverted to the US territory of Puerto Rico after the Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti, refused to let it land.When the violence broke out last Friday, Henry was in Kenya to sign an agreement for a Kenyan-led multinational mission to restore security in the Caribbean nation.Nearby nations have been securing their borders following the outbreak of violence. A maritime blockade was established in the southeastern Bahamas amid fears of mass migration from Haiti, Commodore Raymond King of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force (RBDF), said at a press conference on Thursday.King said officials are particularly concerned about the jailbreaks, fearing the prison escapees will try to flee Haiti by boat.While security has deteriorated in recent months, Haiti has for years suffered chronic violence, political crisis and drought, leaving some 5.5 million Haitians – about half the population – in need of humanitarian assistance.More than 40% of deaths in the impoverished neighborhood of Cité Soleil in the Haitian capital have been caused by violence, according to a survey conducted by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) that studied the period between July 25 and August 24, 2023. MSF said the mortality rate is comparable to those seen during exceptionally violent periods in Syria and Myanmar."

        "title": "Argentina’s Milei bans gender-inclusive language in official documents",
        "category": "world",
        "text": "Argentina’s President Javier Milei has banned the use of gender-inclusive language in the government, including in all official documents, the presidential spokesperson said Tuesday, as the far-right libertarian continues to implement his socially conservative agenda.The ban, effective immediately, will prohibit “inclusive language and everything related to the gender perspective throughout the national public administration,” Manuel Adornis, spokesperson for the Casa Rosada, said in his daily press conference.Spanish is a gender-defined language where most nouns are given a masculine “o” ending or a feminine “a” ending. In an effort to create gender-inclusive language in Spanish-speaking countries, there has been a push to use “x,” “e,” or “@” to create general-neutral nouns instead of using “o” or “a.” For example, the gender-neutral term “Latinx” as opposed to the masculine “Latino” or feminine “Latina.”Going forward, “it will not be possible to use the letter ‘e,’ ​​the ‘@’ sign, the ‘x’,” Adornis said, adding that people should also “avoid the unnecessary use of the feminine in all public administration documents.”Adornis rejected the argument that gender-inclusive language covers all demographics of society, saying, “the language that covers all sectors is the one we use; it is the Castilian language, it is Spanish,” he said.“Gender perspectives” have been used as a political tool, the spokesperson said.This announcement comes after gender-inclusive language was banned in the military following a resolution by the country’s defense ministry.The debate around gender-neutral language has become a lightning rod in the culture wars in the Americas, with Milei previously railing against “gender ideology” – a term that has gained prominence in recent years among social conservatives who oppose LGBTQ rights.The change comes after Argentina became the first country in Latin America to allow a different option in the “gender” field of identity documents. In 2021, the government of former President Alberto Fernández announced a new National Identity Document (DNI) for nonbinary people that establishes the terminology “x” in the field of gender for amended DNI and passports.Fernández also used inclusive language during his speeches, in stark contrast to Milei, a social conservative with ties to the American right, who opposes abortion rights and has called climate change a “lie of socialism.”Since coming to power last year, Milei has pursued conservative culture war issues. Last week, his government announced the closure of its anti-discrimination agency, saying the Ministry of Justice would absorb its functions."

        "category": "world",
        "text": "Akira Toriyama, the Japanese manga artist who created the enormously popular and influential Dragon Ball series, died of a brain condition last week at the age of 68, his production studio said Friday.Toriyama was the mind behind the fantasy martial arts franchise featuring Son Goku, a boy from outer space with superhuman strength and a monkey tail who embarks on a quest for the seven dragon balls.The Dragon Ball universe remains one of Japan’s most successful global hits, captivating the hearts of many manga-loving teens and adults from around the world since its debut in the 1980s.Toriyama’s death was announced on Friday by Dragon Ball’s official website in a shared statement from Bird Studio and Capsule Corporation Tokyo.“It’s our deep regret that he still had several works in the middle of creation with great enthusiasm,” it said.“He would have many more things to achieve. However, he has left many manga titles and works of art to this world,” it added, thanking fans for their support on Toriyama’s behalf.The artist died of acute subdural hematoma, a form of brain bleeding, the statement said.Born on April 5, 1955 in Kiyosu City, Aichi prefecture, Toriyama began drawing manga at the age of 23.He made his debut as a cartoonist in 1978 by submitting a short story to manga fans’ magazine Weekly Shonen Jump.His “Dragon Ball” series went on to be featured in the same magazine in 1984 and was front and center of a creative career that spanned more than four decades.The franchise is based on classic Chinese novel Journey to the West and has since been adapted into into anime and the 2009 Hollywood action movie “Dragon Ball Evolution.”As Son Goku sets off for his quest in search of the seven dragon balls, he fights off villains along the way and protects the Earth. As he ages, the storyline shifts to his descendants and friends.The dragon balls, when collected, can summon Shen Long, a divine dragon that can grant any wish. Son often ended up spending the wishes on his friends or restoring a heavily destructed Earth in the series centered on courage, friendship and kinship.Prominent Japanese author and game designer Yuji Horii, a longtime friend of Toriyama, said they worked on the popular game Dragon Quest together.“I can’t believe he’s gone,” he wrote on social media platform X.Eiichiro Oda, creator of manga series “One Piece,” said the thought of never seeing his friend Toriyama again “fills me with sadness.”Toriyama “took the baton from the era when reading manga would make you stupid, and created an era where both adults and children read and enjoy manga. He showed us the dream that manga can do things like this and that we can go to the world,” Oda said on the Shonen Jump website.Many fans also paid tribute to the manga heavyweight online.“Dragon Ball was my textbook for life. It taught me that I could overcome any hardship if I worked on it cheerfully and with enjoyment,” one fan wrote on X."

        "text": "Miami-Dade County told the Dolphin Company, which runs the Miami Seaquarium, in a letter on Thursday that the county is terminating the company’s lease for the property because of violations in how it is maintained.Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said in a news conference that terminating the lease is the best path forward for the safety of the animals, residents and visitors.The Dolphin Company has been told it must vacate by April 21.The Seaquarium is home to roughly 500 animals that include fish, birds, reptiles and marine mammals, Levine Cava said. It is located on the island of Virginia Key in Biscayne Bay.All the animals are owned by the Dolphin Company, and it is up to them what happens to them, she said. The mayor added that the county is working on contingency plans in case any animals are left behind when the company vacates.Eduardo Alberto, CEO of the Dolphin Company, posted on social media platform X during the mayor’s news conference that “we are outside and anything she haas [sic] to say about @MiamiSeaquarium we have the right to hear and be heard. … Waiting outside your office mayor. Dare to speak in front of us.”CNN has reached out to the company for comment.“The current state of the Miami Seaquarium is unsustainable and unsafe,” Levine Cava said during the news conference. “Meanwhile, our number one priority continues to be the safety and wellbeing of the animals, and moving forward we’ll do everything we can to ensure that they are well cared for.”The Seaquarium has failed to maintain the Flipper Stadium, Manatee Tank Area and Dolphin Stadium, the county said. Other violations include several structures not being maintained property, and dangerous conditions have resulted in injuries to some animals, the county said.There are also decaying animal habitats, lack of veterinary staff and lack of experience by some staff handling the animals, Levine Cava added.The Seaquarium was home to Lolita, a killer whale that was taken from the ocean in 1970.Last year, Lolita was set to be released back into the ocean after animal welfare activists fought for her release. Lolita died before she could be released.The advocacy group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) celebrated the news in a posted statement on its website.“After more than 50 years of miserable animals and false promises to clean up its act, the Seaquarium’s impending shutdown is overdue,” said PETA Vice President Tracy Reiman. “And PETA looks to Miami-Dade County authorities to keep up the good work by ensuring that these animals are sent to reputable facilities where they’ll get the care they so desperately need.”CNN’s Rebekah Riess contributed to this report."

        "title": "3 very different border realities",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Three completely different border realities were displayed Thursday.► There’s the Donald Trump reality, where President Joe Biden is to blame and a military force is needed to shut the border, control an invasion of “murderers,” round up the undocumented and expel them from the US.► There’s the Biden reality, where Trump is to blame for killing a bipartisan compromise that would have given all presidents new powers to control the influx of migrants and streamline a broken asylum process.► And there’s the lived reality of children and families facing hunger and hypothermia in open-air camps along the border.That grim picture was presented in court filings related to the camps near the US-Mexico border in California, which seek to force the federal government to better protect the well-being of people who are waiting to make asylum claims. Read CNN’s report, which includes images of a girl in a cast deposited at an open-air camp and a woman trapped in the slats of border fencing.The 3.3 million case backlog of asylum claims is one of the main problems of the current immigration policy crisis, and the bipartisan bill would have sought to address it by adding workers at the border and beefing up the immigration court system. The fact that people can live in the US for years before their asylum claim is ultimately heard has been cited as a reason that so many continue to make the dangerous journey.Don’t expect to hear anything from the migrant perspective from Trump, who visited the border at Eagle Pass, Texas, on Thursday. He is promising a drastic deportation effort.“I will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” Trump promised in a video posted Wednesday to his social media platform.Making use of his trademark hyperbole, Trump referred to migrants as “Joe Biden’s illegals and murderers.”Planning is already underway in Trump’s sphere about how to go about such an effort. If, as seems likely, Congress didn’t green-light such an operation, CNN has reported Trump could attempt to redirect funds from the Pentagon, a tactic he tried during his first term in office to fund a border wall.Any such roundup and deportation effort, according to the CNN report from last year, “would necessitate building large camps to house migrants waiting for deportation and tapping federal and local law enforcement to assist with large-scale arrests of undocumented immigrants across the country.”There is a model in US history for such an effort. “Operation Wetback,” which made use of a derogatory term that sounds horrible in hindsight, was a military-style operation during the Dwight Eisenhower administration.Trump cited that ugly chapter in his 2016 run for president. It is remarkable how in the intervening years his rhetoric on immigration has not changed.CNN reported on the history of the 1950s deportation effort in 2016. It described how US agents “plucked Mexican laborers from fields and ranches in targeted raids, bused them to detention centers along the border, and ultimately sent many of them deep into the interior of Mexico, some by airlift, others on cargo boats that typically hauled bananas.”CNN’s Rosa Flores reported before Trump’s speech from Shelby Park in Eagle Pass. That’s the recreation area along the Rio Grande seized by the state national guard. They have kicked US Border Patrol out of that area and plan to build a military base there. State officials have lined the river in Eagle Pass with concertina wire, shipping containers and buoys to deter people from crossing.These efforts by the state to take over border security from the federal government are the subject of ongoing court disputes.Trump’s visit, CNN’s Stephen Collinson, Priscilla Alvarez and MJ Lee wrote ahead of the trip, “will showcase his dark portrayal of a nation under siege from a torrent of what he claims are migrant criminals and invaders.”“This looks very militarized,” Flores said, a contrast to the background chosen by the White House for Biden, who also visited the border on Thursday, 300 miles downriver in Brownsville.The Washington Post had an interesting comparison between the two areas and guessed at why Brownsville, which is much more used to larger volumes of migrant crossings, has been able to more easily absorb the influx.Speaking on Air Force One en route to Texas, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Brownsville is a model of how the migrant crisis should be handled: not with a standoff between Texas and the federal government, but with cooperation.“Brownsville demonstrates the impact of that partnership when everyone’s working together to address a shared challenge,” he said.Biden has shifted in recent weeks, going on offense on the issue of immigration after Trump successfully pressured Republicans on Capitol Hill to kill the bipartisan border bill.US voters are on track to get a choice between Biden’s and Trump’s realities in November if, as expected, the two men clinch their respective major party nominations. The migrants fleeing to the US despite the risks must feel like they have run out of options."

        "title": "Biden directs US military to establish aid port in Gaza as Israel-Hamas war looms over his State of the Union",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "As President Joe Biden addressed Congress and the nation during his State of the Union speech on Thursday, tens of thousands of Palestinians face an increasingly harrowing humanitarian crisis – one that officials warn is hurling the territory into a famine.Although Biden had signaled repeated optimism that a temporary ceasefire could soon offer some relief for the beleaguered territory, the prospects of that happening any time soon seemed to be growing dimmer.Biden on Thursday announced efforts that could offer some relief: the US military will begin establishing a port in the territory that could receive large shipments of critically needed food and medical supplies.“A temporary pier would enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day,” Biden said during his address on Thursday. “And Israel must also do its part. Israel must allow more aid into Gaza and ensure that humanitarian workers aren’t caught in the cross fire.”And in some of his most forceful remarks about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza since the war began, Biden sent a message to Israeli leadership.“Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority,” Biden said.The only real solution to the conflict, Biden added, is a two-state solution.The announcement from Biden underscores the seriousness of the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, as the UN World Food Program warned that a famine is looming and 500,000 people are at risk of starvation.At least 20 people had died as of Wednesday due to malnutrition and dehydration since the war began in Gaza, according to the territory’s Ministry of Health.The youngest child to die of starvation and lack of medical attention was one day old, health officials in Gaza said. More than 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began relentless ground and air attacks shortly after the October 7 attack by Hamas that killed about 1,200 people in Israel.More than 72,000 people have been injured.It’s not clear when the port would be up and running. It’s also not clear why the administration waited until the State of the Union to announce heightened efforts to get aid into the territory.“The famine is deepening and will claim thousands of citizens if the aggression is not stopped and humanitarian and medical aid is not immediately entered” into Gaza, Health Ministry spokesperson Dr. Ashraf Al-Qidra said Wednesday.Biden’s remarks come at a critical flashpoint in Israel’s war against Hamas, as the holy Muslim month of Ramadan approaches without a ceasefire in place. Biden said earlier this week that in the absence of a ceasefire when Ramadan begins, the situation in Gaza could become “very, very dangerous.”Israel, meanwhile, has warned that they will launch a military offensive in the crowded city of Rafah in southern Gaza, where 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering, if remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza are not returned before the start of Ramadan.Officials were hopeful about the chance of a deal that would temporarily pause fighting while Israeli hostages in Gaza, along with Palestinians held in prison by Israel, were released.But the killing of more than 100 Palestinian civilians after Israeli forces opened fire at a food distribution site last week in what became known as the “Flour Massacre” disrupted the pace of the peace talks, a diplomat said, adding the killings “took us back 10 steps.”While the United Nations welcomed the news of the US military’s intent to establish an aid port, officials advocated for road access into the territory as “the only solution” to avert a starvation crisis."

        "title": "Jill Biden’s State of the Union guests include Alabama IVF patient, Swedish prime minister and UAW chief",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "An Alabama woman seeking in vitro fertilization, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain are among those headed to the US Capitol Thursday evening as President Joe Biden is set to deliver a high-stakes State of the Union address.Biden’s speech could offer his most substantial television audience before voters cast their ballots in the general election, and the remarks are expected to center around the key themes of his reelection campaign, agenda accomplishments and what’s at stake in November.The guest list for first lady Dr. Jill Biden’s box offers a blueprint for the president’s address as he leans on personal stories to put faces to critical issues facing Americans.“Each of these individuals were invited by the White House because they personify issues or themes to be addressed by the president in his speech, or they embody the Biden-Harris Administration’s policies at work for the American people,” her office said in a statement.Here’s who to look for during Thursday’s speech:President Biden is leaning into his argument for protecting reproductive rights in the aftermath of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, and he is expected to highlight personal stories of those impacted by numerous laws in states across the country. The campaign is making abortion a centerpiece of its messaging as it seeks to court moderate voters – particularly women.Kate Cox, the Texas mother of two who fought a high-profile legal battle with her state after being denied an abortion to end a high-risk pregnancy, will be present Thursday as Biden puts a face on the issue.The first lady is also hosting Latorya Beasley, a Birmingham, Alabama, woman who was in the process of expanding her family through in vitro fertilization “when her embryo transfer was abruptly canceled as a result of the recent Alabama Supreme Court decision,” the White House said.And Maria Shriver, the journalist and women’s health advocate, will be present. Shriver, who is a cousin of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., teamed up with the first lady to launch the White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research.Though Biden’s signature student loan forgiveness program hit a major legal roadblock last year when the Supreme Court rejected his plan, the president has looked for other ways to ease the burden on borrowers, an issue aimed at attracting younger voters saddled with debt. Nearly $138 billion of federal student loan debt has been canceled for almost 3.9 million borrowers since Biden took office.One such beneficiary, Keenan Jones, will be on site Thursday as Biden touts his moves to boost debt relief. Jones, a public middle school teacher from Plymouth, Minnesota, received student loan debt forgiveness through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.The president is likely to address multiple crises abroad, including Russia’s war in Ukraine, now in its third year, and the Israel-Hamas war in the aftermath of the October 7 attacks. Multiple families of those believed to be held hostage by Hamas will be guests of lawmakers.The first lady will host Shelby Nikitin, a US Navy officer who was in command of the USS Thomas Hudner in the Red Sea, where Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels have stepped up strikes on ships.“Under her leadership, the ship deployed to protect maritime shipping from illegal, dangerous, and destabilizing Houthi attacks against vessels transiting the Red Sea,” the White House said.Nikitin was awarded the Bronze Star for her leadership.As Biden works to draw contrasts with former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, he is likely to highlight his efforts to shore up US alliances and preserve and strengthen American democracy. Biden delivered remarks near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, earlier this year where he condemned political violence and called out what he cast as Trump’s continuing assault on democracy.On Thursday, Sweden is set to formally become the 32nd NATO ally after a process led by Biden to expand the alliance in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine. To mark the occasion, the first lady is hosting Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson in her box. Trump has repeatedly railed against the NATO alliance as president and as a candidate, saying last month that he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet spending guidelines on defense – a stunning admission he would not abide by the collective-defense clause at the heart of the alliance if reelected.Biden has taken a number of actions to stop the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, which has been the main driver of overdose deaths in the country. Those efforts include a key agreement with China announced last year to crack down on the export of source chemicals and the creation of a Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force aimed at cracking down on illicit financial networks supporting cartels and drug traffickers.Second gentleman Doug Emhoff is bringing Justin Phillips, the founder and CEO of Overdose Lifeline, a non-profit dedicated to reducing the stigma of substance use disorder and preventing deaths resulting from opioid and fentanyl overdose, to Thursday’s address. Phillips lost her son Aaron to a drug overdose and “focuses her advocacy on expanding access to overdose prevention medications” like Narcan, the White House said.As he looks to appeal to moderate voters, Biden is expected to ramp up his efforts to highlight his work to bolster the Affordable Care Act and bring down prescription drug prices, including capping the price of insulin. He will also highlight a 2025 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug costs.The first lady will host Steven Hadfield of Matthews, North Carolina, to emphasize those efforts. Hadfield, the White House said, “has a rare blood cancer and is diabetic—two conditions that require very expensive drugs, including a drug that was selected for the first round of Medicare drug price negotiation.”Biden is also expected to tout a series of legislative accomplishments that are taking shape across the country: the infrastructure law; the CHIPS and Science Act boosting semiconductor production; and the climate, health care and tax package. But that message has struggled to break through as polling indicates voters still aren’t seeing the benefits of these laws.Augusta, Georgia, Mayor Garnett Johnson will be present in the first lady’s box, representing his town’s participation as a “Workforce Hub” aimed at training students in growing sectors. Natalie King, the founder of Dunamis Charge in Detroit, is working to manufacture electric vehicle chargers. Stephen Roe Lewis, governor of the Gila River Indian Community is shaping tribal government infrastructure. And Rashawn Spivey, owner of Hero Plumbing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is among those working to replace the country’s lead pipes to ensure safe drinking water.The past year saw a record number of high-profile strikes, from SAG-AFTRA to the Teamsters. And Biden made history as the first president to join a picket line as he marched with members of the United Auto Workers in Michigan last September, culminating in a new deal between the union and the “Big Three” automakers. Biden has repeatedly called himself the most pro-union president in history.He’ll drive that point home Thursday with UAW president Shawn Fain joining the first lady as a guest. UAW Local 126 member Dawn Simms, who worked at a Belvidere, Illinois, plant that was closed in February 2023 and then reopened in the aftermath of the UAW-Big Three deal, will also be present.And Samantha Ervin-Upsher, an apprentice with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters Local 432 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will be present as Biden looks to highlight career training.There have been 70 mass shootings in the United States so far this year and 2,036 since President Biden took office, according to the Gun Violence Archive.Biden is likely to highlight a series of executive actions on the issue, the creation of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention; the gun safety law passed by Congress; and investments in mental health programs, community violence prevention and school security. But he has repeatedly called on Congress to do more – and will likely renew those calls Thursday night.As he makes that case, Jazmin Cazares of Uvalde, Texas, will be in the first lady’s box. Cazares’ sister, Jackie, was killed at the massacre at Robb Elementary School, and Jazmin has spent the time since “traveling across the country and sharing Jackie’s story,” the White House said.Biden is also expected to champion the country’s military and military families as part of his unity agenda on Thursday evening. He’s previously used his State of the Union addresses to advocate for veterans’ mental health.To highlight these efforts, the White House invited Tiffany Zoeller, a military spouse from Fayetteville, North Carolina. Zoeller introduced the president at Fort Liberty as he announced an executive order aimed at supporting military spouse career stability and employment resources.This year’s State of the Union address falls on the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, a critical moment for the civil rights movement. In 1965, state and local lawmen in Alabama attacked marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge with billy clubs and tear gas, driving them back to Selma. Seventeen people were hospitalized and dozens more were injured by police. Months after the brutality, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law.Biden is hosting Bettie Mae Fikes, “an American singer and civil rights advocate who was a Bloody Sunday Foot Soldier,” the White House said. Fikes joined the president for an anniversary ceremony last year in Selma, per the White House.President Biden, who lost his son Beau Biden to brain cancer in 2015, has made finding cures for cancer one of his signature priorities through the Biden Cancer Moonshot.Jill Biden will host Kris Blackley, an oncology nurse from Fort Mill, South Carolina, who has published research “related to patient navigation showing improved outcomes, including decreased readmissions, increased treatment compliance, and equity in care.” The administration has announced actions to expand access to cancer patient navigation services.The president is also likely to honor first responders during his address Thursday.Kameryn Pupunu of Lahaina, Hawaii, is a Maui police officer who will be a guest of the first lady. Catastrophic wildfires scorched Maui last August, killing more than 100 people.“Pupunu was one of the many local police officers who performed heroic acts, including saving 15 individuals, from this deadly wildfire. Tragically, Pupunu lost four of his immediate family members to these fires,” the White House said."

        "title": "Supreme Court is under pressure to step into the debate over transgender rights",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The Supreme Court is facing intense pressure to step into the charged debate over gender-affirming care as transgender minors and their families fight with GOP states over a wave of laws passed in recent years that restrict such care for young trans people.The high court has largely stayed out of hot-button cases concerning transgender rights, often declining to intervene when litigants appeal to the justices in disputes over everything from school bathroom policies and sports bans to prohibitions on conversion therapy.But a patchwork of lower-court decisions in cases over gender-affirming care may ultimately force the court to wade into the issue for the first time. As things currently stand, the justices are facing four appeals in cases challenging bans on gender-affirming care for minors in three states.The most recent appeal landed at the court last month in the form of an emergency request from officials in Idaho who want the court to permit the state to enforce its ban while a legal challenge to it plays out in a lower court. Both sides have fully briefed their arguments before the court, which could act on the emergency appeal as soon as this week.The other three appeals arrived at the court days apart last November and stem from an appeals court decision last year upholding state bans in Tennessee and Kentucky in challenges to the laws from trans youth and their families, as well as the Biden administration.The justices are set to consider those earlier appeals for the first time during their closed-door conference next week. The trio of petitions could languish for weeks or months if the justices decide to slow-walk their consideration of them.“These laws are punitive, and insofar as the court cares about impacts on people on the ground, these cases make out a very strong argument for taking the case,” said Tobias Barrington Wolff, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who’s an expert on LGBTQ rights.Conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas have appeared eager in the past to take up cases concerning transgender Americans, but they’ll need two of their colleagues to join them to add the cases out of Tennessee and Kentucky to their docket for next term.In the Idaho case, attorneys for the trans teenagers and their parents who are challenging the state law asked the court last week to turn down the request from state Attorney General Raúl Labrador, saying that for both minor plaintiffs, “gender-affirming medical care has dramatically alleviated their gender dysphoria and enabled them to become healthy, thriving teenagers.”Meanwhile, supporters of Idaho’s law have raced to the court in recent weeks to urge the justices to uphold the prohibition.Last month, more than a dozen states and six individuals who regret receiving gender-affirming treatments earlier in their lives asked the justices to lift the block on the prohibitions, with the so-called detransitioners warning that they were “harmed” by the care.“Sadly, [the individuals] learned through their experiences that such interventions did not resolve their mental health issues or gender dysphoria, but only caused physical harm and increased their distress as they realized their bodies had been irreversibly altered based upon a false promise,” the friend-of-the-court brief states.Gender-affirming care is customized to each person’s needs and spans a range of evidence-based treatments and approaches that benefit people who identify as transgender or nonbinary. The types of care vary by the age and the goals of the recipient and are considered the medically necessary standard of care by nearly every mainstream medical association.Studies have found deep satisfaction among adults who also had some form of a surgical procedure as a part of gender-affirming care, which can be transformative for an adult and may even be life-saving. Surgery is not recommended for minors. Lawyers for the challengers to the Idaho law told the court that “treatment regret, due to detransition or other reasons … is extremely rare.”Shannon Minter, the National Center for Lesbian Rights’ legal director and one of the attorneys behind the challenge to Kentucky’s ban, told CNN, “There’s such a clear circuit split now that I think it’s only a matter of time until they do feel compelled to take a case.”“It could be now,” Minter added. “I hope it is because the negative decisions, really, I think cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court’s precedent and these bans are causing terrible harm to these families.”More than 20 states have moved in recent years to restrict gender-affirming care for trans youth, and challenges have been brought against many of them, resulting in conflicting rulings from federal judges and circuit courts across the country.The wave of laws and lawsuits is unlikely to stop.Those circuit splits – rulings that impact part of the country but conflict with rulings from elsewhere in the country – often lead the Supreme Court to step in. But it’s not uncommon for the court to decline to hear an appeal, as was the case earlier this year when the justices decided not to review a lower-court ruling that an Indiana public school’s bathroom policy discriminated against a transgender student.“I don’t think there’s any reason that they have to swoop in and decide this issue immediately, simply because there are some emerging differences among the circuits,” Wolff said, adding that if the justices “continue to be interested in this issue in the same way that they were interested in it in (a key 2020 LGBTQ employment discrimination dispute), then these cases certainly present a vehicle for them to take to take the issue up.”In its decision last September, a divided panel of the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed district court rulings that blocked the gender-affirming care bans in Tennessee and Kentucky.Tennessee’s law says that medical providers in the state cannot perform procedures which “enable a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex” or “treat purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor’s sex and asserted identity.”Kentucky’s ban similarly prohibits health care providers from administering gender-affirming care, including by prescribing puberty blockers and hormone therapy, to most minors.“If the injunction remains in place, Tennessee and Kentucky will suffer harm from their inability to enforce the will of their legislatures, to further the public-health considerations undergirding the laws, and to avoid health risks to their children,” the appeals court said in the 2-1 majority opinion.In pushing health care bans like these, Republicans have argued that decisions around such care should be made after an individual becomes an adult. But as part of their legal challenges, opponents have argued that in addition to violating the civil rights of trans youth, the laws also run afoul of parents’ rights to make decisions about their child’s medical care.Sixth Circuit Judge Helene White acknowledged those concerns in her dissent last year, writing that the two state laws at issue “cannot pass constitutional muster.”“The laws further deprive the parents – those whom we otherwise recognize as best suited to further their minor children’s interests – of their right to make medical decisions affecting their children in conjunction with their children and medical practitioners,” White wrote.In their petitions to the court, the challengers in Tennessee and Kentucky pointed to a 2022 ruling from a different circuit: an 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding a preliminary injunction that blocked Arkansas’ ban on gender-affirming care for trans youth.At the time, that decision represented the only other appeals court ruling in favor of the challenges to such laws. That ruling was never formally wiped away, and a permanent injunction was later issued by the district court. The full circuit is set to review that decision soon.Apart from the 6th Circuit, one other appeals court – the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals – has upheld a ban on gender-affirming care.In a ruling last year, the court allowed Alabama to enforce its ban and the state was able to begin doing so in January. A trial in the case is set for August.Among the nine justices, at least two have shown a desire to take up cases concerning transgender rights: Alito and Thomas.In recent years, both have written publicly to criticize their colleagues’ decision to sidestep cases over issues concerning transgender Americans and the LGBTQ community at large, though none of those cases have centered on gender-affirming care in the way that the Tennessee, Kentucky and Idaho cases do.Last June, when the court declined to review an appeals court ruling in favor of a transgender woman who sued a Virginia men’s prison over alleged mistreatment at the facility, Alito penned a nine-page dissent that was joined by Thomas to air his grievances with the move and the lower-court ruling that was appealed up to the high court.The lower-court ruling, Alito wrote, “will raise a host of important and sensitive questions regarding such matters as participation in women’s and girls’ sports, access to single-sex restrooms and housing, the use of traditional pronouns, and the administration of sex reassignment therapy (both the performance of surgery and the administration of hormones) by physicians and at hospitals that object to such treatment on religious or moral grounds.”“Given that impact … I would grant certiorari now,” Alito said at the time.Months earlier, Alito – again joined by Thomas – argued in a dissent that the court was ignoring “an important issue that this Court is likely to be required to address in the near future” when it declined to let West Virginia enforce an anti-trans sports ban against a young trans student.In that matter, the two justices said they would have allowed the state to enforce the law, which was one of more than a dozen such laws enacted by GOP-led states since 2020.The pair – joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh – also publicly disagreed with the court’s decision last December to let stand a Washington state law prohibiting licensed health care professionals from practicing “conversion therapy,” with Thomas writing in a dissent that the law is “presumptively unconstitutional.”Another member of the court’s conservative wing has been on the minds of some court watchers while the recently appealed cases hang in the balance: Justice Neil Gorsuch, who penned a landmark ruling in the 2020 case Bostock v. Clayton County that said federal civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender workers.In that matter, Gorsuch, handed a surprise win to the progressives when he extended the protections to LGBTQ workers by applying his “textualist” judicial philosophy to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.But even in that case, where Gorsuch’s majority opinion was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, Gorsuch was clear that his ruling was narrowly tailored and took into account how it could impact other areas of concern for employers.“Under Title VII itself, they say sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes will prove unsustainable after our decision today,” he wrote. “But none of these other laws are before us … Under Title VII, too, we do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.”Alito, again in dissent, hit back at that point, describing various areas where he said there could be “potential consequences of the Court’s decision.”Among them was women’s sports and healthcare, with Alito saying healthcare benefits “may emerge as an intense battleground under the Court’s holding.” But this was a year before Arkansas became the first state to enact restrictions on gender-affirming care, which would soon give way to an avalanche of similar laws in the succeeding years.Bostock’s impact is finally before the justices to consider, and Alito and Thomas are ready to pounce. The question is whether their colleagues are willing to join them."

        "title": "Biden projects a vision of strength that’s been missing from his presidency but will be needed in 2024 campaign",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "This version of Joe Biden could beat Donald Trump.At the State of the Union address on Thursday night, the 81-year-old president set out to defuse his biggest liability: deep-seated fears among millions of Americans that he’s too old to serve a second term.There is nothing worse for a president than looking weak. So every word, gesture, joke and admonition of Biden’s appearance was geared toward the goal of making him look strong.And in the most important moment of the 2024 election campaign so far, Biden appeared to succeed. He projected vigor and forcefulness. His voice, which has seemed reedy at times, was sonorant. He was quick off the mark as he goaded heckling Republicans, who again walked into his trap by showcasing their extremism to millions of viewers. Biden was a trenchant master of the chamber of the House of Representatives, effectively wielding the theatrics of the presidency and commanding an hour of unfiltered primetime television.At times, Biden reanimated the scrappy, twinkle-eyed, blue-collar street politician that has characterized his public image for decades — for instance, when he used the word “illegal” instead of the more politically correct term “undocumented migrant.”Taking aim at another of his own weaknesses — over the border crisis — Biden attacked the GOP for sabotaging a bipartisan border bill that contained many of the policies that Republicans had been advocating for years, apparently because Trump wanted to deprive him of an election year win. The president pointed out that many Republicans had originally supported the measure, and he mockingly reacted to their boos by saying: “You don’t think so — you don’t like that bill, huh?”Not for the first time in the speech, Biden appeared to be speaking directly to Trump, potentially watching at home in Florida, while trying to get under his skin. “If my predecessor is watching, instead of playing politics to pressure members of Congress to block the bill, join me in telling the Congress to pass it. We can do it together.”And Biden slammed Republicans for forgetting the trauma of the January 6, 2021, mob attack on the US Capitol by the former president’s supporters. “My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth of January 6. I will not do that,” Biden said. “Remember your oath of office — to defend against all threats foreign and domestic.” The president’s intention appeared to be to remind voters of the extremes of the Trump years at a time when polls suggest growing nostalgia for his presidency among some voters.Such an energetic performance from Biden has been in far less evidence as he’s perceptibly aged and been weighed down by the burdens of office. If he is to overcome the kind of low approval ratings that typically doom first-term presidents, he will have to emulate this performance over and over in the coming months.It is unusual for a president to spend so much time calling out his electoral opponent in an annual address. Biden repeatedly took shots at Trump – whom he referred to only as “my predecessor.” In that sense, this year’s State of the Union represented one of the most overt examples of a president delivering a campaign-style speech from the podium in the House, as Democrats chanted “four more years.”Trump has for years lampooned Biden as old, tired, doddering and weak, often with cruel impersonations at his campaign rallies. Any misstep or senior moment from the president on Thursday night would have immediately gone viral and had the damaging effect of confirming what majorities in polls think — that Biden is too old to be running for reelection.Alabama Sen. Katie Britt may have hoped for a less robust performance by the president since her Republican response to his speech included the pre-written line, “Right now, our commander in chief is not in command. The free world deserves better than a dithering and diminished leader.”House Speaker Mike Johnson took a similar approach as he accused Biden of behaving in a hyperpartisan manner.“President Biden is clearly not on his A-game and I think that’s a charitable way to describe it. I thought tonight he was overly emotional. I thought he shouted at the audience. I thought so much of that was unnecessary,” Johnson said.Of course, Republicans would have faulted any version of Biden that showed up on Thursday. Had he lacked energy, they’d have said he was too old. Since he put on a strong performance, they accused him of shouting.Not only did the president seek to project strength, he also sought to redefine the concept of strong leadership in his favor. He suggested that while Trump projects a strongman’s persona, he’s really most interested in genuflecting to dictators and autocrats.Biden started his speech with a strident demand for the House to lift its hold on his $60 billion arms package for Ukraine, which Trump opposes, portraying it as vital to continued American strength in the world.He contrasted Trump with former Republican President Ronald Reagan’s thundering call on Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down” the Berlin Wall. “My predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin, quote, ‘Do whatever the Hell you want,’” Biden said, drawing boos from Democrats on the House floor. “That’s a quote. A former president actually said that bowing down to a Russian leader. I think it’s outrageous, it’s dangerous and it’s unacceptable.”“We will not bow down. I will not bow down,” Biden said. “History is watching.” Biden also accused Trump of going soft on President Xi Jinping’s China, saying he had taken steps to bolster regional alliances to meet its threat and to protect US technology from being used in the country. “For all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that.”While Biden was hale and lively in delivering his speech, it’s tough to know in the moment how it will affect voters agonizing over their vote and even wavering Democrats whom the president badly needs to show up in large numbers in November. And his political position is so perilous that no one speech can guarantee his reelection. The months to come will have multiple unpredictable events that could sway the result.Some Republicans faulted the president’s delivery and said he mistook loudness for strength. Former President George W. Bush’s ex-spokesman Ari Fleischer mused on X, for instance, that someone had told Biden to show energy but that he instead came across as “weirdly amped up” and was “bizarrely fast” in his delivery.Other Republicans complained that Biden had polarized a great state occasion. “Maybe that was supposed to be the Democratic Convention speech,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas told CNN. “It was divisive. It was an attack ad against Republicans.”The president’s use of the annual speech to the nation to repeatedly attack his 2024 opponent, if not by name, was indeed a political risk in that it could have offended some swing voters. But it also made the most of what may be Biden’s most potent political platform of the year.And it’s rich for Republicans to complain about politicizing the State of the Union. Trump presented the Medal of Freedom to late conservative radio icon Rush Limbaugh one year. And he used the White House, which belongs to all Americans regardless of political party, as the backdrop for his Republican National Convention speech in the pandemic year of 2020.The profound national crossroads that the 2024 election represents – between Biden’s traditional, American global leadership and Trump’s populist “America First” nationalism – has rarely come across as stark as Biden laid it out during his opening remarks on Ukraine. On Friday, Trump is set to welcome a European autocrat, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, to his resort at Mar-a-Lago. Orban’s suppression of democracy, opposition figures, the legal system and the press looks a lot like the second term of “retribution” that Trump is promising. Like Trump, Orban cozies up to Putin and backs the ex-president’s plan to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours — a process that could only happen on the Russian leader’s terms and reward his illegal invasion of a democracy. Orban is the kind of idealized strongman that Trump would like to become and frequently cites at his rallies.In his speech on Thursday, however, Biden was advocating a different kind of strength – one rooted in democracy rather than in trying to destroy it.In summing up his remarks, Biden sought to make his age a virtue rather than a liability, arguing that Trump is a creature of a dangerous past, while he has a positive vision of the future.“I know I may not look like it, but I’ve been around a while,” the president quipped. “When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever. I know the American story. Again and again. I’ve seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our nation.”“Let’s build a future together and let’s remember who we are,” Biden said.That debate about two vastly different visions of the meaning and the soul of the country will decide the fates of both Biden and Trump come November."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "A defining week in politics will clarify the choice Americans will face in November in a fateful and unprecedented election that is already testing long-held interpretations of the Constitution and the powers of the presidency.The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a push in Colorado to throw ex-President Donald Trump off the ballot because of the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists.Trump is meanwhile expected to emerge from the 15-state Super Tuesday GOP primaries within touching distance of a third straight Republican nomination. As he seeks a stunning White House return four years after trying to overturn the last election, the ex-president is showing a new term would be even more extreme than his first.President Joe Biden, meanwhile, will take the stage before a huge television audience two nights later for his State of the Union address. It’s a critical test for an 81-year-old commander in chief facing deep doubts that he’s fit to serve a second term as he’s beset by global crises and disappointment with his performance at home.A race between the current president and the ex-president is one that polls show many Americans dread. But Trump and Biden’s turns in the spotlight this week will highlight their all-but-certain rematch, barring health crises or other surprise events. Biden is highly vulnerable in a race that has no clear leader, according to the CNN Poll of Polls average.November’s election is already heaping pressure on political and electoral institutions, the Constitution and America’s fragile national unity. The country has never had an election in which one candidate faces multiple criminal trials and is running on the false premise that he was illegally ousted from power.Following Monday’s Supreme Court decision in the Colorado case, Trump’s name will appear on ballots that were printed weeks ago. Without a ruling from the justices, there was no guarantee voters who pick Trump would have their choice counted if justices decided he was ineligible to serve.The Supreme Court last week agreed to hear another massive case, over Trump’s claims of sweeping presidential immunity, which he’s made in response to his indictment for attempting to steal the 2020 election. The move further delayed the ex-president’s federal criminal trial over election interference, which Trump – who is seeking to push off his trials past the 2024 election – touted as a win.Both cases pose enormous questions about the legal foundation of the electoral system and whether presidents are truly subject to the same laws as other citizens.Four years ago, the Super Tuesday Democratic primaries saw Biden pull off a staggering political comeback, routing his rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and taking a decisive hold on the Democratic nomination. This year’s edition will likely prove similarly decisive for Trump, who is aiming for a sweep of big states to build on his cruise through early state contests and hopes to finally crush his last-remaining rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. A third nomination for Trump would represent an extraordinary comeback after he left office in disgrace two weeks after a mob of his supporters smashed their way into the US Capitol in an attempt to thwart certification of Biden’s election win.Ahead of a likely general election clash, Trump’s appetite for testing the rule of law and the Constitution is undimmed. He is promising a presidency of “retribution” against his political enemies in a campaign pulsating with some of the most venomous anti-immigrant and autocratic rhetoric in modern US history.Biden’s appearance in the House of Representatives on Thursday night, therefore, will not just mark a vital opportunity to court a primetime audience and to cultivate buzz that will reach many more viewers on social media. It will personify the implicit narrative of his campaign: that while voters may worry about the oldest president in history in a second term that would end when he’s 86, he’s the final bulwark between a second Trump presidency, which he warns could trash democracy.The former president’s march toward the Republican nomination accelerated over the weekend with his victories in the Idaho and Missouri caucuses and after he locked up all Michigan’s delegates to go with his thumping win in the state’s primary last week.The GOP front-runner will not be able to reach the 1,215 delegates he needs to win the nomination on Tuesday night, but his expected victories in a run of states with 865 delegates at stake will make him the presumptive GOP nominee in all but name. According to CNN’s latest calculations, Trump has 247 delegates compared with Haley’s 43. She scored her first victory Sunday night when she won the GOP primary in Washington, DC.Trump’s dominance of the GOP primary race has enabled him to consolidate the congressional leaders of the party around him. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican leader in the Senate, endorsed him last week. And last week’s announcement from Mitch McConnell that he’ll soon step down as Senate GOP leader underscored the ex-president’s populist, nationalist transformation of a party once rooted in fiscal conservatism and globalism.Haley, stung by the loss of her own state primary in South Carolina last month, vowed Sunday to “keep fighting” because “70% of Americans say they don’t want Donald Trump or Joe Biden.” But there will be increasing pressure on her to bow out of the race if her opponent blows her out of the water Tuesday.“At some point, you have got to call it,” GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday. “I thought she would call it after she lost her own state in a horrible fashion. Now that we go into Super Tuesday, there’s not a chance she’s going to win a single state.”As Trump consolidates his power within the GOP, his rhetoric is becoming even wilder, in a campaign that is now inseparable from his defense in his multiple criminal trials. The ex-president, posing as a political “dissident,” falsely styles his daunting bill of hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution after several lost civil cases as proof of a campaign of political persecution by the Biden administration.On Saturday, Trump characteristically projected onto Biden the exact offense of which he is accused in several criminal cases, underscoring the threat the ex-president would pose to democratic institutions if he won back the White House.He told supporters in Greensboro, North Carolina, that Biden’s conduct amid a southern border crisis was tantamount to “a conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America.” He said: “Biden and his accomplices want to collapse the American system, nullify the will of the actual American voters and establish a new base power that gives them control for generations.”Trump’s comments reflect the vital importance of his case before the Supreme Court on his claim of almost blanket presidential immunity. The case is important not just in relation to his interference in the 2020 election; it points to his aspirations for unfettered political power if he wins in November.As his likely contest with Trump looms, Biden heads into the State of the Union address under enormous pressure to cut a vigorous and optimistic figure. He needs to show he’s a president in command and can transmit a vision for the future.A new round of polls released over the weekend underscored Biden’s challenges. The surveys portray a nation that most voters feel is headed in the wrong direction as they wait to feel economic benefits that official data show – and the White House insists – is a strong recovery. Biden looks vulnerable in these surveys on his management of the economy, inflation, the southern US border, the war in Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas.But the most striking aspect of the new surveys by The New York Times/Siena College and The Wall Street Journal lies in the profound concerns many voters have about the president’s age and his capacity. A majority of voters who backed Biden in 2020 now say he’s too old to serve effectively as president, according to the Times poll. There are fewer concerns about the 77-year-old Trump’s capacity. In the Wall Street Journal survey, 73% of respondents said Biden was too old to run for reelection. Some 52% thought the same of Trump.The president has in recent weeks tried to deflect such concerns by joking about his age. And last week, he was certified as fit to serve by his medical team after his annual physical examination. Biden has also spent recent weeks seeking to shore up key elements of his coalition, including union workers and minority and younger voters. And Democrats plan to jam Republicans over hardline abortion restrictions backed by Republican state legislatures and conservative judges in the wake of the overturning of the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion by the Supreme Court.But the new polling suggests the president’s efforts have done little to dismantle one of his biggest obstacles to reelection – his age. That’s why his State of the Union address is shaping up to be one of the most important such speeches this century.The appearance will come at a fraught moment. Another end-of-the-week deadline is looming to avert a government shutdown. While leaders of both congressional chambers have reached a bipartisan spending deal, the tiny GOP House majority means any piece of legislation is a heavy lift. Biden is, meanwhile, under pressure as he pushes for a long-term pause in the fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. Last week’s Michigan primary showed how anger among Arab American and progressive voters over his handling of the war could threaten his prospects in a vital general election swing state. Biden is also demanding House Speaker Mike Johnson put a foreign aid bill on the floor that would send $60 billion in weapons and other aid to Ukraine.Last year, Biden’s annual address was something of a triumph, as he shut down Republicans who heckled him and laid a trap for them as Democrats sought to portray the House majority as extreme. The president positioned himself as the last line of defense against the excesses of what he has called “ultra MAGA” Republicans. This is still the cornerstone of his reelection strategy.This year, the visual impression that the oldest president in history sends about his vigor and mental acuity may be as important as anything he actually says."

        "title": "Dean Phillips denies his candidacy weakened Biden",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, who ended his long-shot Democratic primary challenge to President Joe Biden this week, denied Thursday that his campaign had weakened Biden politically.“I think, to the contrary, I think he did so well in the Democratic primaries that I think he looks awfully strong,” Phillips told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” when asked whether he was worried he had.On the campaign trail, the Minnesota Democrat questioned Biden’s ability to win in November and serve out a second term. But on Wednesday, he exited the presidential race and endorsed Biden, who has dominated nearly every Democratic nominating contest so far this year.Phillips told Tapper that his job is to now convince the large portion of Americans who share his concerns about Biden that they need to support his reelection, or else face what he argued was the threat posed by presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.“I think 86% of the country, Jake, has said that [Biden is too old], but there’s something a whole lot more important,” he said, adding that it’s “better to take a chance” with Biden “because he’s a good man, a decent man, a man of principle, experience and wisdom, compared to the alternative.”An ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted last month found that 86% of Americans think Biden is too old to serve another term as president.Phillips denied Thursday that he had ever challenged Biden’s mental acuity or cognition, though he said he still thinks the president is “very compromised” electorally, pointing to general election polling that shows Biden trailing Trump.“He is not in cognitive decline. Yes, he’s an 81-year-old man. Like any of us, he’s going to slow down,” Phillips said, adding that Biden is still able to make good decisions and “that’s what matters.”On the campaign trail, Phillips took direct aim at the president’s age, expressing several times that he was “actuarially” in decline. In an interview with a Minnesota radio host Wednesday in which he announced he was ending his campaign, Phillips said Biden was “at a stage in life where his capacities are diminished.”But he said Wednesday it was his mission to convince Biden skeptics to make the same calculation he did.“I’m telling the same people in the same place, thinking the same thing that, ‘Look, we’ve got to get out and vote. We’ve got to mobilize. We’ve got to energize. I’m one of you.’ And sometimes a campaign actually needs someone like me to represent the mass majority of people who see things a little bit differently,” he said.Following Phillips’ exit from the presidential race, Biden thanked the congressman on social media for his “kind words” and welcomed him to the team, saying, “We need you with us.”Looking ahead to Biden’s State of the Union address Thursday, Phillips said he hopes to see “vigor” from the president, as well as policy proposals to deal with the “cost issues” and “chaos issues” concerning Americans.“If the president can lay out what the problems are, demonstrate that he’s listening to people, and most importantly, solutions, he can be very well positioned for the next election,” he said.An heir to a Minnesota distilling business and former chairman of Talenti Gelato, Phillips announced last fall that he would not seek a fourth term this year to his Minneapolis-area seat.He told Tapper he was met with “hugs and handshakes and high fives” Thursday from his Democratic colleagues on Capitol Hill, many of whom had been privately and publicly critical of his campaign.“At the end of the day, we are on the same team, and every single American watching this right now … can see the stark choice we have ahead of us,” he said.Pressed by Tapper to respond to some Democrats who had said he was narcissistic for challenging Biden, Phillips responded: “If someone thinks this was a selfish endeavor, let me tell you, this is not the way to accomplish an ego trip.”He acknowledged that he had “burned bridges” in Washington but accused those who criticized him of being out of touch with the rest of the country.“Everyone I spoke to in this country – Democrats, Republicans, independents, Libertarians – all said the same thing. How is it possible we find ourselves in this position and why is nobody on my side of the aisle saying what we’re all thinking?” he said.Phillips struggled during his brief campaign to get his message across as he accused Democrats of working to suppress his candidacy. On the trail, besides criticizing Biden over his age, the congressman also shifted left on several policy issues.But he didn’t come close to winning a single Democratic nominating contest. Even in his home state of Minnesota on Super Tuesday, an effort to vote “uncommitted” finished ahead of him."

        "title": "Biden’s allies are begging him to fight harder. The State of the Union is his chance to do so.",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "A handful of Democratic governors made their way through a gaggle of their colleagues last month to tell President Joe Biden directly what they’ve been stressing behind the scenes: He needs to be fighting harder.The Democrats told Biden that he needed to show more of the fire that was on display in a closed-door meeting with governors when Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte handed him a letter demanding more action on the southern border. Biden flashed a smile, according to two of the governors standing there.“State of the Union,” Biden said, teasingly.That fighting attitude is anticipated to be on display during Thursday’s primetime speech, in which the president is expected to go much further than he is used to in bashing corporations for gouging consumers and racking up profits. But with anger about rising prices driving so much of the bad vibes surrounding the economy — even the Cookie Monster X account posted about shrinkflation on Monday, prompting a response from the White House — Biden is going where he long resisted, in an effort to redirect the fury that has been weighing him down in the polls.Leading Democrats say it’s far past time.Two dozen top Democratic officials and operatives who spoke to CNN said they’re tired of reading that the president is cursing about Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu behind the closed doors of the Oval Office, or hearing reports that he told donors that Vladimir Putin is “a crazy SOB” and that MAGA Republicans are worse than segregationists. They want to see that passion and fire out in public as assurances that the president’s behind-the-scenes demeanor doesn’t match the public perception of the 81-year-old commander-in-chief are wearing thin.“A lot of times you need to hear it from the candidate,” said Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota who’s eagerly thrown himself into becoming one of the president’s most active defenders. “Joe Biden’s a nice guy. People get that. One of the things people wonder, ‘Is he tough enough to take these things on?’”Plus, Walz said, it would push back against the concerns that Biden is too old.“I think it helps. He’s still going to be his age, but I think it helps to make the case on this,” Walz said. “Punch [Trump] a little bit. He earned it.”Multiple Democratic officials told CNN they are hesitant of how much of to say, weighing the risks of calling even more attention to what Biden isn’t doing by going public.But privately, many talk longingly about wanting to see more passion and pride – political theatrics, sure, but ones that they argue are crucial – at a moment when exhaustion with the process is pervasive and the Democratic worries over a second Trump administration are high. Biden’s effort in standing up for democracy shouldn’t top out with a few sly digs on Seth Meyers’ late-night show, they insist. They argue he shouldn’t give a forceful speech marking the anniversary of the January 6, 2021, insurrection and assume that will fill out his energetic quota for over two months.“People do want to see that he’s a fighter, which he is. Anything that presents the contrast, which I think that would help do, I’d be for,” said New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a longtime friend of Biden.At a moment when polls show majorities of Democrats don’t think Biden should be running for reelection, and with the biggest national audience he is likely to get outside of the summer convention, Biden and his aides are hyper aware of the importance of Thursday’s speech. They know every word and stutter and shuffle will be picked over as much as any of the policy proposals, and the drafting has been going until late into the evening in the West Wing.Top Biden advisers insist that their favorite moment from last year’s speech – when he got Republicans to boo cutting Social Security and Medicare, punctuating the moment with “I enjoy conversion” – was not at all planned.This time around, aides acknowledge that the political pressure has them workshopping options to not leave Biden’s fate up to another improvisation and the hope that he will have another smooth off-the-cuff response.Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz isn’t sure the State of the Union is the right forum for Biden to come out in full force, “but after that, I think he’s going to have to be gloves off.”Biden aides love to scold and shame reporters for coverage they think is unfair or over-torqued. Schatz said the president and his aides need to move past that to get negative stories about Trump covered by getting Biden to take the swings.“We don’t have time to rewrite the rules of engagement in journalism. We just have to work with what we have,” Schatz said. “He’s personally going to have to make that case, and not assume that people are organically going to get it, either from surrogates or via osmosis.”For months, Biden campaign aides have been talking about the need to step up, and the obvious benefit they see in him doing it. People look strong when they’re picking fights, is how one senior Biden campaign official summarized the thinking to CNN all the way back in January – and they know the president needs to look stronger than he does.They have found this easier said than done, and not just because Biden is trying to maintain the chances of getting a few outstanding bills through Congress, including avoiding a shutdown and sending more aid to Israel and Ukraine.“The real Joe Biden is: ‘We’re red states, we’re blue states, but we’re the United States of America,’” said Gov. John Carney, who’s known Biden for decades and attributes that sensibility to their shared Delaware roots. “But he also is feisty.”And while Biden has enjoyed needling Trump while knowing he’ll probably get a response, his inclination is to present a calm demeanor for the sake of trying to insert more civility into politics – like the laudatory statement about Sen. Mitch McConnell he pushed to release last week after the Kentucky Republican announced he would be stepping down as minority leader. Biden did rile up many core Democrats by putting out any statement praising McConnell and by not mentioning things like his role in overturning Roe v. Wade by ensuring that Antonin Scalia’s and Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Supreme Court seats went to conservatives.“A statement like that, you have to wonder if Joe Biden gets it,” one enraged high-level Democratic operative complained to CNN.Most of the fiercest statements to come out of Biden’s campaign so far have been attributed to staff members or written largely by others in his name. Aides say realistic management of the president’s time is a basic consideration: busy running the country, he cannot be constantly running to microphones to blast Trump.“President Biden is on offense, demonstrating whose side he’s on and calling Republican officials out for choosing rich special interests over middle class families, choosing extreme attacks on basic reproductive health care over Americans’ freedoms, and choosing fentanyl traffickers over the Border Patrol by opposing the toughest bipartisan border security legislation in modern history,” said White House spokesman Andrew Bates.Biden campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt followed up with a statement noting similar points and that “the president and vice president will absolutely continue holding Donald Trump accountable and communicating directly to voters how much is at stake in this election.”But on several issues with huge potential for wavering voters, Biden can’t say much at all.Trump’s kaleidoscope of indictments and court cases is one of the former president’s greatest political liabilities and a popular line of attack from Nikki Haley. But Biden is committed to making clear the independence of the Justice Department and courts.He has more to say about Netanyahu and the situation in Gaza that American voters might be interested in, but White House aides are wary of how scrupulously every word attributed to the president is being read both by the Israeli government and Arab leaders in the region.Biden’s habit of pulling back the curtain on these thoughts and others at fundraisers isn’t just because he gets comfortable in front of a friendly crowd. It’s an occasionally tactical decision to try to get his comments into the media bloodstream while preserving a sliver of plausible distance.Just because going harder lights up Democrats already obsessing about the race and plays well online doesn’t mean it’s the best strategy for winning over the moderates and Republicans turned off by Trump that Biden is hoping to be a palatable enough alternative for, especially over a long campaign that can already feel like a slog with still eight months to go.For now, the campaign has been leaning on a format for videos for its new TikTok and other social media accounts: Hand Biden an iPad and record him watching and reacting to a video of the latest Trump comment that the campaign wants to highlight. It’s what one campaign aide called “the real digital equivalent of ‘Let Biden be Biden.’” Biden’s mostly exasperated reactions from watching the videos tend to be fresh, but the comments he makes after to sum them up are scripted and modulated.And for all the people complaining that Biden can seem like an elderly man sleepwalking on the job, aides feel like they have plenty of time to ratchet up the outrage.That only goes so far.“You can’t be at an 11 out of 10 in terms of being alarmed for eight months in a row – so I understand the need for him to peak at the right time, and to make those arguments when the maximum number of voters are paying attention.” Schatz said. “But a lot of times politicians are advised not to be too rough, because it can harm, it can backfire, because it can backfire. In this case, people really know what they think of Joe Biden as a human. So, he’s got a lot of runway here to be as tough as necessary.”"

In many of them, Haley could get locked out of delegates entirely if she can’t beat Trump at either the statewide or congressional district level.Haley’s delegate path is full of obstacles unless she can start winning primaries."

        "title": "Trump faces a fractured party, legal troubles and financial headwinds after securing GOP nomination",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Twelve hours after Donald Trump predicted his near sweep of Super Tuesday states would lead to unity “very quickly” in the Republican Party, the former president delivered a parting shot to his last remaining rival for the GOP nomination. On his social media site Truth Social, he called some of Nikki Haley’s supporters “radical left Democrats” and dismissed her Vermont victory the day before as less than legitimate.“I hope she stays in the ‘race’ and fights it out until the end!” he added.But by then, the former South Carolina governor was no longer in the race. A minute prior, Haley had suspended her presidential campaign, making Trump the presumptive Republican nominee on his way to a rematch with President Joe Biden.As he emerges victorious from the Republican primary race, Trump faces considerable challenges both inside and outside the political arena. He is fighting to delay four criminal trials until after the November election, a battle that is headed to the US Supreme Court next month. Mounting legal bills and more than half a billion dollars in judgments against him have threatened his personal and campaign finances.But chief among his priorities as a candidate over the next eight months will be rallying disenchanted Republicans around his third White House bid. Trump’s team is keenly aware of how polarizing their candidate is, and that every vote will count in what is expected to be a highly competitive general election rematch. Wednesday’s inauspicious start to Trump’s outreach efforts is reflective of the longstanding concerns about his temperament and style that inspired many Republicans to support Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other candidates over the former president.Haley in her concession speech withheld an endorsement and instead encouraged Trump to “earn the vote” of those who supported her.“This is now his time for choosing,” Haley said.In cruising to his party’s nomination, Trump left little doubt that he remains the dominant figure in the GOP. Keeping to a remarkably light campaign schedule throughout much of 2023, Trump vanquished with relative ease a field that included his former vice president (Mike Pence), his first ambassador to the United Nations (Haley), a one-time protégé (DeSantis), a top congressional ally (Tim Scott) and the man who spearheaded his first presidential transition team (Chris Christie), among others. The historically swift primary race delivered an outcome that appeared inevitable since Trump seized control of the lead last summer.With the outcome all-but certain, Trump largely pivoted to the general election weeks ago. Mentions of Haley at rallies and on social media have grown increasingly rare as he instead focused on Biden and the issues he intends to build his campaign around, namely immigration. On Wednesday, Trump challenged Biden to debate “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE.”Meanwhile, sewing up the nomination by early March gives Trump access to the Republican National Committee’s voluminous data on its voters far sooner than his 2016 campaign, as well as its fundraising infrastructure and ground operation. These resources are critical to Trump’s campaign as they make plans to build out their teams in key battleground states like Michigan, Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania in the coming weeks and months.The full support of the RNC – which after this week is likely to include leaders Trump selected, including his daughter-in-law Lara Trump as co-chair – also ensures that Republican parties in each state will begin working immediately toward the goal of electing Trump.The RNC helped pay Trump’s legal fees after he left office but stopped when Trump announced his candidacy in 2022. While Trump’s legal expenses have amassed, the former president’s senior advisers insist they do not plan to tap into the committee’s coffers to help cover Trump’s mounting legal bills.Meanwhile, some deep-pocketed donors who have been wary of having their names linked to Trump, could be more willing to write a check to the RNC, a former RNC official told CNN.Even as Trump looked ahead to a November rematch with Biden, GOP nominating contests continued to demonstrate that Republican support for him is not nearly as ubiquitous as his dominating record would suggest. From Iowa and New Hampshire through Super Tuesday, Haley especially exposed persistent divisions in the party and headwinds for Trump recapturing moderate support.In North Carolina – a key battleground Trump twice narrowly won that President Joe Biden is targeting – 85% of Haley’s voters don’t believe Trump is mentally fit to serve, according to CNN exit polls. Meanwhile, nearly three in 10 of all primary voters said Trump wouldn’t be fit for the presidency if he is convicted of a crime.And in Virginia, where Trump hopes to mount a competitive challenge, three-quarters of Haley’s supporters aren’t committed to voting for Trump in November.One of those voters, Doug Moran, who referred to himself as “a recovering Republican,” said he was “a diehard Republican until Trump took over the party.” After voting for Haley on Tuesday, he said he would “hold my nose and vote for Biden” in a potential rematch of the 2020 election.“I have moral objections to, moral and political objections, to the way Donald Trump ran his campaign and served in office. Some of the choices he’s made I think are just wrong for our country,” Moran said.In recent conversations with more than a dozen Haley voters in primary states, many of them shared similar struggles and voiced uncertainty – or outright refusal – to back Trump should he become the GOP nominee.“My conscience won’t allow me to vote for a criminal,” Jack Wolber, a Republican from Nashua, New Hampshire, told CNN shortly after voting in the state’s January primary.Biden extended an olive branch to Haley’s supporters shortly after she suspended her campaign, saying in a statement, “there is a place for them in my campaign.”“Donald Trump made it clear he doesn’t want Nikki Haley’s supporters,” the statement said.Still, there were other signs of the GOP coalescing around Trump. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a notable holdout and consistent critic of the former president, endorsed Trump shortly after Haley dropped out, a move that Sen. Lindsey Graham called “good for the party.”Trump’s eagerness to move on from the primary in recent weeks is driven in part by internal recognition of the uphill climb he faces in convincing these Republicans, according to conversations with several advisers. His team watched Haley perform well with suburban voters on Super Tuesday and acknowledge the work they have ahead courting moderate and independent voters.“Nothing is a sure thing this time around,” one senior Trump adviser told CNN.They are in the process of identifying areas of weakness for the former president and hope to draw from some of the recent primary data to help shape their strategy ahead of November. Part of that focus will include peeling off voters from traditional Democratic strongholds. In recent months, Trump has made appealing to union households a key part of his strategy for winning over working-class voters, especially in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania—courting the Teamsters union, visiting a nonunion shop outside Detroit during the autoworker strike and railing against Biden’s electric vehicle push.This week, a Trump-aligned super PAC, MAGA, Inc, launched a three-week radio ad campaign targeting Black voters in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Trump’s campaign also sees an opening with Jewish American voters turned off by Biden’s approach to Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, a senior adviser told CNN.Just as they did in the Iowa caucuses, Trump’s campaign is also identifying potential first-time voters, advisers previously told CNN, an acknowledgement that some moderate voters and former Republicans can’t be won over.However, these largely remain broad goals and specific plans have yet to reveal themselves.Some longtime Republican donors also need convincing. North Carolina Republican donor Art Pope, who had been a major supporter of Haley’s presidential ambitions, said Wednesday he’s likely to focus on competitive contests for Congress and positions in his home state in the short-term, but he did not rule out backing Trump’s campaign.“I have never been a Never Trumper,” said Pope, who oversees the Variety Wholesalers discount chain. But he said his financial support would depend on the former President’s vice-presidential choice and the “tone of his campaign” moving forward.“It really depends on him reaching out to traditional conservatives and respecting our positions on the issues,” Pope said.Similarly, Texas businessman Roy Bailey, a one-time Trump backer who shifted support this cycle to DeSantis, said he will “see what the entire landscape looks” before deciding whether to fundraise for the former president once more.With Trump’s team deeply concerned about his finances, the former president spent last weekend hosting potential donors at Mar-a-Lago. He also met recently with Elon Musk, though the billionaire wrote on his social media platform X on Wednesday that he’s “not donating money to either candidate for US President.”Trump’s courtship of these donors come as his campaign is confronting the financial reality of having to pay for the former president’s enormous legal expenses while simultaneously building out a general election campaign strong enough to take on an incumbent president.Additionally, Trump’s political operation is trailing the Biden campaign significantly in the money game, entering February with roughly $30 million in cash reserves compared to nearly $56 million in Biden’s equivalent account.The Democratic National Committee has similarly trounced the Republican National Committee in fundraising.Still, some of Trump’s backers believe Haley’s departure and his quick pivot to the general election gives the former president a much earlier starting point to change minds than he had in his first campaign eight years ago.“I expect this will be another 2016 moment where these disparate folks (who had backed other contenders) come together to support Trump,” said a Republican strategist who is close to a key outside organization in the GOP orbit.“Now, you’ve got eight months to make the case,” the person said of Trump clinching the nomination this week. “That’s something you can’t buy.”"

        "title": "Exclusive: Key figure in fake electors plot concealed damning posts on secret Twitter account from investigators",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Kenneth Chesebro, the right-wing attorney who helped devise the Trump campaign’s fake electors plot in 2020, concealed a secret Twitter account from Michigan prosecutors, hiding dozens of damning posts that undercut his statements to investigators about his role in the election subversion scheme, a CNN KFile investigation has found.Chesebro denied using Twitter, now known as the platform X, or having any “alternate IDs” when directly asked by Michigan investigators last year during his cooperation session, according to recordings of his interview obtained by CNN.But CNN linked Chesebro to the secret account based on numerous matching details — including biographical information regarding his work, family, travels and investments. The anonymous account, BadgerPundit, also showed a keen interest in the Electoral College process and lined up with Chesebro’s private activities at the time.The Twitter posts reveal that even before the 2020 election, and then just two days after polls closed, Chesebro promoted a far more aggressive election subversion strategy than he later let on in his Michigan interview.Chesebro’s lawyers confirmed to CNN that the BadgerPundit account belonged to Chesebro, describing it as his “random stream of consciousness” where he was “spitballing” theories about the election – but insisted that it was separate from his legal work for Trump’s campaign.“When he was doing volunteer work for the campaign, he was very specific and hunkered-down into being the lawyer that he is, and gave specific kinds of legal advice based on things that he thought were legitimate legal challenges, versus BadgerPundit, who is this other guy over there, just being a goof,” said Robert Langford, an attorney for Chesebro.Chesebro has not been charged with any crimes in Michigan and sat for an hourslong interview with the state attorney general’s office in early December. In his retelling to Michigan prosecutors, Chesebro has cast himself as a moderate middleman who was duped by Trump’s more radical lawyers.Asked about the secret tweets, Danny Wimmer, a spokesman for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, said in a statement to CNN, “Our team is interested in the material and will be looking into this matter.”Chesebro claimed to investigators he saw the alternate slates of Republican electors only as a contingency plan to have ready in case the Trump campaign won any of its more than 60 lawsuits challenging the election results — which it didn’t. He also told Michigan investigators that in his conversations with the Trump campaign, he made clear that “state legislatures have no power to override the courts.”But just days after the 2020 election, BadgerPundit tweeted that the court battles didn’t matter and that Republican-controlled legislatures should send in their own GOP electors, predicting even then that then-Vice President Mike Pence could use them to throw the election to Trump.“You don’t get the big picture. Trump doesn’t have to get courts to declare him the winner of the vote. He just needs to convince Republican legislatures that the election was systematically rigged, but it’s impossible to run it again, so they should appoint electors instead,” wrote BadgerPundit on November 7, 2020, the day multiple media outlets, including CNN, called the election for Joe Biden.Yet in his interview with Michigan investigators, Chesebro said the very opposite, claiming that the entire electors plan was contingent on the courts.“I saw no scenario where Pence could count any vote for any state because there hadn’t been a court or a legislature in any state backing any of the alternate electors,” Chesebro said.After the 2020 election, BadgerPundit tweeted more than 50 times that Pence had the power to count the electors benefitting Trump, according to a CNN KFile analysis of the account.Chesebro also told investigators that he felt “misled” by the Trump campaign for concealing the entirety of their plan from him. He claimed that it wasn’t until last year that he fully realized the campaign had always intended to deploy the fake electors regardless of the outcome of its election lawsuits.That idea was first raised in a September 2020 article in The Atlantic, which quoted a “Trump legal adviser” who described using alternate electors to overturn a Trump loss.When asked by Michigan investigators if he had knowledge of The Atlantic article at the time it was published, Chesebro said he did not. Yet BadgerPundit tweeted about it the same day it was published and defended the plot.Chesebro’s attorneys acknowledged in an interview with CNN that “there’s clearly a conflict” between some of his tweets and what he told Michigan prosecutors, and that some of the elector theories he embraced online were “inconsistent” with his subsequent legal advice to the Trump campaign.Some of Chesebro’s anonymous tweets were previously reported by Talking Points Memo. The BadgerPundit account went private sometime in late 2022, but CNN was able to access the since-removed public tweets by using the Wayback Machine, an internet archive.The fake electors plot features prominently in special counsel Jack Smith’s federal election subversion indictment against Trump, who has pleaded not guilty. Chesebro has been identified by CNN as an unindicted co-conspirator in that case.Chesebro was indicted alongside Trump in a separate 2020 election interference case in Georgia. He struck a plea deal there in October, agreeing to plead guilty to one felony count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. He gave proffer interviews to Georgia prosecutors as part of the cooperation agreement, though it’s unclear if he was asked about his social media accounts.Michigan investigators secured Chesebro’s cooperation in December, after previously charging the 16 fake electors in that state with multiple felonies. Chesebro has additionally met with investigators in Wisconsin and Arizona who are probing their fake electors, and he avoided charges in Nevada after cooperating with prosecutors there.If Chesebro intentionally misled investigators, he could face legal jeopardy.“Chesebro appears to have pursued a legally perilous path in his dealings with Michigan authorities,” said Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University, who reviewed the posts for CNN. “The Twitter posts strongly suggest Chesebro committed the crime of making false statements to investigators… his entire cooperation agreement may now fall apart.”It appears Chesebro “hid highly important evidence in the form of these social media posts from the investigators,” Goodman said, adding that it could put Chesebro “at great legal risk.”“We should have asked for clarity, and that was our screw-up,” Chesebro attorney Manny Arora told CNN about Chesebro denying to Michigan prosecutors that he used Twitter. Arora said he has since provided “all the information on BadgerPundit” to investigations in “all the different states that are involved,” where Chesebro sat for interviews.CNN has not reviewed the agreement between Chesebro and the Michigan Attorney General’s office. Wimmer, a spokesman for the office, confirmed that it was a “proffer agreement,” where a witness can provide information with some protection from prosecution. Wimmer declined to describe the details of the agreement.The same prosecutors signed a more sweeping cooperation deal with one of the 16 fake electors where they dropped his charges in exchange for his testimony and future cooperation. That deal required the fake elector to “provide full and complete information” and turn over “any and all relevant documents.” If the cooperator “gives false, incomplete, misleading testimony or information,” the deal would be voided and they’d be “subject to full prosecution, including perjury and obstruction of justice.”CNN was able to verify Chesebro’s connection to the BadgerPundit account by reviewing emails between Chesebro and the Trump campaign that reference the account, as well as by matching numerous biographical details between the two.In an email to Trump attorneys in early December 2020, Chesebro linked to a Google Drive account for the email address TheBadger14@Gmail.com, which was once used by BadgerPundit in a tweet as his contact information. Chesebro also cited the BadgerPundit account in emails to a Trump campaign official and attorney John Eastman on January 5, 2021, pointing to tweets from BadgerPundit arguing that Pence had the authority to pick the electors on January 6.Other biographical details related to his personal life also matched Chesebro, including his current marriage, his past legal work on Bush v. Gore, investments in cryptocurrency, past references to high school and growing up in Wisconsin – the Badger state.BadgerPundit, like Chesebro, said he was with right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on January 6, 2021. The account also references staying at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, from January 3 through the 8 – the same dates Chesebro told Trump lawyers he was staying at the hotel in emails obtained by the January 6 committee.In his interview with Michigan investigators, Chesebro repeatedly tried to downplay his knowledge of the electors plan. He told investigators that he did not know that the Trump campaign planned to deploy “alternate electors” in contested states when he first spoke with the campaign in mid-November 2020.“I naively assumed that it hadn’t occurred to them to have alternate electors. That is, I only thought of it because I’d been involved in Bush v. Gore in 2000 and I’d worked on a law review article with Professor [Laurence] Tribe in 2001 about Bush v. Gore,” Chesebro said. “So, I thought I was educating them about this.”He continued to tell investigators that the plan went beyond what he advised them to do.“The idea of alternate electors wasn’t something I’d come up with and then the Trump campaign learned about it and then backed off. My understanding is that they planned to do this all along,” Chesebro said.Chesebro denied to investigators that at the time he was aware of The Atlantic article from September 23, 2020 detailing how a more radical fake electors plan might work, and he reiterated that he always viewed fake electors as a way to buy more time for lawsuits, and as a contingency to be used only if the Trump campaign had pending litigation in the seven contested states.But privately, as BadgerPundit on Twitter, Chesebro was familiar with the fake electors plot as early as September 2020, and defended the Trump campaign’s ability to pursue the plan just days after the election.As BadgerPundit, Chesebro rebutted a Twitter user who said The Atlantic article foreshadowed the “death of democracy.” Chesebro replied, “it’s called politics, dude,” and argued that state legislatures get the “ultimate call” on who wins and loses presidential elections.Chesebro told investigators that only later did he realize that the Trump campaign had plans to pursue a more radical version of the fake electors scheme no matter what — something that he told investigators he did not advise at the time.“And so my point is, it seems if you credit The Atlantic article, they wanted to do unconditional alternate electors, lobby the state legislatures, and then pressure Pence to back that,” said Chesebro.“I just feel like I was misled into pushing alternate electors for a reason to win more time, to win litigation when there was, there was certainly more to the agenda. I mean, maybe not every person that was in touch with me had this plan, but the campaign as a whole had a different plan than [what] they revealed to me,” said Chesebro.“I certainly would not have said what I said to the electors and advise them on what the campaign wanted if I’d known the campaign had a broader agenda than they told me,” said Chesebro.In his interview with Michigan investigators, Chesebro said that after the 2020 election, he repeatedly advocated for a more conservative approach to the fake electors plot.“Ultimately where I came down was I wanted conditional language in all the states that I suggested three times to Trump campaign on December 12th, that they make it conditional on winning litigation. Number two, I made clear in November 23rd that the state legislatures have no power to, to override the courts. And number three, I made clear in December 13th that I didn’t think Pence should be involved at all,” Chesebro told investigators, adding, “I was never on board with what apparently they planned to do from the beginning, and which they never told me they planned to do.”Less than two days after polls closed on the 2020 presidential election, Chesebro, as BadgerPundit, began publicly tweeting the framework for the “alternate elector” strategy that the Trump campaign ended up pursuing.That included embracing the end-around plan of using state legislatures to overturn the results – which he later claimed to oppose in his interviews with Michigan prosecutors. He tweeted: “the election can’t be rerun. This [sic] only solution is for the Legislature to intervene and select the electors.”In another tweet from November 5, 2020, BadgerPundit outlined a potential plan for Trump.“He will push it all the way to early January, and if necessary, rely on Pence to count only electoral votes sent in by the Republican legislatures, or count no disputed electoral votes, and throw the election to the House, which will elect Trump. 80/20 in Trump’s favor,” he wrote.In a series of tweets, BadgerPundit suggested he knew the plan was extremely controversial and suggested how to make the plot more palatable after a user wrote that no state “will want to be first.”“The key to the politics” of the plan would rest on state legislatures not invalidating the results of election day but rather “expressing their own preference… of electors to be sorted out in January,” Chesebro wrote.Speaking to Michigan investigators, Chesebro criticized the more radical plan put forth by conservative attorney John Eastman, which included having state legislatures choosing their own slates of electors for Pence to count on January 6.“So, Eastman, he had this idea the state legislatures could somehow be effective in overturning the courts, which I thought was ridiculous,” Chesebro told investigators.But under his online alter ego, BadgerPundit, after the election he tweeted numerous times that Pence had the power to count the fake electors benefitting Trump.“I think Pence, in counting electoral votes, could decide that the electoral votes of the legislature take priority,” the pseudonymous Twitter account wrote on November 7, 2020, hours after the election was called for Biden by multiple media outlets.Though Chesebro’s lawyers told CNN that BadgerPundit and the Trump campaign “never intersected,” emails obtained by CNN reveal that he sent two emails to the campaign citing a BadgerPundit thread arguing that Pence had the power to count disputed electoral votes. Chesebro sent the thread to Eastman and Trump lawyer Boris Epshteyn, but he did not tell them it was his account, the emails show.On November 9, 2020, BadgerPundit wrote, “I predict that on December 14, in several states both the Trump and Biden electors will cast their votes, and the electoral votes of any State still in dispute on January 6 won’t be counted. If neither candidate has 270 votes, the House will then vote Trump a second term.”A few days later, on November 11, 2020, BadgerPundit repeatedly tweeted that the fake electors could cast their votes for Trump and that Republican legislatures would certify only those votes.“It’s obvious Trump will win. You overlook the power of the Republican legislatures to certify that Trump is the winner, thus leading the Senate not to find that Biden attained 270 electoral votes. Then, game over,” he wrote.BadgerPundit wrote on December 28, 2020, “My understanding is that they’re the votes of the Trump-Pence electors who were actually on the ballot in the contested States. So if whoever counts electoral votes thinks they won … well, they won.”Chesebro traveled to Washington in early January 2021, he told investigators, to be available for strategy meetings. He was seen outside the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, following Alex Jones.Even after the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, Chesebro continued to insist that Pence had the power to count electors to benefit Trump but “pretended his hands were tied.”BadgerPundit tweeted on January 7, 2021, “But … There was a non-frivolous argument that the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional, and the VP has the power to count, as Jefferson did. Pence could have set up a test case, yet he pretended his hands were tied. And, Trump really believes he won!”"

        "title": "What to watch in Biden’s 2024 State of the Union address",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "President Joe Biden on Thursday will address Congress and the American people in what could be the most consequential speech of his presidency, seeking to boast about his first term while also warning the country about what he views as a ruinous threat to its very existence.While State of the Union addresses have typically been opportunities for presidents to present themselves at their most bridge-building and presidential, the primary results on Super Tuesday, which effectively consolidated the 2024 campaign into a two-man race, gives this year’s speech a political hue.While it remains to be seen how often Biden will invoke former President Donald Trump’s name – or whether he will choose to at all – the 2024 general election campaign, for all intents and purposes, will be kicked off with Biden’s speech.As he delivers the address, Biden will command the attention of what might well be his largest crowd before November, giving voters concerned about his age and stamina a crucial barometer to determine whether the 81-year-old president is up for another four years in the job one month after a special counsel’s report faulted his memory and cognition.It also gives Biden the opportunity to present his administration’s biggest wins directly to the American people, bypassing the traditional media, which Biden has frequently complained obfuscates his accomplishments and base of support.The United States economy has outperformed experts’ expectations since a year ago, when many economists thought it would be undergoing a recession right now.That hasn’t happened for a variety of reasons. It’s not looking like it will anytime soon either with an unemployment rate that’s stayed below 4% for the past 24 months.But Americans aren’t feeling so optimistic. In survey after survey, they’ve conveyed strong disapproval of the state of the economy, something Biden has struggled to wrap his head around.Inflation is at the core of their consternation.Even though price increases have moderated significantly from two years ago, Americans are paying 18% for goods and services compared to before Biden took office, according to Consumer Price Index data.It’s an issue Biden has acknowledged in the past and pledged to fix. His rhetoric on the economy has recently taken a more populist tone, with Biden saying in remarks earlier this year that “For all we’ve done to bring prices down, there are still too many corporations in America ripping people off.”“Price gouging, junk feeds, greedflation, shrinkflation,” Biden said in remarks in Columbia, South Carolina, adding the country is “tired of being played for suckers.”Even Cookie Monster has complained about feeling the pinch in his amorphous wallet.Two days before Thursday’s address, Biden’s administration launched a new strike force with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission “to root out and stop illegal corporate behavior” that results in higher prices for Americans.This effort, aimed at demonstrating to Americans that he hasn’t lost sight of the impact high prices are having, will come up in Biden’s remarks Thursday, White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard told reporters on a call Monday night.The Biden administration has also focused on lowering drug prices and health care costs more broadly, both through laws aimed at reducing costs and through administrative proposals aimed at increasing competition.For instance, the administration proposed a rule in November governing the financial incentives that health insurers offering Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D drug plans can provide to brokers and agents.The proposal would set up guardrails to prevent plans from providing excessive compensation to brokers and agents to steer potential enrollees to their policies rather than those in senior citizens’ best interests.Following the failure, at Trump’s urging, of a bipartisan deal that would have included significant border concessions from Biden, the president promised to make his case directly to the American people – blaming Trump directly for an issue that many Americans say is their top concern heading into November.Biden will have his largest platform yet to do so on Thursday.Visiting the US-Mexico border on the same day as Trump last week, Biden offered his foe an olive branch, entreating the former president to work with him to find a solution that would strengthen the United States’ southern border and overhaul its immigration system.Trump, who hopes to use illegal immigration as a political cudgel against Biden, has not accepted a truce.Biden has repeatedly cited Republican cowardice to stand up to Trump as the key reason why a deal failed. He’ll have a chance on Thursday to call out congressional Republicans directly.He’ll also have the opportunity to elucidate his efforts to protect abortion rights in the United States, and the threat posed to those rights if Trump were to be elected again. The president and his administration have spent much of the time since the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court blaming Trump for the decision.Speaking directly to the Republican-controlled House that dismantled hopes of the border deal that contained funding for Ukraine and Israel, Biden will have the chance to lay out in vivid detail the price of Republican waffling on additional support to the country in its third year of war against Russia.The lack of further US-funded ammunition has had serious consequences for Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield, and Biden has frequently said that history will judge harshly the lack of resolve shown in continuing to fund the country’s defense.The speech comes weeks after Ukraine announced a withdrawal from the strategic hub of Avdiivka after fighting dealt heavy casualties to the Ukrainians, and as other world leaders doubt the future of American leadership abroad in a hypothetical second Trump term.Meanwhile, Trump - who has always been wary of leveling any sort of criticism at Russian President Vladimir Putin - has sharpened his rhetoric around withdrawing the United States from international partnerships, saying he would encourage Russia to attack US allies who don’t meet NATO spending guidelines and offering no criticism of Putin for the death of his leading critic, Alexey Navalny.Perhaps in an effort to drive Biden’s point home, the White House announced that Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, and Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska were both invited by the White House to watch Biden’s address. Neither were able to attend.Biden will also have the opportunity to defend his stance on Israel’s continued war in Gaza, as his continued, albeit increasingly tepid, support for the war threatens to turn a key progressive faction against him.Biden on Tuesday posted a picture on social media of himself reading the first page of his speech’s draft during preparations at Camp David.While that page contained the greetings customarily given by the president to the House speaker, members of Congress, the vice president and the American people, a close look reveals a name Biden hoped to invoke in his address, at least in its initial drafts.Visible semi-transparently through the first page is President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s name and the beginning of his 1941 speech to Congress, in which the nation’s 32nd president famously proposed four fundamental freedoms - freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear - and extolled the virtues of democracy across the world.Opening his address, Roosevelt told members of the 77th Congress that he was speaking to them “at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union.”“I use the word ‘unprecedented,’ because at no previous time has American security been as seriously threatened from without as it is today,” Roosevelt said.Biden has made his own warnings - increasingly dire in recent months - about a threat to the US’ security. But that threat, the president has warned, comes from within.Roosevelt’s speech was given on January 6, 1941 - 80 years to the day before a mob incited by Trump stormed the building where Biden will address the country, in a violent attempt to disrupt the democratic process that put him in office."

        "title": "Older voters in this key battleground state are divided over whether Biden and Trump are too old to be president",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Darrell Ann Murphy teaches Mahjong at the local library with a dual purpose: to create new fans of the game she loves while also helping keep fellow seniors mentally sharp.She begins class with a rule that has nothing to do with how to play the colorful tiles.“We are all here to learn,” is Murphy’s opener. “We are all here for one reason. And we’re never going to talk religion or politics.”Sitting with us in her Easton home, however, the 83-year-old Murphy is happy to share she is a lifelong Democrat, a moderate, a supporter of abortion rights and fierce critic of Donald Trump.“He actually scares me,” Murphy said of the former president. “I think he does not have the best interest of the country at heart.”Easton is a deep blue city in a bellwether purple county in a battleground state that will be pivotal for both control of the White House and the Senate this year.Northampton County has a history of close races, and a history of picking presidential winners.Trump narrowly carried Northampton in 2016 and his narrow win in Pennsylvania was a critical piece of his Electoral College victory. Joe Biden flipped the script in 2020.Murphy shrugs off a conservative who says Biden – at 81 – is too old, dismissing such talk as partisanship. But other recent conversations have her more than a little nervous about the county’s 2024 leanings.“When I start talking about Joe Biden and how I admire and respect him, I get plenty of blowback,” Murphy said. “Plenty of blowback. ‘He is too old. Kamala Harris, forget her.’ Blowback. Now these are people who do not necessarily love Trump. But they talk about wanting a better choice.”Our visit to Easton is the latest stop in a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters in key states or demographic groups. Voters over the age of 65 are the most reliable voting group, and in the nail-biting battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, their support can prove decisive.An afternoon game of Mahjong at Murphy’s home is instructive: Even aging voters are divided over the 2024 age debate.Catherine Long is a fan of Murphy’s rule forbidding talk of religion and politics.“We can’t do that and play the game at the same time,” she said.Friend Mary Ann Horvath added that the policy is wise even when not focusing on pairing Mahjong tiles.“I hardly talk politics with anybody because you just don’t know what the other person believes,” Horvath said. That, everyone at the table agreed, is different from, say, 10 or 20 years ago – when you could debate politics without risking friendships.“Feelings are so much stronger now,” Horvath said.Still, a visitor decides to break the rule, and asks if anyone at the table would prefer younger candidates for president.The divide is immediate.“I think there should be an age limit at the top,” is the view of Pamela Aita.Murphy disagreed and recalled recently attending a friend’s 100th birthday party. “Shirley knows just what is going on politically,” Murphy said. “A lot of older people now are pretty darn sharp.”Aita was not persuaded.“But they are not running the country,” she said. “That person should be able to speak. That person should know who they are speaking to. That person should be able to know simple things that you and I would know. And I don’t think the person in charge of this country at this time is capable of that.”Long offered what she called the counter argument, pointing to the 77-year-old former president: “Donald Trump can’t know the difference between Nancy Pelosi and Nancy Haley.”Murphy was quick with the correction: “Nikki Haley.”“Nikki Haley,” Long repeated. “I get even those confused.”As laughter broke out, Long added this about her memory mixup: “This is what happens.”Larry Malinconico offered a take similar to what we heard from Murphy: He is a Biden fan and sees the age debate as a distraction.“I don’t think he has gotten appropriate credit for the things he has done,” Malinconico said.But he worries enough of his peers and some of his students do see Biden’s age as disqualifying, and he knows what even modest shifts in voter sentiment can mean in Northampton County and Pennsylvania.“I’d be more discouraged this year, at this point, about Trump being elected over Biden,” he said.Malinconico, 71, is a geology professor at Lafayette College in Easton. He is energetic and engaging in the classroom and says his views on age are shaped by his teaching and watching his father live to 94.“I don’t think that age is necessarily a determining factor,” Malinconico said in an interview at his campus office.Still, when we ask if he would have preferred that Biden had decided to serve just one term, and announced that months ago, the answer is, “Yes, I would.”Why?“I think there are people who will not vote for him or sit out because they perceive his age as a potential problem,” Malinconico said. “He looks physically more frail than he did a decade ago or two decades ago. And unfortunately, I think people equate physical frailty with lack of mental acuity. And I think that is wrong.”Malinconico listed reading, Wordle, crossword puzzles and physical activity when we asked what he does to stay sharp. Yes, a memory mixup now and then. But he said he believes his experience makes him a better teacher now than he was 10 or 20 years ago. “I hope to be learning until I die,” he said.Mickey Brown is West Point Class of 1966, which makes him 80. He plays tennis, pickleball and senior softball at this over-55 community in Hanover Township and says Sudoku and reading are his go-tos to keep his mind sharp.Three or four times a week he spends most of the day at a care center where his wife lives because of her dementia.“It’s just something you have to do,” he said, tearing up. “I believe in Jesus and God. I think it keeps me strong and I’ll be fine. And I want to make sure she is taken care of as well as she can be.”Brown is a conservative and two-time Trump voter. But he insists his worries about Biden are based on his experience, not his politics.“Caring for my wife, I see certain things in the way, his mannerisms, that make me wonder if he is really in fact the president,” Brown said.We reminded Brown that Trump, too, often meanders into verbal tangents and of recent episodes where he, at length, mixed up Haley and Pelosi and suggested the former South Carolina governor was somehow in charge of the US Capitol when Trump supporters stormed it on January 6, 2021.“At times I forget something,” Brown said. “Comes back. But I’m fit, I have confidence in myself. I just think the differences between the two are enough for me to be more concerned about Mr. Biden going forward than Mr. Trump.”Pat Levin calls Brown a friend. But she disagrees vehemently with his politics and with his take on Biden’s fitness to serve.“Donald Trump is essentially the same age and makes similar errors,” Levin said. “So I don’t fault Joe Biden. I think that’s just part of life. We are not infallible.”Levin was precise when asked her age: “94 and a half.”We met her at the SteelCore Studio in Bethlehem, where she comes once a week for a workout of crunches, balance exercises and more.“This is important for – to keep me vertical,” Levin said with a playful smile. “At my age I need all the help I can get.”Levin is a lifelong Democrat who is well aware of Northampton County’s bellwether legacy but also tends to forget it on a day-to-day basis, not because of any memory issues but because she generally is in the company of fellow Democrats.“To be honest with you, that always surprises me,” Levin said of Northampton’s history. “Because you tend to spend time with people who think the way we do. So, I think everybody is for Joe Biden until November comes. Then it surprises me.”The president’s age, she said, hardly ever comes up when she is in the company of friends who are about as old as Biden or even, like her, about a dozen years older.“They’re terrified of what might happen if Joe Biden doesn’t win,” Levin said.Terrified of what?“What will happen to this democracy.”Election Day is more than eight months away. Levin would be 95 then. Every crunch at SteelCore is her way of saying age is just a number, and she argues Biden should be judged by his performance, period.“I don’t think age should be a determinant of competence,” Levin said. “I don’t think they go together in any way, shape, or form. I know a lot of young people who are quite incompetent. I know a lot of older people who are very competent. And Joe Biden falls into that category for me.”"

        "title": "Nikki Haley led a historic campaign. Now she faces questions about what comes next",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Since the night of the New Hampshire primary, Nikki Haley has faced one constant question: when would she drop out?It came from GOP party leaders, who called on her to suspend her campaign as former President Donald Trump racked up more wins, and from political observers who assumed she would rather leave the race than face a potentially embarrassing defeat in her home state of South Carolina.But for weeks, Haley made clear publicly and privately that the make-or-break point of her campaign would come on Super Tuesday, when GOP primary voters in more than a dozen states, including delegate rich California and Texas, weighed in.When they did, the answer was crystal clear: Trump won nearly every contest that night, save for Vermont, where his remaining primary rival eked out a victory.“I said I wanted Americans to have their voices heard,” Haley said hours later as she suspended her campaign Wednesday morning. “I have done that. I have no regrets.”Haley had been the first of Trump’s challengers to launch her campaign, and became the last to suspend it. The nearly 13 months of campaigning had come to an end, with Haley becoming the first woman to win a GOP primary contest – but also with Trump still sailing toward his third straight presidential nomination in a row.For now, Haley faces a new question: will she endorse Trump? On Wednesday, she did not, instead calling on the former president to practice the politics of addition and “earn” the vote of those who didn’t back him. Her goal is to open up a conversation about issues within the Republican Party, and to push the party towards unity.In the days leading up to her decision to suspend her bid, her campaign received a significant amount of feedback on the subject of endorsing Trump or not, sources familiar with recent discussions told CNN.People who are close with Haley have different opinions. Some believe that it would be good for her to back Trump because she would be viewed as a team player. Others ardently oppose her endorsing him because that would give Haley the freedom to be critical of Trump and build her own movement. One of those voices told CNN that they believed Haley’s remarks on Wednesday were too forgiving of Trump, particularly when she expressed her “hope” that Trump will be successful in earning the vote of her supporters.The two separate camps have shared those opinions with Haley and her campaign in recent days and weeks, sources said.Haley herself has recently said that she is not focused on endorsing anyone because she is focused on winning herself. She has also pointed to her support, which reached 30-40% in a handful of states, as a sign of Trump’s weakness. According to CNN exit polls in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina and California, only 19% of Haley supporters said they would be satisfied with Trump as the nominee; 79% said they would be dissatisfied.Kimberly Rice, a former New Hampshire representative who served as a co-chair for Haley’s campaign in the Granite State, said she was one of the Haley voters Trump would have to work to win over. She referenced the former president’s statement that Haley’s donors would be “barred permanently” from MAGA world, a move she said she and others took seriously and personally.“It’s one thing to attack a fellow candidate especially on policy issues,” she said. “But when you go for the jugular and you go for personal issues, and then you attack the supporters like that, I think you have to swallow a little humble pie, and try to work on bringing them back in.”Top officials on Haley’s campaign told major donors in recent weeks that Super Tuesday would dictate whether or not Haley stayed in the race, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.They made a persuasive case in these private conversations. Staying in the race through Super Tuesday would give Haley’s team more data about the GOP electorate, the sources said. Haley’s team wanted that data before making the call to suspend her campaign, instead of pulling the plug after only a few states had voted.The benchmark for success was 40% of the vote, building on her previous performances in the early states. Haley ultimately hit that target in just two of the states that voted Tuesday, Utah and Vermont.As a result, most donors are not surprised by Haley’s decision to drop out Wednesday, particularly because they didn’t expect the outcome in the Super Tuesday states to be better than Haley’s previous performances.“She made the right decision and she ran a good race,” said one of the donors. “It was an impressive and smart approach to challenging Trump.”Haley herself engaged in outreach to some top donors very late Tuesday night, one source said. Members of Haley’s team also reached out to top donors to say she was dropping out, sources explained. It is too early to tell where the donors go from here, sources said.As Haley rose in the polls last fall, she gained the backing of several wealthy donors eager to boost a promising alternative to Trump. That support was both a benefit and a burden as her Republican opponents, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, argued that she was beholden to her donors. Haley countered her rivals were jealous they weren’t getting that support.Americans for Prosperity, the political network associated with billionaire Charles Koch, endorsed Haley last November and aided her until the day after the South Carolina primary, when the group said it would stop spending money on her.In the weeks between the January 23 New Hampshire primary and the February 24 South Carolina primary – when questions rose about how long her campaign would last – Haley began investing time and money in Super Tuesday states to help quell rumors she might drop out.“I’m not going anywhere,” Haley told supporters at an event in Costa Mesa, California, in early February. “I’m willing to take the bruises. I’m willing to do the fight and go through the pain. All I’m asking is that you stand there with me.”Haley held more than a dozen events in 10 Super Tuesday states, including Texas, Massachusetts and Virginia.Overall, Haley’s network spent about $82 million on ads, with about $17.9 million coming from her campaign, and $64.4 million from SFA Fund, the lead super PAC supporting her bid. In addition, Americans For Prosperity Action, the Koch-aligned super PAC backing Haley, spent about $8 million on ads supporting her.But that spending shifted in her final week of the race. Haley did not make new investments in television advertising, a decision that was far from unanimous among some of her top supporters and donors who believed she could have made a stronger run against Trump in suburban areas of North Carolina, Virginia, Texas and beyond.It is unclear how much money Haley will close her candidacy with, but the candidate who has reminded supporters at virtually every campaign stop that she is an accountant by trade was intently focused on not going into debt or spending more than her chances warranted, an adviser said. She can also reserve any of her finances for future political endeavors, should she have a future in the Trump-controlled Republican Party.Haley “won’t just go away,” said Katon Dawson, a longtime Haley ally and former chair of the South Carolina Republican Party.“This is not the last you’ve seen of Nikki Haley,” he said. “She will know who her friends are and, I promise, remember who was against her efforts in this endeavor.”"

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "A US Army sergeant has been charged with leaking classified information to China in exchange for $42,000 after prosecutors said he repeatedly sent sensitive documents about some of the military’s most advanced weapons to a foreign national claiming to live in Hong Kong.Prosecutors said Sergeant Korbein Schultz, who served as an intelligence analyst with the 506th Infantry Battalion, repeatedly used his Top Secret security clearance to access classified documents, which he then allegedly sent to the foreign national.Schultz has been charged with conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defense information, exporting technical data related to defense articles without a license, conspiracy to export defense articles without a license and bribery of a public official.It was not immediately clear whether Schultz has legal representation.“The unauthorized sale of such information violates our national security laws, compromises our safety, and cannot be tolerated,” said Henry C. Leventis, US attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee.The foreign national, identified only as Conspirator A in the federal indictment, contacted Schultz during the summer of 2022, asking for information about lessons learned from the war in Ukraine and what that taught the US about defending Taiwan. Prosecutors said Schultz was paid $200 for the first documents.According to prosecutors, that relationship quickly grew.In July of that year, Schultz told Conspirator A that he wanted to turn their relationship into a long-term partnership, according to the indictment. Over the next several months, Schultz allegedly began sending Conspirator A documents about the HIMARS rocket launcher system, hypersonic missiles, information about China’s military and the F-22 fighter jet, one of the most advanced American aircraft.“I will just keep sending you an abundance of information,” Schultz told the conspirator in late-August 2022. Schultz wished he could be “Jason Bourne,” according to the indictment, a reference to the fictional CIA assassin in film.Prosecutors said some of the sensitive information also included details about the U-2 high altitude reconnaissance aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles and more.In exchange, Schultz allegedly received regular payments from Conspirator A, who paid higher prices for more sensitive documents. Between July 2022 and October 2023, Schultz received approximately 14 payments totaling about $42,000.In a video on the Defense Department’s video system from August 2021, Schultz talks about his job helping Afghan refugees as they arrive in the US.“I love being here actually,” he says. “So I joined the Army to help out people because I love to help out people. That’s one of my… some people would say bad talents. But helping people out is possibly the greatest thing that I could ever do.”Schultz’s indictment comes just three days after federal prosecutors announced charges against another service member for leaking classified information.Prosecutors said 63-year-old David Franklin Slater, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who held a Top Secret security clearance at US Strategic Command, sent information from classified briefings on the war in Ukraine to someone claiming to be a Ukrainian woman on a foreign dating website.Slater faces one count of conspiracy to disclose national defense information and two counts of unauthorized disclosure of national defense information. If convicted on all charges, he faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $750,000."

        "title": "Alabama Sen. Katie Britt says ‘the American dream has turned into a nightmare’ in GOP rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, the youngest Republican woman elected to the US Senate, criticized President Joe Biden and his administration over the border, the state of the US economy and crime and safety issues as she delivered the GOP’s rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address.“Right now, the American dream has turned into a nightmare for so many families,” the senator said in her remarks Thursday evening, delivered from her kitchen table in Alabama. “The true, unvarnished state of our union begins and ends with this — our families are hurting, our country can do better.”GOP leaders have touted Britt, 42, as a leading voice in a new generation of Republican lawmakers in an attempt to draw distinction between the Alabama senator and Biden, the oldest president at 81. Republicans often point to the president’s age to make the case that Biden should not serve a second term, although Trump is only a few years younger at 77.“Right now, our commander-in-chief is not in command. The free world deserves better than a dithering and diminished leader,” Britt said. “America deserves leaders who recognize that secure borders, stable prices, safe streets and a strong defense are actually the cornerstones of a great nation.”In her speech, Britt focused heavily on immigration and the border, calling Biden’s border policies “senseless” and “a disgrace.” Referring to Laken Riley, Britt said, “tonight, President Biden finally said her name, but he refused to take responsibility for his own actions.”Riley was found dead last month after jogging near a lake on the University of Georgia campus. Police say she was killed by a man who illegally crossed the border. The 22-year-old died from blunt force trauma to the head, according to Athens-Clarke County Coroner Sonny Wilson.On the economy, Britt portrayed Biden as out of touch and insulated from the concerns of the average American over affordability and the cost of living.“Let’s be honest, it’s been a minute since Joe Biden pumped gas, ran a carpool or even pushed a grocery cart,” Britt said. “Meanwhile, the rest of us see our dollar and we know it doesn’t go as far.”“President Biden just doesn’t get it – he’s out of touch. Under his administration, families are worse off, our communities are less safe and our country is less secure,” she added.Britt was first elected in 2022, when she also became the first woman elected to the Senate from Alabama. With Trump’s endorsement, she succeeded retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, whom she previously served as chief of staff.Biden delivered the annual presidential remarks before a joint session of Congress Thursday evening. It has been an annual tradition for the opposing party to respond to the president’s address since the Reagan era, according to the Senate’s website.Britt’s state has recently been at the center of national headlines after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death — a move that is seen as infringing on IVF and has prompted a number of GOP lawmakers to distance themselves from the decision.In her remarks, Britt said that Republicans “are the party of hard working parents and families and we want to give you and your children the opportunities to thrive and we want families to grow. It’s why we strongly support continued nationwide access to in vitro fertilization. We want to help loving moms and dads bring precious life into this world.”CNN reported that some providers in the state resumed some in vitro fertilization services Thursday, the day after the state’s governor signed a new bill into law aimed at protecting IVF patients and providers from the legal liability imposed on them by the state Supreme Court ruling.The White House pushed back against the rebuttal speech, criticizing Britt for not supporting a major bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package in the Senate and over the issue of IVF access.“Last month, Senator Britt sided against President Biden, the Border Patrol Union, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce by opposing the toughest bipartisan border deal in modern history – instead voting with fentanyl traffickers,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement, adding Britt “just sided with Vladimir Putin and the regime in Tehran in opposition to one of our most urgent national security interests.”Bates specifically criticized Republicans for the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade, saying, “Because an extreme Supreme Court decision overturned Roe v. Wade and set American women back nearly 50 years – with Senator Britt’s support – women across Alabama were just cut off from IVF treatment and dreams of growing their families.”In contrast, he said, the president’s remarks displayed a “vision for the future in which our core freedoms are restored, the middle class is the center of our economy, and our nation is more secure.”This story and headline have been updated with additional developments."

        "title": "CNN Poll: More than 6 in 10 SOTU viewers had a positive reaction to Biden’s speech",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "More than 6 in 10 Americans who watched President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address had a positive reaction to the speech, according to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, with a smaller 35% reacting very positively.That pattern of widespread but tempered positivity mirrors the reception for Biden’s speeches in previous years. Last year, 72% of viewers reacted positively, with 34% saying their reaction was very positive – the lowest “very positive” number in CNN’s polling dating back to 1998. In 2022, 71% had a positive reaction, with 41% saying their reaction was very positive.As in the past two years, Democratic speech watchers’ reactions to Biden were almost universally positive, with about two-thirds of independents who tuned in offering a positive reaction. Roughly three-quarters of Republicans who watched this year’s address offered a negative review, up from about 6 in 10 for Biden’s past two State of the Union addresses.Americans who watched on Thursday said, 62% to 38%, that the policies Biden proposed will move the US in the right direction, rather than the wrong direction. In a survey conducted before the speech, just 45% of those same people said Biden’s policies would move the US in the right direction.Just over 6 in 10 Americans who tuned in expressed at least some confidence in Biden to protect American democracy, while 59% say they have at least some confidence in Biden’s overall ability to carry out his duties as president. Thirty-six percent of those who watched the speech said they have a lot of confidence in Biden to protect American democracy, with 27% expressing some confidence and 37% saying they have no real confidence in him.Following the speech, 31% of those who watched said they have a lot of confidence in Biden’s ability to carry out his duties as president, 28% that they have some confidence, and 41% that they have no real confidence. That’s a slight uptick from a survey conducted in the days before the speech, when 25% of those same people expressed a lot of confidence in his ability, 27% some confidence, and 48% none at all.Much of Biden’s improvement on this score came among political independents who watched the speech. Before the speech, 51% of independents expressed at least some confidence in Biden’s ability to carry out his duties, and that rose to 68% among the same group of independents after the speech. Perceptions of Biden’s ability to carry out the duties of the presidency did not change significantly among either Democrats or Republicans who tuned in.Good marks from speech-watchers are typical for presidential addresses to Congress, which tend to attract generally friendly audiences that disproportionately hail from their own party. In CNN speech reaction polls dating back to the Clinton era, audience reactions have always been positive. But State of the Union addresses rarely lead to significant shifts in presidential approval among the broader American public, particularly in recent years.A 56% majority of Americans who watched the address said that Biden’s economic policies will move the US in the right direction, with 44% saying that his policies will move things in the wrong direction. That’s an improvement from the survey conducted prior to the speech, when 55% of those same people said Biden’s economic proposals would move things in the wrong direction, with much of that movement also coming among independents, from 41% right direction in the pre-speech poll to 61% after the speech. Following last year’s State of the Union, however, a larger 66% majority of those who watched that speech said Biden’s economic policies would move the country in the right direction; in 2022, that number was 62%.About half (53%) of Americans who watched the address said that Biden’s immigration policies will move the US in the right direction, up from 42% in the pre-speech survey. Here, the pre-speech to post-speech change included a shift among both Democrats (from 71% to 83% right direction) and independents (from 42% to 56%).About half of State of the Union viewers, 52%, said that Biden’s proposed policies supporting abortion rights are about what they should be, according to the CNN poll of speech watchers conducted by SSRS. Another 29% said that his policies go too far, and 19% that they don’t go far enough.Roughly half of speech watchers, 53%, also said that the level of US support Biden proposes offering to Israel is about right, with 28% saying he’s proposing too much support, and 20% not enough. And a similar 49% of those who tuned in said Biden’s proposed levels of US aid for Ukraine are about right, with 34% saying Biden’s proposed level of Ukraine aid is too much, and 16% that it’s not enough.A 42% plurality of speech watchers younger than 45 said that Biden’s proposals offer too much support to Israel, an opinion shared by just 22% of viewers age 45 and older. There’s a more modest age divide on Biden’s proposed level of aid to Ukraine.The CNN poll was conducted by text message with 529 US adults who said they watched the State of the Union on Thursday, and are representative of the views of speech-watchers only. Respondents were recruited to participate before the speech, and were selected by a survey of members of the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative panel recruited using probability-based sampling techniques. Results for the full sample of speech-watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.6 percentage points."

        "title": "This is a silly way to run a government, but we do it every year",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "In the weird and wonky world of Washington, funding deadlines written into law are mere suggestions and the threat of a partial government shutdown is always on the horizon.The 2024 fiscal year started on October 1, but lawmakers have yet to officially pass the 12 funding bills that are supposed to form the backbone of discretionary government spending – things like defense spending, etc.Unable to finalize an agreement on those larger bills, lawmakers have passed a series of temporary bills, or “continuing resolutions” – or “CRs,” as they’re referred to in the lexicon of the federal government, which is arguably its own dialect of the English language.Journalists frequently try to translate “continuing resolution” or “CR” into plain English by referring to it as a “stopgap” spending bill or a “short-term” spending bill.The House and Senate passed another short-term extension for part of the government this week, which President Joe Biden signed into law, giving Congress some more time to negotiate spending five months after the fact.The latest in a series of deadlines caused by these temporary spending bills is next Friday, March 8, for part of the government and March 22 for the rest of it.Pretty much every year. Far from a unique occurrence, continuing resolutions are an annual affair.October 1 has been the official kickoff date for the federal fiscal year since 1977. Lawmakers have passed at least one continuing resolution in all but three of the years in the nearly half-century since. The 1997 fiscal year was the most recent one in which no CRs were enacted, according to the Congressional Research Service.Lawmakers don’t even seem to be trying very hard to pass the bills on time at this point. Federal discretionary spending is supposed to be broken down into 12 appropriations bills. In most years for the past two decades, lawmakers haven’t passed a single one by October 1. They haven’t passed half of the appropriations bills on time in any year since 1997.Instead, they will wrap the spending bills into larger packages – frequently called an “omnibus” that is passed in December or later. In 1997, for instance, there was no CR, but the spending bills were all passed together as an omnibus. In 2017, the final bills were not enacted until after May 1, according to the Government Accountability Office.On the one hand, these bills are superior to the alternative, which would be a partial government shutdown. Much has been written about how inefficient, unnecessary and disruptive partial shutdowns can be.CRs are a different kind of inefficient and disruptive occurrence. While government operations and services continue, CRs do have an effect. GAO has written in-depth reports that outline how CRs “slow hiring, create funding uncertainty, and cause administrative burdens.”In years like this one, when a patchwork of CRs extends for a large portion of the year, those effects are amplified.The whole point of Congress approving funding is to guide the federal government. They add funding for certain programs and subtract it for others. With CRs, those tweaks usually aren’t happening.“The thousands of hours agencies spend on budget planning are wasted when Congress simply bypasses the regular appropriations process and uses a CR,” testified Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, in 2018.I asked CNN’s Tami Luhby how the herky-jerky funding process – and simply relying on last year’s funding levels – can affect the way the government provides services to people. She offered up the following examples and argued that the effects are particularly focused on those who depend on government aid for food assistance and help paying for utilities.LUHBY: For instance, WIC, which provides nutrition assistance and education for low-income pregnant women, new mothers and young children, is facing a $1 billion shortfall for the current fiscal year. Enrollment jumped to 6.6 million people in November, up from just under 6.4 million a year earlier, according to the latest federal data.If Congress continues the current funding level for the rest of the fiscal year, about 2 million pregnant women, new moms and kids could lose access to benefits, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Many states are already cutting back on the federal utility assistance they are doling out to residents, who have had to contend with high heating and cooling bills in recent years. Demand for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, is at historic levels as electricity and natural gas arrearages hit record highs, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which began tracking these figures when arrearages exploded at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.In recent years, lawmakers have funneled several billion dollars more into LIHEAP, which typically receives around $4 billion in base funding. But since the fiscal year 2024 funding levels have not yet been set, states must assume they’ll only get the base level. That means they must cut the amount of benefits households receive, reduce the number of people who are helped or cut their cooling programs, among other actions.They are waiting to see if Congress provides the additional $1.6 billion in support that the Biden administration requested in October.Private sector companies could not operate in this way, and neither should the federal government, according to an argument from the Partnership for Public Service, which advocates for good governance and has argued for moving the government funding process to a two-year instead of every year schedule.It’s hard to foster innovation or security if workers are constantly stopping and starting. Other ideas include automatic CRs – almost like an automatic overdraft protection so Congress can debate the larger spending bills instead of wasting time on the temporary ones.Republicans who control the House and Democrats who control the Senate were on the cusp of a funding deal back in January that would have imposed some funding limits for 2024 and 2025 as spending-conscious Republicans demanded.To his credit, instead of embracing a shutdown mentality, House Speaker Mike Johnson has instead kept the government open and kicked the can down the road by utilizing Democratic votes to pass CRs as they iron out the details for the larger bill.CNN’s Capitol Hill team notes the six funding bills that lawmakers have reached an agreement on and plan to pass before March 8 include departments of Agriculture-FDA; Commerce, Justice and Science; Energy and Water Development; Interior; Military Construction-Veterans Affairs; and Transportation-Housing and Urban Development.The remaining six appropriations bills that lawmakers plan to vote on prior to March 22 are Defense; Financial Services and General Government; Homeland Security; Labor-Health and Human Services; the Legislative Branch; and State and Foreign Operations.There is optimism they will figure it out – just in time to get started on next year’s funding. Don’t hold your breath for them to get the 2025 spending bills done on time."

        "title": "Trump allies visit Israel as former president offers few details on how he’d approach Gaza conflict",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Allies of former President Donald Trump held meetings with top officials in Israel last week to discuss the current conflict in Gaza, according to three sources familiar with the trip.The visit – led by Keith Kellogg, a leading national security adviser to the former president who also served in the Trump administration – comes as the presumptive Republican nominee has offered few specifics on how he would approach the war in Gaza, which has emerged in the US as a divisive political issue in a presidential election year. The group that visited Israel is set to deliver a trip report to interested parties, including the Trump campaign, in the coming week, the sources said.It’s unclear who in Trump’s orbit was aware of the visit beforehand, but one Trump adviser told CNN the campaign learned about the trip after the fact. The visit included meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, and Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, the sources said.Kellogg made the trip in his current role as the co-chair of the America First Policy Institute and was accompanied by a handful of other national security experts from the think tank, which appears to be laying the groundwork for a second Trump administration.One source familiar with the meetings said the group came away from the trip with the impression that a two-state solution was not on the table in the near term and that while Israel would favor a short-term halt in the fighting to get hostages freed, the current government is not interested in a long-term ceasefire.Trump, who has revealed little so far on how he would approach the crisis, often says in campaign rallies and speeches that he was the most pro-Israel president in history.Just days after the group returned, Trump was asked in an interview if he supported calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.“Look, I hate seeing what’s happening. Again, it would have never happened. This attack on Israel and likewise Israel’s counterattack, which is what it is, would’ve never have happened if I was president,” Trump said on Fox News, avoiding a direct answer.Trump also appeared to back the Israel Defense Forces’ conduct in Gaza, saying, “You’ve got to finish the problem.”On October 7, Hamas launched a deadly surprise attack on Israel. Israel responded with a brutal military campaign in Gaza – including a ground invasion and airstrikes – that has triggered an ongoing humanitarian crisis.President Joe Biden has faced intense backlash among Muslims, Arab Americans and progressive voters in the US over his public support for Israel as it conducts its operation in Gaza. More recently, Biden and his administration have adopted a tougher tone toward Israel, calling on Netanyahu and his government to ensure adequate humanitarian aid is flowing into the besieged enclave and to limit civilian causalities.Some Trump allies say they see an opening with the growing discontent within Biden’s coalition and the administration’s response – particularly among voters who support Israel. But when Kellogg was in Israel, he was focused on policy, not politics, sources said.“The reality is that Biden’s position on the war is prolonging the war. His administration is no longer acting with clarity and is creating daylight with our No. 1 ally, Israel,” said Aryeh Lightstone, who served as a senior adviser to the Trump administration’s ambassador to Israel and attended many of the meetings with Kellogg. “But Kellogg did not prod Israeli officials to engage with him in a partisan way. The conversations were very factual and policy-focused.”While Trump has positioned himself as a staunch ally of Israel, his personal relationship with the country’s current leader has at times complicated the former president’s public comments on the crisis.The firm friendship between Trump and Netanyahu while Trump was in office has since soured, largely driven by animosity the former president held for Netanyahu ever since the prime minister publicly acknowledged that Biden won the 2020 election.In the months that followed, Trump accused Netanyahu of disloyalty and fumed to Axios, “F*** him.”Trump upset some advisers and allies when he lashed out at Netanyahu just days after the terror attack in Israel, saying during a campaign rally in Florida that the prime minister was caught unprepared by Hamas’ attack.Trump also claimed Israel declined to participate in the 2020 airstrike that killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, saying Netanyahu “let us down.”Trump faced intense backlash following those remarks, and he and his allies have continued to highlight Trump’s positions on Israel while in office, including the signing of the Abraham Accords normalizing diplomatic relations between Israel and certain Arab countries; moving the US embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv; and recognizing the Golan Heights as being under Israeli sovereignty."

        "title": "America has never had a presumptive nominee like Donald Trump",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Donald Trump has put America on notice – his second term would be even more disruptiv﻿e and turbulent than his first.The new presumptive Republican nominee booked his place in a general election rematch with President Joe Biden when his distant, last-remaining rival Nikki Haley conceded to reality and suspended her campaign on Wednesday.The triumph of the once and possibly future president – an incredible comeback given his attempt to steal the 2020 election and a crush of criminal and civil trials threatening his liberty and fortune – sets up one of the most fateful elections in American history. His demonstrated record of contempt for democratic institutions means that the country’s political, legal and constitutional guardrails are facing a severe new test from a GOP candidate who could be a convicted felon by Election Day and who may see restored executive power as a tool to thwart federal prosecutions.And Trump’s return to the threshold of the presidency will send shockwaves around a world still recovering from his volatile leadership and affinity for autocrats and send a warning to Ukraine, a nation fighting for its survival.The reason Trump is so different from a traditional candidate is that he’s not campaigning as a fresh new voice pulsating with optimism for the future or brimming with policy ideas to bring the nation together. He’s portraying America as a dystopian, failed state overwhelmed by lawlessness, urban blight and slipping toward World War III abroad. In a classic trope of dictators, he’s promising to flush out enemies within, vowing revenge on political foes and posing as a strongman while conflating his own personal, political interests with the nation’s.“We’re a third-world country at our borders, and we’re a third-world country at our elections,” Trump said in a Super Tuesday victory speech at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort where he planned his return from political exile. His speech was packed with brazen lies, but it summoned a vision even more bleak than his “American Carnage” inaugural address in 2017. Trump defines this heart of darkness at the end of his campaign speeches with a dirge set against a foreboding soundtrack that thrills his most faithful supporters but turns ideals of American exceptionalism upside down.For Trump, America is not Ronald Reagan’s “shining city on a Hill.” It is a banana republic. “We are a nation in decline, we are a failing nation,” Trump said in one such screed in Manchester, New Hampshire, in January, portraying the US as beset by rampant inflation, energy shortages, drug infested cities, out-of-control immigrant crime and even dirty, crowded airports. “Who are these people who would do this to us? Who are these people that would ruin our country?” Trump asked.“We are a nation that has lost its confidence, its willpower and its strength. We are a nation that has lost its way,” Trump went on. “2024 is our final battle. We will demolish the deep state, we will expel the warmongers from our government – we will drive out the globalists, we will cast out the Marxists, the communists and fascists. We will rout the fake news media, we will drain the swamp. … We will be a liberated country again.”It’s a commentary on the current national mood that this is an enticing message to many Republicans, after a quarter of a century of growing disillusionment with a federal government that presided over draining foreign wars, financial crises, the flight of blue-collar jobs abroad and a pandemic that further shattered trust in institutions and was exploited by the far-right media industrial complex. Trump has deepened the national estrangement by successfully convincing millions of voters of the lie that the 2020 election was stolen and that Biden’s win was illegitimate in a way that is likely to further tarnish US democracy for years to come.Trump has also leveraged his extraordinary legal quagmire – as he faces nearly half a billion dollars in outstanding civil judgments and four looming criminal trials – to paint himself as a persecuted political dissident. This is yet another example of the ex-president’s quintessential talent of spinning compelling alternative realities that his opponents often find it almost impossible to counter. The collision between Trump’s legal entanglements and a federal election, meanwhile, risks making the constitutional complications of his first term seem like a warm-up act.Trump, 77, will face an 81-year-old incumbent who has, by conventional standards, had a successful tenure – pushing through more major legislation than any first-termer for years. The economy is healthy, unemployment is low, growth is strong and the US is outperforming most industrialized nations. After Trump demoralized US allies in his first term, Biden has reinvigorated and expanded NATO in responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – an illegal land grab Trump suggests he will reward.But the ex-president’s chances of re-gaining power are considerable since Biden is still deeply unpopular as high grocery prices and rent are robbing Americans of the normality that the president promised to return to them after the pandemic. Trump is seizing on his successor’s failure to fix a border crisis to conjure fears across the country of a migrant invasion that could dilute America’s White social culture in demagoguery that chillingly recalls 1930s fascism.And Biden’s perceptible aging – including a stiffened gait, reedy voice and the loss of the energetic persona that was his trademark for decades – means many voters are skeptical that he’s fit for a second term that would end when he is 86.Because of Trump’s extremism and to some extent his own political liabilities, Biden is anchoring his campaign on a warning that his predecessor is not just a threat to democracy but that he’d destroy it. And he’s trying to remind Americans of the chaos and division that characterized Trump’s term, amid apparent nostalgia among some voters for the golden age of stability the ex-president and his aides are selling.“My message to the country is this: Every generation of Americans will face a moment when it has to defend democracy. Stand up for our personal freedom. Stand up for the right to vote and our civil rights,” Biden said in a statement Tuesday.“To every Democrat, Republican, and independent who believes in a free and fair America: This is our moment. This is our fight. Together, we will win.”This approach worked in 2020 when Biden narrowly ejected Trump from the White House. And his democracy message surprised pundits when he led Democrats to a 2022 midterm election performance that defied historic omens of electoral disaster. But he’s now facing a referendum on his own record that many voters disdain. And Trump is on a roll after a dominating performance in Super Tuesday primaries cemented his dominance of the GOP.An election that could change the nature of life in the United States and transform the country into a force for global instability abroad looks certain to be decided by a few thousand votes in either direction in a handful of swing states.Trump’s threat to democratic institutions and the rule of law is not a matter of conjecture. The former president is telling the country exactly what he’d do if he becomes only the second former commander in chief – after Grover Cleveland in 1892 – to win a second, non-consecutive term.Simply put, Trump is running on the most extreme platform in modern history. He has called for the termination of the Constitution. He wants the Supreme Court to grant unchecked power to the presidency, which he plans to use in a personal quest for “retribution” against his enemies. He is pledging to gut the civil service in government departments and to fill posts with political operatives. He’s signaled he’d use the Justice Department not as a quasi-independent arbiter of the rule of law but as a personal political enforcement machine. Many of Trump’s former officials fear he’d pull out of NATO, trash the post-World War II international system and side with dictators.He says undocumented immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of the country and vows mass deportations and detention camps. He’s drawn allusions to 1930s dictators by calling his opponents “vermin.” On Tuesday night, an ex-president who has already incited violence to achieve his ends warned supporters that if he didn’t win in November, “We’re not going to have a country.”It was once fashionable for Trump apologists to chide those who took his threats literally. But after the horror of January 6, 2021, when a pro-Trump mob he told to “fight like hell” beat up police officers, ransacked the US Capitol and tried to block Biden’s legitimate presidency, his rhetoric seems like a chilling harbinger of a second term far more extreme than the first.But despite his huge wins through key states and dominance of the delegate race – by Wednesday morning he had 1,040 compared to Haley’s 86 – the ex-president’s primary campaign highlighted real liabilities. In state after state, Haley outperformed Trump in suburban areas that are home to moderate and more highly educated Republican voters. This is significant because these are the areas that will decide the 2024 election and Biden must persuade many of the GOP voters who are alienated by Trump and who voted for Haley to pick him.But the president has his own vulnerabilities. There have been flashing warning signs that he’s struggling to rebuild the diverse coalition that helped him win the White House four years ago. The recent Michigan primary, which saw an organized revolt by Arab American, younger and progressive voters over his handling of Israel’s war in Gaza, highlighted Biden’s exposure to the possibility that key members of his voting bloc could decide to stay home in November. The push by third-party voters, including Democrat-turned independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., could further squeeze Biden’s margins in key swing states and hand the election to Trump.Americans must now face the reality of the election that many have long dreaded. A rematch between two flawed candidates that nevertheless could change the character of the nation."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Some Chinese-made cranes used at US ports contain communications equipment with no clear purpose or record of their installation, according to a new congressional investigation that will heighten US concerns that the cranes could be used for surveillance or sabotage.The investigation by the House Committee on Homeland Security and House select committee on China focused on the more than 200 Chinese-made cranes installed at US ports and related facilities. It comes amid heightened US-China tensions over national security and as the Coast Guard last month ordered the ports to better secure the Chinese-made cranes.House lawmakers found that the equipment installed on the cranes — cellular modems that can be used for remote communication — were not documented in any contract between US ports and Chinese crane maker ZPMC, a congressional aide familiar with the investigation told CNN. When US port personnel went to China to inspect the cranes, the modems were already installed, the aide said.The modems were found “on more than one occasion” on the ZPMC cranes, the aide said.“Our Committees’ investigation found vulnerabilities in cranes at U.S. ports that could allow the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] to not only undercut trade competitors through espionage, but disrupt supply chains and the movement of cargo, devastating our nation’s economy,” Rep. Mark Green, the Republican chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement to CNN.“Without a swift sea-change, we will continue to gift the CCP with an easy means of infiltrating our critical infrastructure on their quest for global dominance.”In a statement on its website, ZPMC said it “has always been committed to providing high-quality products and services to clients around the world. ZPMC always strictly complies with the laws and regulations of applicable countries.”Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, told CNN that claims that Chinese-made cranes pose a security risk are “entirely paranoia.”“We firmly oppose the US overstretching the concept of national security and abusing national power to obstruct normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US,” Liu said.The Wall Street Journal first reported on the congressional probe’s findings.Ship-to-shore cranes are key to moving goods through US maritime ports, which generate trillions of dollars in economic activity each year, according to experts. Chinese-made cranes account for nearly 80% of the cranes used at US ports, according to the Coast Guard.Cranes can often be controlled remotely, meaning that a hacker with access to the cranes’ networks could collect intelligence from ports or, in theory, even cause disruptions of equipment.The Biden administration last month announced plans to invest $20 billion in new US-made port infrastructure, including US-made cranes that officials say are less of a security risk.A lot of machinery in the maritime and oil and gas sectors has hardware, such as cellular modems, that technicians use for remote maintenance, according to Marco Ayala, an industrial cyber expert with years of experience in the maritime sector.But this hardware is not always well documented by some of those critical facilities, opening up security risks, said Ayala, who is president of the Houston chapter of InfraGard National Members Alliance, a public-private threat-sharing organization.Having modems embedded in cranes’ operational system “physically bypasses” the ports’ traditional IT security defenses, Ayala told CNN. US government and private maritime experts are trying to change that with more rigorous security assessments, he added."

        "title": "Senior US general warns about Russia’s growing influence in Africa",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The head of US Africa Command warned Congress on Thursday that Russia is aggressively working to expand its footing among African countries, leaving several “at the tipping point” of falling under its influence.“[A] number of countries are at the tipping point of actually being captured by the Russian Federation as they are spreading some of their false narratives across Libya and from a strategic answer piece, access and influence across the whole Maghreb,” Marine Corps Gen. Michael Langley told the Senate Armed Services Committee. “That is NATO’s southern flank. We need to be able to have — maintain access and influence across the Mahgreb, from Morocco all the way to Libya.”There are hundreds of US service members in Africa, according to AFRICOM. US officials have warned for years now that both Russia and China are working to tighten their grips on the continent. The former head of US Africa Command, Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, said in 2019 that Russia was using mercenaries and arms sales to gain access to natural resources in Africa.“They want to have influence on the continent,” Waldhauser told Congress at the time. Langley said Thursday that the US has been “drowned out” by Russian disinformation in previous years, leading to Russia’s success in stoking “a lot of the instability across the Sahel.”“I would say the Russian Federation’s narrative drowned out the US government’s in the past years. They were excelling,” Langley said. “The Russian Federation — not just through Wagner — stoked a lot of the instability across the Sahel. They did this through misinformation, disinformation campaigns.”Langley called for more resources to combat Russia’s narrative, particularly more resources for US information operations. But it wasn’t just Russia Langley warned of; both Russia and China, he said, have “long-range plans” on the continent.“They want that ground. They want power projection capabilities. … But I think at accelerated pace, the Russian Federation is really trying to take over central Africa as well as the Sahel,” he said.Langley also made the case on Thursday for more seats for African military partners in US military education programs, saying leaders in Morocco, for example, “keep asking us for more seats because the United States doesn’t offer enough.”“That is also competing with the Russian Federation. They’re beating us 12-to-1,” Langley said.Langley emphasized that the US maintains a significant advantage over both countries with its state partnership program, which pairs US state National Guard units with foreign militaries. There are currently National Guard partnerships with 18 African countries, according to AFRICOM, including Kenya, Niger, Liberia, Djbouti, Burkina Faso, Rwanda and Tunisia.That program is “unrivaled,” Langley said Thursday, and is a significant advantage over Russia and China on the continent. He and the National Guard Bureau Chief, Gen. Daniel Hokanson, have been laying out a plan into “the rest of the decade” that would develop “more strategic partner programs across the continent.”“Here’s how it helps: In our overall competition with the PRC and Russian Federation, they can’t match that,” Langley said. “The way we build and partner with our countries, build with our African partners, builds capacity and capabilities, and it also gives them an appreciation for the rule of law, law of armed conflict, in working with their partners and makes them even more resilient.”"

        "title": "The general election is here and it’s Trump vs. Biden",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Donald Trump left the White House a loser.But now, only one man – President Joe Biden – can thwart his predecessor’s return in what would be the most astonishing political comeback in history.Only three years after Trump slunk out of Washington in disgrace – days after the mob he told to “fight like hell” ransacked the US Capitol – and even as he faces four looming criminal trials, he has already engineered a bounce back for the ages in the Republican primary.Trump went on a roll on Super Tuesday. He won the Virginia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Maine, Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, Colorado, Minnesota, Massachusetts and California Republican primaries. Every big state called in his favor brought the ex-president ever closer to a general election campaign against his 2020 vanquisher that polls show he’s got at least an even chance of winning.To adapt the title of one of his books, it’s the “Art of the Comeback.”As the results rolled in, Biden and Trump took aim at each other, setting the stage for what is sure to be a bitter clash in November certain to cleave even deeper national political divides.“We’re going to win this election because we have no choice,” Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago resort as he savored his sweetest election night since he beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. He spoke against a backdrop of American flags that conjured the theatrics of the presidency that he hopes to regain.Trump evoked his one-term in the White House as if it was some kind of economic golden age and added: “If we lose this election, we’re not going to have a country.” That last line was a chilling echo of his searing speech in Washington on January 6, 2021, before the most brazen attack on democracy in modern American history.Biden reacted to Trump’s Super Tuesday victories by immediately cranking up his general election attack on the former president – previewing an argument that will be at the center of his own campaign for a second term.As he seeks to paper over his vulnerabilities on issues like immigration and the economy, Biden is warning that Americans face an existential dilemma.“Tonight’s results leave the American people with a clear choice: Are we going to keep moving forward or will we allow Donald Trump to drag us backwards into the chaos, division, and darkness that defined his term in office?” Biden said in a statement.“If Donald Trump returns to the White House, all of this progress is at risk. He is driven by grievance and grift, focused on his own revenge and retribution, not the American people. He is determined to destroy our democracy … and he’ll do or say anything to put himself in power.”Officially, the ex-president is still short of the delegates needed to be the presumptive GOP nominee. He’ll probably push past the magic number of 1,215 next week. His wins Tuesday obliterated any hypothetical path to the nomination for his last GOP rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who announced Wednesday that she is exiting the race. Haley withheld an endorsement of Trump, calling on him instead to earn the support of voters who backed her.His cruise through this year’s primaries has underscored his utter dominance of the Republican Party. It has highlighted his imperviousness to scandals and shame that doom mortal political careers – at least among activist voters who decide the GOP nomination.Hundreds of thousands of Republican voters can’t sign up fast enough for Trump’s vows of “retribution” against his enemies as he paints a dark picture of a nation paralyzed by crime, invaded by migrants and slipping toward World War III.Democrats will enter a rematch with Trump deeply concerned, given Biden’s rock-bottom approval ratings and increasing public doubts over whether the oldest president in history is fit to serve a second term that would end when he is 86. Many voters still feel deeply insecure despite the robust economic recovery that has racked up record job numbers and is outpacing other industrialized states. Still, elevated grocery prices and high rents are a reminder that many are waiting for the return to pre-pandemic normality that Biden promised in 2020.Yet amid Trump’s dominance, there were sufficient data points to suggest that he’s still beset by some liabilities that resulted in his ejection from the White House four years ago. His greatest weakness still lurks – his character and extremism alienate more moderate, suburban voters. The fate of the 2024 election may well rest on whether GOP primary voters who picked Haley in such areas overcome their antipathy and vote for Trump in November.The Biden campaign has long said that the president’s polling numbers are being depressed by the fact that he’s not yet being judged as the alternative to Trump. The time for that excuse is going to fast run out now that the shape of the 2024 general election is clear.“Tonight the campaign started up,” Biden’s National Campaign Co-Chair Mitch Landrieu told CNN on Tuesday night. “Until now, people didn’t think it was going to be Biden versus Trump, but here we are and we’re ready to go,” he said.Other politicians have seen their careers in tatters and come back to triumph. Richard Nixon lost the 1960 presidential election and then a California gubernatorial race two years later. He vowed people wouldn’t have the chance to kick him around anymore as political retirement beckoned. But in 1968, he was back and won the presidency.Bill Clinton was mired in personal scandals in the 1992 presidential primary race but became the “comeback kid” in New Hampshire on the way to the White House. And Biden cemented his grip on the Democratic nomination four years ago on Super Tuesday after a disastrous tramp through early state contests that he only turned around with a victory over Bernie Sanders in South Carolina several weeks before.But Trump faced headwinds like no candidate before him. They include two impeachments, 91 criminal charges, four criminal trials, a devastating $450 million civil court judgment pending and a legacy scarred by chaotic leadership in a pandemic. But none of it stopped his surge toward the GOP nomination. Indeed his manipulation of his indictments – including for his attempt to steal the 2020 election – energized supporters as he branded himself a persecuted dissident.One-term presidents are almost always done after being drummed out of the White House. But Trump’s surge to the GOP nomination means he has a chance to emulate the ultimate comeback in American politics – the victory of former President Grover Cleveland over sitting President Benjamin Harrison. In 1892, Cleveland became the only commander in chief (so far) to win a non-consecutive second term.One reason why Trump didn’t come across as a loser to his supporters was that he convinced grassroots GOP voters that he didn’t actually lose the 2020 election. Even though he did. Tuesday’s early exit polls showed that about 6 in 10 GOP primary voters in North Carolina believe that Biden’s victory over Trump four years ago was illegitimate. Roughly half of Republican primary voters in Virginia thought the same, mirroring sentiments of Trump supporters all around the country that reflect the former president’s unmatched capacity to create an alternative reality.The bond between Trump and his most faithful supporters was never severed. Their unstinting affection for their champion became clear as soon as long lines of supporters lined up all day, shivering in their “Make America Great Again” souvenir regalia, outside his early events in frigid Iowa and New Hampshire in January.Trump’s march toward the GOP nomination is even more striking given how far his political star had dimmed. His intervention in the 2022 midterms was mainly disastrous as he strong-armed candidates in swing states that signed up to his election denialism – often at the price of seats his party might have won. Democratic control of the Senate and the tiny House GOP majority that fell short of red wave expectations were widely blamed on his botched strategizing. When people started filing out of Trump’s early presidential announcement speech at Mar-a-Lago late that year, it appeared that the former president was a busted political force and that 2024 would be a race too far.The key to Trump’s lasting resurgence may turn out to lie in an extraordinary moment inside a notorious jail in Atlanta last in August. Trump became the first former president to suffer the indignity of providing a mug shot, as he surrendered following his fourth criminal indictment.But Inmate No. P01135809 did not cower in shame. He weaponized his misfortune, claiming he was being persecuted by the administration of his successor to ensure he couldn’t mount a political comeback. Trump’s fundraising soared. His Republican true believers embraced his narrative of political martyrdom. And Trump’s potential 2024 GOP rivals soon found their running room clipped.Former Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to aid Trump’s Constitution-busting on January 6, quickly worked out there’s no room in the modern GOP for standing up for democracy. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had a theory that what Republican voters wanted after the mayhem of the Trump years was the same kind of “Make America Great Again” extremism minus the chaos. Wrong again. And the campaign of the last-standing Haley will mostly be remembered for disproving the long-held conventional wisdom that once the ex-president got in a one-on-one race with an opponent, the anti-Trump forces in the party would soon overwhelm him.Trump beat them all. And now he’s taking on Biden."

        "title": "What to know about Super Tuesday",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "It’s an important new phase of presidential primaries, when the early contests are over and voters from multiple states cast ballots in primaries timed to occur on the same date.It’s called “Super Tuesday,” and it is important even though neither Democratic President Joe Biden nor former President Donald Trump has had to sweat the competition this year. Primaries on Tuesday may offer the final opportunity for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s quixotic and lackluster effort to challenge Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.Instead of a single primary or caucus, Super Tuesday lumps together 15 contests for Republicans and 16 contests for Democrats spread across the country.More than a third of Republican delegates are at stake along with an equally large portion of Democratic delegates. Biden is undefeated in primary contests this year, and Trump has lost only one.A large sample of the country will have contests on Super Tuesday – red states and blue states from the North, South, East and West.The primaries at stake include the first three states in the alphabet, as any schoolkid should be able to tell you: Alabama, Alaska (for Republicans) and Arkansas. In addition, there are California and Colorado; Maine, Massachusetts and Minnesota; North Carolina; Oklahoma; Tennessee and Texas; Utah; and Vermont and Virginia.Tuesday also marks the end of Democrats’ mail-in presidential preference process in Iowa, and a Democratic caucus in American Samoa.In 2016, Super Tuesday was the moment when Trump really seized control of the Republican primary. Trump won seven of the 11 contests that day, although he lost the largest prize, Texas. There was still a spirited race for delegates in 2016, as opposed to this year, when Trump has won nearly every contest before Super Tuesday and has a growing delegate lead over Haley.In 2020, Biden won 10 of 14 contests on Super Tuesday. He has not faced any serious competition from Democrats this year and is expected, as is traditional for incumbents, to win every contest Tuesday.For Republicans, the question is whether Haley can gain any traction. She has won only one contest – the primary in Washington, DC, CNN projected Sunday. She is falling far behind in terms of delegates, but Haley insists that Republicans deserve a second option.Barring some unforeseen eruption of support for Haley, will a setback on Super Tuesday push her out of the race?For Democrats, Biden is coming off a wake-up call in Michigan. He won the Democratic primary there easily, but more than 100,000 Democratic primary voters chose “uncommitted” rather than Biden. “Uncommitted” won two of Michigan’s delegates, the only delegates Biden has lost so far.As the Palestinian death toll in Gaza exceeds 30,000 people, the Democratic primary voters in a state with a strong Arab American and Muslim population were protesting the president’s Israel policy and want him to push much more forcefully for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Are there signs of more protest on Super Tuesday?Meanwhile, neither of the Democrats challenging Biden has gained much traction. Rep. Dean Phillips has failed to get out of the single digits in states where Biden has campaigned. One former, fringe rival, Marianne Williamson, has actually taken the unusual step of unsuspending her campaign.Not technically on Super Tuesday. Neither candidate can win a majority of the delegates until later in March, with both candidates likely to pass the “magic number” on March 12 or March 19.Trump will need to win 1,215 of 2,429 delegates, while Biden needs 1,968 out of 3,934 delegates.Regardless, primaries will continue until early June. Conventions don’t take place until July for Republicans and August for Democrats.The modern primary system has only grown up in recent decades. Super Tuesday has grown with it. The term was first used in the 1980s. Democrats in Southern states, wanting a moderate candidate, timed their primaries for more power in the process. It has not always achieved that goal.Then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, a liberal, largely put the 1988 Democratic primary away with victories on Super Tuesday. In 1992, however, then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton completed his comeback by sweeping Southern states on Super Tuesday that year.In 2008, 21 states held contests on a Super Tuesday in early February, an example of front-loading the primaries. But then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton split the delegates among Democrats. Sen. John McCain decisively pushed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney from the GOP race.This story has been updated with additional developments."

        "title": "Biden campaign recognizing unionizing efforts by headquarters staff",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The Biden campaign is recognizing efforts by staff at its Wilmington, Delaware, headquarters to unionize, kickstarting a bargaining process that could address wages, working hours and working conditions for some of the individuals pushing to reelect President Joe Biden.The unionization effort is affiliated with the Campaign Workers Guild, a non-partisan labor union founded in 2017 to represent workers on campaigns and political committees, and negotiations between the union and campaign are expected to begin in the near future.“We are thrilled to announce that the Biden Union-Campaign Workers Guild has been recognized by campaign leadership,” the Biden Union-Campaign Workers Guild said in a statement. “All workers deserve a union, and we look forward to working with management to build an equitable contract that is in line with the values this campaign fights for and raises the bar for campaign and political workers across the country.”Democratic campaigns and committees have embraced moves by their staff to unionize in recent years as they look to live up to the pro-labor platforms they pitch to voters. It comes as the president has sought to strengthen his union bona fides as he prepares to face off against former President Donald Trump, who is also making a play for union voters heading into November.More than 175 people currently work at Biden campaign headquarters and there are plans to expand the staff in Delaware in the coming months, a source familiar with the matter said. Part of the bargaining process will include determining which headquarters staff would be eligible to join the union, sources familiar with the matter said.Negotiations are expected to touch on wages, working hours and working conditions for staffers at the campaign’s main office in Delaware. Sources tied to the union push declined to outline what initial terms will be pursued in talks.“Joe Biden has spent his entire career supporting the labor movement and standing with workers. As the most pro-union president in American history, the president is proud that his staff has decided to form a union, as they did four years ago,” campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez told CNN in a statement. “We look forward to working collaboratively with CWG on an agreement that we will all be proud of.”Field organizers on Biden’s previous campaign unionized in May 2020. They worked with Teamsters Local 238 to secure a $15 minimum wage, overtime pay if working more than 40 hours in a week and a six-day work week.In this campaign cycle, field organizers are expected to be hired by the coordinated campaign. Organizing staff working in battleground states are covered by collective bargaining agreements which are negotiated by state parties, a Democratic National Committee spokesperson said.The DNC saw its staff unionize in 2022. Non-managerial and non-temporary full-time and regular part time employees at the committee’s headquarters are eligible to join the union, which is represented by SEIU Local 500 and is now in its second contract.Biden has long touted himself as the most pro-union president in history and is once again making a pitch for working class voters in his reelection bid. He most recently secured the endorsement of the United Auto Workers, a key force in blue wall states like Michigan and Wisconsin. The UAW’s President Shawn Fain will attend the president’s State of the Union on Thursday as a guest of first lady Dr. Jill Biden.But while the president has won the backing of union leadership, it’s unclear whether that will translate into support from rank-and-file members, whom Trump is also trying to woo in this campaign.On Tuesday, the president is slated to attend a roundtable with rank-and-file members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters after Trump met with the group earlier this year. The Teamsters backed Biden in 2020 but are still weighing an endorsement in the 2024 race."

        "title": "Fact Check: Trump claims 325,000 migrants ‘were flown in from parts unknown’",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "In remarks Tuesday night, former President Donald Trump said, “It was announced that 325,000 people were flown in from parts unknown. Migrants were flown in — airplane — not going through borders, not going through that great Texas barrier.”Facts First: This is misleading.Trump appeared to be citing a new report released by the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that supports curbing immigration to the United States. In a March 4 piece, Todd Bensman, a senior national security fellow at CIS, outlined information he says he obtained through a FOIA lawsuit, stating that that US Customs and Border Protection “approved secretive flights” that brought 320,000 migrants to select airports in the US last year.CBP, though, did not facilitate the flights, and the program by which the migrants entered the United States is public information, not secretive. The article also omits who is being flown within or to the United States: migrants who are approved and vetted.Migrants who flew to and within the United States were allowed entry and thoroughly vetted through CBP One — a mobile app that allows users to schedule appointments to claim asylum with border authorities.There are also multiple parole programs that allow individuals to enter and live in the United States for a temporary period, typically no longer than a year. These programs include family reunification, which is available on a case-by-case basis and by invitation only as well as a separate humanitarian parole program for migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. After receiving approval, such migrants may enter the US through a land port of entry or fly into the US, but they are responsible for paying for their own flights.In January, for example, CBP processed around 45,000 individuals through CBP One appointments at ports of entry, according to federal data.Since the parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV) was introduced more than a year ago, over 386,000 people of those nationalities have arrived. In addition to vetting, those who enter the US under that parole program are also required to have sponsors in the US. The purpose of the program is to keep people from crossing the border illegally by providing a legal pathway to the US.It’s unclear how CIS reached the 320,000 figure, which the group attributes to information received via its lawsuit. The article says the government characterizes the programs as family reunification programs.A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland security told CNN, “More than 14 months ago, on January 5, 2023, DHS announced processes providing certain Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans who have a supporter in the United States, undergo and clear robust security vetting, and meet other eligibility criteria, to come to the United States in a safe, orderly, and lawful way. These processes were built on the success of the process for Venezuelans.”“These processes are part of the Administration’s strategy to combine expanded lawful pathways with stronger consequences to reduce irregular migration, and have kept hundreds of thousands of people from migrating irregularly. The CHNV parole processes are public; claims of a secret program are false,” the spokesperson added.The CIS article says the government told it that disclosing information about the airports involved could create “operational vulnerabilities” at those airports, saying that sharing operational details would open up the program to exploitation by “bad actors.” Although the CIS article calls the government’s position “novel and newsworthy,” the government’s response is standard for inquiries involving law enforcement.Republicans have slammed the Biden administration’s use of parole – which has been used by many administrations – arguing that officials are using the authority too broadly.The Biden administration has leaned on parole in urgent situations, including to admit Afghans after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, Ukrainians after Russia’s invasion, and other times, to allow migrants from designated countries to temporarily live and work in the US as a way to mitigate surges at the border."

        "title": "See how much student loan debt Biden has canceled",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "President Joe Biden’s plans to deliver widespread student debt relief were dealt a serious blow last year when the Supreme Court struck down his one-time student loan forgiveness program. But he has still managed to cancel more federal student loan debt than any other president.As the November election gets closer, Biden’s team is eager to tout what he’s done to address student loan debt – with the administration recently sending congratulatory emails to 153,000 debt-relief recipients – even if his actions fall short of some Democrats’ expectations.Since taking office, Biden’s administration has approved the cancellation of about $138 billion in federal student loans – wiping out debts for about 3.9 million borrowers – by using a number of existing programs that aim to offer debt relief for certain groups of struggling borrowers.The amount Biden has canceled is equal to nearly 9% of the $1.6 trillion of federal student loan debt currently held by borrowers.It’s about one-third of the amount of student loan debt that would have been canceled by his broad forgiveness program. About $430 billion would have been forgiven last year if the Supreme Court had allowed that program to take effect.The Supreme Court ruled that the executive branch does not have the authority to implement Biden’s broad forgiveness program, which would have canceled up to $20,000 for borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year.The one-time cancellation program would have benefited millions of people, but it drew some criticism because it would not have helped future borrowers or addressed the larger issue of the rising cost of college.What Biden has been doing – before and after the Supreme Court ruling – is using existing student loan forgiveness programs to deliver relief to certain groups of borrowers, like public-sector workers (through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program) and borrowers who were defrauded by their college (through the borrower defense to repayment program). His administration also made discharges for borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled.None of these programs expire, meaning they will help qualifying borrowers now and in the future. In some cases, Biden’s administration has expanded the reach of these programs, making more borrowers eligible.And in other cases, it has made an effort to correct past administrative errors made to borrowers’ student loan accounts by conducting a one-time recount of borrowers’ past payments. This effort helps make sure people receive the loan forgiveness they may already qualify for by having made at least 20 years of payments in an income-driven plan, which calculates monthly payment amounts based on a borrower’s income and family size, rather than the amount owed. The recount is expected to be completed by July.Many of the Biden administration’s actions have helped chip away at a backlog of student loan forgiveness applications left over from the Trump administration, which tried to limit some debt-relief programs and slowed processing of applications.Last year, the administration created a new income-driven repayment plan. Known as SAVE, the new plan offers the most generous terms for low-income borrowers. Those who originally borrowed $12,000 or less will see their remaining debt canceled after making payments for at least 10 years.It remains to be seen if Biden will get a political boost from his student debt cancellation efforts in November’s election.In a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in January, 46% of US adults said Biden has the “best approach” to lowering student debt burdens, compared with 22% who said Donald Trump does.But Biden’s actions have fallen short of what other Democratic leaders – like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren – repeatedly called for when he came to office. They wanted the president to cancel $50,000 of student loan debt per borrower – an amount Biden argued was too high.Still, the Biden administration is working on implementing another path toward a broad student loan forgiveness program, this time relying on a different legal authority in hopes that this attempt holds up in court. This proposal is currently making its way through a lengthy rulemaking process and has yet to be finalized."

Both were naturalized as US citizens, but they are ineligible to serve as president and therefore cannot be the designated survivor.This story has been updated with additional reporting."

        "title": "Takeaways from Joe Biden’s State of the Union address",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "President Joe Biden delivered a raucous third State of the Union address, one that could be among the most important speeches he gives during his presidency as he turns toward reelection.His list of objectives was long: Tout his accomplishments in office, look ahead to a second-term agenda, allay concerns about his age and fitness and provide a contrast with Republicans, including his rival Donald Trump.The result was a fiery speech that bore little resemblance to his States of the Union past. Intent on displaying his energy and eager to engage with Republicans, Biden delivered a starkly political speech that his aides hope can ease Democratic jitters about his political prospects.Here are five takeaways from Thursday’s State of the Union:Biden may not have uttered his predecessor’s name during his remarks, but there was little question that Trump was at the center of the State of the Union, making Thursday’s speech a particularly politically tinged yearly address.It was reflective of the extraordinary political moment Biden finds himself in, where the political norms of the past decades – ones Biden has openly pined for – have been largely swept aside.The president took multiple swipes at Trump; his prepared remarks referenced “my predecessor” 13 times as Biden seized the bully pulpit, one of the advantages of incumbency.In the very opening of his speech, he referred to “my predecessor” while lambasting the former president for his statement about encouraging Russia to invade NATO members who don’t meet defense spending targets.Shortly after, he went after election lies following the 2020 election as the “gravest threat to democracy” since the Civil War.By then, a pattern had emerged: on abortion, immigration, taxes and more, Biden repeatedly made the contrast with Trump, with Democrats in the audience backing him up with cheers.It was as clear a sign as any of how Biden views the upcoming general election campaign, with nothing less than the future of American democracy on the ballot. And even as he works to tout his own accomplishments, as important for Biden was warning what might happen should Trump return to office.State of the Union speeches are often staid affairs, with predictable lists of policies and proposals. That was not the case Thursday, as Biden frequently veered off script to ad-lib lines and parlay with Republicans.The result was the most raucous State of the Union in years, with the House chamber brimming with election year frission.The casual jousts with Republicans – over their plans on taxes, Social Security and immigration – clearly lent the president energy as he was delivering his speech. Biden seemed to have built the moments into his speech after last year’s address, when his back-and-forth with Republicans in the crowd emerged as a standout moment.The moments allowed Biden to show he was willing to engage with Republicans, but also – in his view – take apart some of their arguments.When he was interrupted by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was calling attention to the murder of nursing student Laken Riley by an undocumented immigrant, Biden responded directly by picking up one of the pins the Georgia Republican had been passing out reading “Say Her Name: Laken Riley” and using the term “illegal,” which isn’t how Democrats ordinarily describe immigrants.By now, questions over Biden’s age and fitness for office have become one of the principal backdrops to the presidential campaign. It’s one of the main reasons many Democrats say they would have preferred a different candidate.So it was unavoidable that Biden would face the issue during his State of the Union, whether he wanted to or not. Apart from the substance of his speech, how he spoke and how he looked while he was speaking were important factors in how Americans absorbed his message.The president came out fired up and gave an energetic speech that was a far cry from some of his more subdued efforts that have concerned supporters. He delivered much of the speech at high volume.Biden spent most of the last week fine-tuning and meticulously rehearsing his speech, both at the White House and at the presidential retreat Camp David. That appeared to pay off in his forceful delivery Thursday night.Aides acknowledged ahead of the speech it was a topic on voters’ minds and something the president was prepared to address, if not dwell on, in his speech.His argument on that front – that Trump is almost the same age, but with an antiquated and vengeful outlook – sought to defuse the issue and turn it around on his opponent.“When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever,” Biden said in his speech, to some laughs.He went on: “The issue facing our nation isn’t how old we are, it’s how old our ideas are,” adding later we “can’t lead with ancient ideas.”Foreign policy typically takes a backseat during State of the Union speeches; the intended audience is Congress and the American people and their concerns are usually within US borders.But for reasons not entirely within his control, Biden is a foreign policy president at a moment of deep global tensions. The Russia-Ukraine war grinds on, with the future of American assistance in doubt. And Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, prompted by the terror attacks of October 7, has generated a humanitarian crisis that is dividing Biden’s political coalition.So it was inevitable that foreign affairs would occupy a larger chunk of Biden’s time than in previous addresses, even if his aides acknowledge it’s not a topic that is always at the top of voters’ minds. It also led much of the early portion of his speech.Even before he entered the Capitol, it was evident from protests along his motorcade route at the widespread discontent over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.In his speech, Biden made clear the imperative of allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza, and announced he was directing the US military to construct a temporary port in Gaza that will allow more food, water and medicine to enter the strip.If there was one task Biden entered Thursday’s speech with, it was reminding American voters – many of whom may have tuned out the last three years – what exactly he’s been up to.Polls show many voters are still sour about the direction the country is heading, despite an economy that is by most measures roaring back from the Covid-19 years. Asked in surveys, many Americans have little idea of the accomplishments Biden has been working on that have helped bring the economy back.That is part of why Biden, in his speech, refers to “the greatest comeback story never told” — part brushback against what he views as persistently negative media coverage, part an acknowledgement he could do more to explain his agenda to everyday Americans.At the same time, Biden’s team acknowledges there’s a balance to be struck, and that Americans with valid concerns about the economy don’t necessarily want to be lectured about positive economic indicators they aren’t feeling themselves.That’s why Biden chose to focus heavily on populist themes, like raising tax rates on the wealthy and corporations and lowering the cost of prescription medication, which Democrats are confident will be winners.So, too, do Democrats believe showing indignation over corporate greed and price gauging will play well, particularly as cost of living concerns continue to drag down Biden’s poll numbers.This story has been updated with additional developments."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Sen. Katie Britt, a Republican from Alabama, gave the GOP rebuttal immediately following President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Thursday night. Her speech is below, as prepared for delivery and released by House Speaker Mike Johnson’s office:Good evening, America.My name is Katie Britt, and I have the honor of serving the people of the great state of Alabama in the United States Senate.However, that’s not the job that matters most.I’m a proud wife and mom of two school-aged kids. My daughter, Bennett, and my son, Ridgeway, are why I ran for the Senate.I am worried about their future – and the future of children in every corner of our nation. That’s why I invited you into our home tonight.Like so many families across America, my husband, Wesley, and I just watched President Biden’s State of the Union Address from our living room. What we saw was the performance of a permanent politician who has actually been in office for longer than I’ve even been alive.One thing was clear: President Biden just doesn’t get it. He’s out of touch. Under his Administration, families are worse off. Our communities are less safe, and our country is less secure.I wish he understood what real families are facing around kitchen tables just like this.This is where our family has tough conversations and where we make hard decisions. It’s where we share the good, the bad, and the ugly of our days. It’s where we laugh together. It’s where we hold each other’s hands and pray for God’s guidance. And, many nights, it’s where Wesley and I worry.I know we’re not alone. Tonight, the American family needs to have a tough conversation, because the truth is, we’re all worried about the future of our nation.The country we know and love seems to be slipping away. It feels like the next generation will have fewer opportunities – and less freedom – than we did. I worry my own children may not even get a shot at living their American Dreams.My American Dream allowed me, the daughter of two small business owners from rural Enterprise, Alabama, to be elected to the U.S. Senate at the age of 40.Growing up sweeping the floor at my dad’s hardware store and cleaning the bathroom at my mom’s dance studio, I never could have imagined what my story would entail.To think what the American Dream can do across just one generation, in just one lifetime, is truly breathtaking.But right now, the American Dream has turned into a nightmare for so many families.The true, unvarnished State of our Union begins and ends with this: Our families are hurting. Our country can do better.And you don’t have to look any further than the crisis at our southern border to see it. President Biden inherited the most secure border of all-time. But minutes after taking office, he suspended all deportations, halted construction of the border wall, and announced a plan to give amnesty to millions.We know that President Biden didn’t just create this border crisis. He invited it with 94 executive actions in his first 100 days.When I first took office, I did something different. I traveled to the Del Rio sector of Texas, where I spoke to a woman who shared her story with me. She had been sex trafficked by the cartels starting at age 12. She told me not just that she was raped every day, but how many times a day she was raped.The cartels put her on a mattress in a shoe-box of a room, and they sent men through that door, over and over again, for hours and hours on-end.We wouldn’t be OK with this happening in a third-world country. This is the United States of America, and it’s past time we start acting like it.President Biden’s border crisis is a disgrace. It’s despicable. And it’s almost entirely preventable.From fentanyl poisonings to horrific murders… There are empty chairs tonight at kitchen tables just like this one because of President Biden’s senseless border policies.Just think about Laken Riley. In my neighboring state of Georgia, this beautiful, 22-year-old nursing student went out on a jog one morning. But she never got the opportunity to return home. She was brutally murdered by one of the millions of illegal border crossers President Biden chose to release into our homeland.That could’ve been my daughter. It could’ve been yours.Tonight, President Biden finally said her name. But he refused to take responsibility for his own actions.Mr. President, enough is enough. Innocent Americans are dying. And you only have yourself to blame. Fulfill your oath of office. Reverse your policies. End this crisis. And stop the suffering.Sadly, we know President Biden’s failures don’t stop there.His reckless spending dug our economy into a hole and sent the cost-of-living through the roof.The worst inflation in 40 years. The highest credit card debt in history.Hardworking families are struggling to make ends meet today. And with soaring mortgage rates and sky-high childcare costs, they’re also struggling to plan for tomorrow.The American people are scraping by while the President proudly proclaims Bidenomics is working!Bless his heart. We know better.I’ll never forget stopping at a gas station in Chilton County one evening. The gentleman working the counter told me that after retiring, he had to pick up that job in his 70s so he didn’t have to choose between going hungry or going without his medication. He said, “I did everything right, everything I was told to do – I worked hard, I saved, I was responsible.”He’s not alone. I hear similar concerns from fellow parents when I’m walking with my friends or at one my kids’ games.But let’s be honest – it’s been a minute since Joe Biden pumped gas, ran carpool, or pushed a grocery cart. Meanwhile, the rest of us see every day that our dollar doesn’t go as far.And despite what he tells you, our communities are not safer.For years, the left has coddled criminals and defunded the police – all while letting repeat offenders walk free.The result is tragic but foreseeable—from our small towns to America’s most iconic city streets, life is getting more and more dangerous.Unfortunately, President Biden’s weakness isn’t just hurting families here at home. He’s making us a punchline on the world stage.Where I’m from, your word is your bond. But for three years, this President has demonstrated that America’s word doesn’t mean what it used to.From abandoning allies in his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan… to desperately pushing another dangerous deal with Iran, President Biden has failed.We’ve become a nation in retreat. And the enemies of freedom see an opportunity.Putin’s brutal aggression in Europe has put our allies on the brink.Iran’s terrorist proxies have slaughtered Israeli Jews and American citizens. They’ve targeted commercial shipping. And they’ve attacked our troops nearly 200 times since October, killing three U.S. soldiers and two Navy SEALS.Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party is undercutting America’s workers. China is buying up our farmland, spying on our military installations, and spreading propaganda through the likes of TikTok.The CCP knows that if it conquers the minds of our next generation, it conquers America.And what does President Biden do? He bans TikTok for government employees, but creates an account for his own campaign. You can’t make this stuff up!Look, we all recall when Presidents faced national security threats with strength and resolve.That seems like ancient history. Right now, our Commander in Chief is not in command.The free world deserves better than a dithering and diminished leader.America deserves leaders who recognize that secure borders, stable prices, safe streets, and a strong defense are the cornerstones of a great nation.Just ask yourself, are you better off now than you were three years ago?There is no doubt we’re at a crossroads. We all feel it.But here’s the good news: we the People are still in the driver’s seat. We get to decide whether our future will grow brighter, or whether we settle for an America in decline.Well, I know which choice our children deserve – and the choice the Republican Party is fighting for.We are the Party of hardworking parents and families. We want to give you and your children the opportunities to thrive – and we want families to grow. It’s why we strongly support continued nationwide access to invitro fertilization. We want to help loving moms and dads bring precious life into this world. Wesley and I believe there is no greater blessing in life than our children.And that’s why tonight, I want to make a direct appeal to the parents out there – and in particular, to my fellow moms.Many of whom will be tossing and turning at 2 am wondering how they are going to be three places at once tomorrow and somehow still get dinner on the table.First of all, we see you, we hear you, and we stand with you.I know you’re frustrated. I know you’re probably disgusted by most of what you see going on in Washington. And I’ll be really honest with you – you’re not wrong for feeling that way.Look, I get it. The task in front of us isn’t an easy one. But I can promise you one thing: it is worth it. So, I am asking you, for the sake of your kids and your grandkids, get into the arena.Every generation has been called to do hard things. American greatness rests in the fact that we always answer that call.It’s who we are.Never forget, we’re steeped in the blood of patriots who overthrew the most powerful empire in the world.We walk in the footsteps of pioneers who tamed the wild.We now carry forward the same flame of freedom as the liberators of an oppressed Europe.We draw courage from those who bent the moral arc of the universe.And when we gaze upon the heavens, never forget that our DNA contains the same ingenuity that put man on the Moon.America has been tested before, and every single time, we’ve emerged unbowed and unbroken.Our history has been written with the grit of men and women who got knocked down. But we know their stories because they did not stay down. We are here because they stood back up.So now it’s our turn – our moment to stand up and prove ourselves worthy of protecting the American Dream.Together, we can reawaken the heroic spirit of a great nation.Because Americans don’t just have a rendezvous with destiny – we take destiny’s hand, and we lead it.Our future starts around kitchen tables just like this. With moms and dads just like you.And you are why I believe with every fiber of my being that despite the current State of our Union, our best days are still ahead.May God bless you, and may God continue to bless these United States of America."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The New York judge overseeing Donald Trump’s criminal trial beginning later this month agreed to limit access to juror information, citing the possibility of harassment.Judge Juan Merchan granted motions by prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney’s office to restrict who can know the names of jurors to Trump, the attorneys, staff and consultants in the case, forbidding them from being shared with anyone else.Merchan said he found “compelling” prosecutors’ argument that Trump has a history of publicly attacking jurors involved in other cases.The judge also said he would limit who can have knowledge of jurors addresses to only the attorneys in the case, making clear that Trump and anyone else cannot know where the jurors live or work.“The Court further finds good cause, on the record before it, ‘that there is a likelihood of bribery, jury tampering, or of physical injury or harassment of juror(s),’” Merchan wrote, quoting the legal standard.The judge said, at Trump’s request, he would “take reasonable precautions,” such as not disclosing these protective orders to the jurors so it would not prejudice or reflect badly on Trump.The judge has not yet ruled on prosecutors’ request for a gag order in the case, but he did remind the attorneys and Trump in the written order of his previous instruction that they should refrain from making statements that could incite violence or civil unrest.He added, “Access to the courtroom by the public and the press will not be tempered in any way as a result of these protective measures.”Prosecutors asked the judge to limit Trump from knowing too much about the jurors.“Defendant’s conduct in this and other matters – including his extensive history of attacking jurors in other proceedings – presents a significant risk of juror harassment and intimidation that warrants reasonable protective measures to ensure the integrity of these proceedings, minimize obstacles to jury selection, and protect juror safety,” prosecutors said in their motion."

        "text": "Former GOP Rep. George Santos, who was expelled from the House last year and is facing federal charges, announced Thursday night that he’s running for Congress again — this time to challenge a Republican congressman in New York.“Tonight, I want to announce that I will be returning to the arena of politics and challenging Nick for the battle over #NY1,” Santos wrote on X, referring to GOP Rep. Nick LaLota. “I look forward to debating him on the issues and on his weak record as a Republican. The fight for our majority is imperative for the survival of the country.”The former congressman, who had represented New York’s 3rd District, made his announcement during President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Thursday — during which he was spotted at the US Capitol.Santos enters a battleground contest in New York that’s among several races in the state that could decide the House majority – though he’ll face steep odds for his comeback bid, even setting aside his personal baggage, in challenging an incumbent in a June primary.LaLota quickly hit back at Santos’ new bid Thursday night. “To raise the standard in Congress, and to hold a pathological liar who stole an election accountable, I led the charge to expel George Santos. If finishing the job requires beating him in a primary, count me in,” LaLota said.LaLota had introduced a resolution to expel his fellow New York Republican last fall, saying that he deserved “to be in prison.”In his announcement for his new campaign, Santos called his former colleague a RINO, or Republican in Name Only. “New York hasn’t had a real conservative represent them since I left office arbitrarily, thanks to RINO, empty suits like @nicklalota,” he wrote on X.A crowded field of Democrats has assembled to try to flip New York’s 1st District, which is rated Lean Republican by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales.John Avlon, a former CNN commentator, and Nancy Goroff, a professor emeritus at Stony Brook University who lost a bid for the House in 2020, are among the lead contenders on the Democratic side.“Bring it on,” Avlon said in a statement Thursday night responding to Santos’ new campaign.The Santos for Congress campaign also filed organization paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday night, stating his intention to run in the 1st District. The campaign’s new filing identified the return of a treasurer who previously worked for Santos.Santos is the sixth lawmaker ever to be expelled from the chamber. He has separately pleaded not guilty to 23 federal charges, including allegations of fraud related to Covid-19 unemployment benefits, misusing campaign funds and lying about his personal finances on House disclosure reports.This story has been updated with additional information.CNN’s Haley Talbot contributed to this report."

        "title": "Why November could decide Senate control for years",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "For Senate Democrats, 2024 is the year of living dangerously.In this fall’s Senate elections, Democrats will be defending more seats in precarious political terrain than in any other election during the 2020s. That list of challenging elections this year includes the final three Senate seats Democrats hold in states that voted for Donald Trump in 2020, and five more in states that President Joe Biden won by 3 percentage points or less. Meanwhile, Republicans this year are not defending any Senate seats in states that voted against Trump in 2020, or preferred him by 3 points or less.That math underlines the stakes for Democrats in Biden improving his position in the key swing states by November. One of the most powerful trends of modern Senate elections is that it has become exceedingly difficult for candidates in either party to win seats in states that usually vote the other way for president.The Senate Democrats running in difficult electoral terrain might break that trend this fall. Yet if they can’t, Biden’s fate in November could determine control of the Senate not only in 2025, but for years thereafter.A strong recovery by Biden in which he wins most of the key swing states could position Democrats to remain competitive in the battle for Senate control through the remainder of this decade, even if they narrowly lose the majority in November. But if Biden loses most of the swing states, Democrats could fall into a Senate deficit too large to realistically overcome for years — especially because the party has so few plausible opportunities to flip seats now held by the GOP.“If the bottom were to drop out for Biden, Democrats could lose the Senate for a long time,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the political newsletter “Sabato’s Crystal Ball,” which is published by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.That prospect has enormous implications not only for the passage of legislation but also for the composition of the federal courts, especially the Supreme Court. Four of the Supreme Court justices will be older than 70 by 2028. Even if Biden holds the White House in 2024, and a vacancy arises, a durable Republican Senate majority might refuse to fill any of those seats — just as then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did while Barack Obama was president in 2016. “You can imagine Supreme Court seats going unfilled for years,” Kondik said.The default position for the Senate in the 21st century has been for small and fleeting majorities. In the 12 congressional sessions since 2001, one party or the other has reached 55 Senate seats only three times. By comparison, one party or the other won a majority of 55 or more Senate seats seven times in the 10 sessions from 1980 to 2000. Smaller majorities, not surprisingly, have proved more difficult to defend: In this century, control of the Senate has already flipped in the elections of 2002, 2006, 2014 and 2020.The principal reason the chamber has become so closely divided is the growing correlation between how states vote for president and how they vote for the Senate. That has limited the number of Senate seats each side can win absent unusual circumstances.Through the late 20th century, it was common for voters to split their tickets by electing senators from one party while voting for the presidential nominee of the other. After the 1984 election, for instance, Democrats still held about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for Ronald Reagan in both of his winning presidential campaigns.But now the alignment between presidential and Senate outcomes has become nearly complete. Heading into the 2024 election, Republicans hold 47 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Trump in 2020. Democrats, in turn, hold 48 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Biden last time.This surface equivalence in the two parties’ position in the Senate, though, masks a deeper divergence that largely explains the risk to Democrats this year.While Biden and Trump each won 25 states in 2020, Biden won far more of them by very narrow margins. As a result, Senate Democrats are much more dependent than Republicans on states that lean their way only slightly in the presidential contest.In 2020, Biden won three states by less than a single percentage point: Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. He won three others by less than 3 percentage points: Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan. Democrats now hold 11 of the 12 Senate seats from those six highly competitive states. (Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is the only Republican senator from these states.)By contrast, among the 25 states that backed Trump, North Carolina — where Republicans hold both Senate seats — was the only one Trump carried by less than 3 percentage points. Even extending the net to states Trump won by less than 5 percentage points brings in only Florida, where Republicans also hold both Senate seats.This contrast creates a huge disparity between the parties. Democrats now hold 14 inherently vulnerable Senate seats: their three from the states Trump won in 2020, and their 11 in the states Biden won only narrowly. For Republicans the total is at most six: two in states that Biden won in 2020, and four in states that Trump won narrowly, even with Florida included.“When you have so many states where it is now inconceivable that they could go the other way, Democrats always have to get a straight flush,” said Michael Podhorzer, the former political director for the AFL-CIO. “They’ve got to run the table, because on the basis of what’s safe on either side in the Senate, or the Electoral College, they are at a huge disadvantage.”This year Democrats are defending five of their 11 seats in the states that Biden won by 3 points or less. That’s the biggest concentration of seats from those states Democrats must defend in any single election in this decade, from 2020 through 2028.This year’s Senate races in the narrow Biden states include Democratic incumbents Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, and Jacky Rosen in Nevada; also on the ballot is an open Democratic-held seat in Michigan (where the party is very likely to nominate Rep. Elissa Slotkin) and the Arizona seat held by Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sinema hasn’t indicated whether she will seek reelection, but Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is already running for the seat. (Democrats also face an unexpected challenge in Maryland — a state that leans much more reliably toward them in presidential elections — after GOP former Gov. Larry Hogan last week said he would run for the open seat there.)In addition, Democrats this year must defend all three of their remaining Senate seats in the states that voted for Trump in 2020. That includes incumbents Jon Tester in Montana, Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and the open seat being vacated by the retiring Joe Manchin in West Virginia. Neither of the two remaining Senate Republicans in states that Biden won last time (Susan Collins in Maine and Johnson in Wisconsin) are up this year; nor are either of the GOP senators from North Carolina, the state Trump won by his smallest margin.Both parties agree the open West Virginia seat is virtually guaranteed to flip to the GOP. Tester and Brown both have strong personal brands, but Biden is almost certain to lose their states, and possibly by substantial margins. If he does, Brown and Tester could survive only by breaking a nearly inviolate recent pattern in presidential election years.In 2016, for the first time ever, every Senate race was won by the same party that carried the presidential contest in that state. In 2020, every Senate race again followed the presidential outcome — except in Maine, where Collins won reelection despite Biden’s victory there.This pattern proved especially frustrating to Democrats, who raised enormous sums in 2020 for Senate candidates in Republican-leaning states such as Kentucky, South Carolina, Iowa, Kansas, Montana and Texas. Yet when Trump comfortably carried those states in November, all of those Democratic Senate candidates lost as well.This year, with West Virginia likely already gone, if either Brown or Tester loses, it would be very difficult for Democrats to maintain their Senate majority into 2025. The only Republican senators they might plausibly oust to offset those losses are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas. Democrats have recruited strong challengers to each of them, but both of those races clearly lean toward the GOP, especially in a presidential election year.But if Democrats can hold down their Senate losses to some (or even all) of their three seats in the states Trump won in 2020, they would emerge with a deficit small enough to overcome in upcoming elections. The real long-term risk for the party this November is losing several of their Senate seats in the states Biden narrowly carried last time. (Hogan’s bid in Maryland adds a wild card, but the probability that Biden wins Maryland will likely leave Hogan as an underdog despite his personal popularity.)If Democrats lose Senate seats in the narrow Biden states, they simply have very few places on the map to replace them, given the parties’ patterns of support. It’s that prospect that has led the Democratic data analyst David Shor to warn for years that if the party doesn’t perform well in the 2024 presidential election, the GOP could seize control of the Senate for a sustained period.Shor would not comment on the Democrats’ Senate situation, but many other analysts see a dangerous convergence: The party must defend an unusually large number of seats in terrain that is highly contested at the presidential level precisely as Biden is struggling in polls against Trump. “There is a real downside risk that if the presidential election goes poorly, the Republicans could not only win the Senate but build something of a cushion that would be hard for Democrats to cut into in the near future,” Kondik said.Gene Ulm, a Republican pollster who has worked for many Senate candidates, agrees that what happens in the narrow Biden 2020 states this fall will cast a huge shadow on control of the Senate through the decade. If Republicans capture Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, he said, the reaction in the political world would not be “gosh, shock, alert the media,” he said.“It’s one thing for Republicans to recapture those states that have been habitually red,” Ulm said, but “if all of a sudden you have Republicans winning places that are historically purple,” that creates a very different situation going forward.The best-case scenario for Democrats is that Biden recovers enough to win most or all of the five battleground states where the party is also defending Senate seats. Many on both sides agree that it will be difficult for Republicans to flip any of those Democratic-held seats if Biden wins the state — with Arizona a possible exception if Sinema creates a three-way race.Of the Democrats running in the narrow Biden states, Casey in Pennsylvania and Baldwin in Wisconsin are probably best positioned to win even the president he loses their state, many in both parties agree. Brown and Tester also have deep roots that could allow them to survive Biden defeats as well. But in this era of greater party-line voting, it won’t be easy for any candidate to overcome such an undertow: Hardly any Senate Democrats in competitive races ran even 2 percentage points ahead of Biden’s vote share in 2020.Ulm sees two keys to the Senate outcomes in the competitive swing states. One is the choices in the Senate races by voters who back third-party presidential candidates out of distaste for both Biden and Trump, assuming they face each other again; it is very difficult at this point, Ulm said, to predict how those disaffected voters will vote in Senate (and House) races.For Ulm, the other key question is what happens with the voters who are slightly negative about Biden. He is confident Republican Senate candidates will romp among voters who strongly disapprove of Biden, as they did in 2022. But one reason Democrats blunted the anticipated 2022 red wave is their congressional and gubernatorial candidates ran unusually well among voters who only “somewhat disapproved” of Biden — largely because many of those voters considered the Trump-allied GOP alternatives too extreme.That risk to the GOP remains. “The soft disapprovers are going to be a much more competitive constituency, just like 2022,” Ulm said.David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, notes that in the 2022 midterm election, Democrats won Senate races in most of these same battleground states, although exit polls showed substantial discontent with the economy and Biden’s performance then, too. “Senate campaigns are candidate versus candidate battles,” Bergstein said. “We have the superior candidates, and Republicans are putting forward candidates who have big flaws, who lost races before, or are facing the prospect of damaging primaries. Certainly a presidential cycle is different than a midterm, but the laws of Senate campaigns, where candidate quality matters, are still in effect.”Gary Jacobson, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of California at San Diego who specializes in Congress, said that given the fissures opening in each party’s coalition during the Trump era, no one should rule out the possibility that either side may develop new opportunities that reconfigure the Senate’s precarious balance.“This structural disadvantage the Democrats have is a real thing and it will make it an uphill battle for them to control the Senate for the foreseeable future,” Jacobson said. “But the foreseeable future is pretty short. Political configurations are not cut in stone.”Unless and until such a new political configuration emerges, both parties can realistically target many fewer Senate seats than they could even two decades ago. But the ceiling is clearly lower for Democrats than for Republicans. It leaves Democrats, even in good years, with achingly little margin for error to build a Senate majority. And unless Biden recovers more strength, 2024 may be very far from anything Democrats would call a good year."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Joy Rendulic was hesitant when her husband first suggested a move to South Carolina. Then she visited a small ice cream shop for sale near the spectacular coast of this barrier island town.Rendulic cashed in her 401(k) to buy it, and left Erie, Pennsylvania, behind.“God brought me here,” Rendulic told us during a break at Island Treats ice cream shop. “I thought I was doing what I was supposed to be doing for the rest of my life, and he had a different plan. We think we are in control. But we’re not.”The big move was in 2016. Nikki Haley was the governor then, and newcomer Rendulic was impressed.“Yes, she was a very good governor,” Rendulic said.Donald Trump won her vote for president that same year, again in 2020 and will once more when Trump and Haley square off in the South Carolina GOP presidential primary this month.“I totally believe that God has assigned him to this position,” Rendulic said of Trump. “That is my true belief.”We ask what happened in 2020.“That was a mess,” Rendulic said. “That was so illegal. Some improper cheating happening to the voting procedures.”We mention all the recounts and court cases Trump lost, including cases decided by judges Trump appointed, that upheld now-President Joe Biden’s victory.“I think so many people hate Trump,” she said. “I just know there was a whole lot of cheating.”There is no evidence of that, but Rendulic is adamant.So we ask, if it was God’s plan for Trump to be president, why would God let that happen?The answer is halting.“What happened is what happened. And I believe Trump is coming again.”Rendulic represents an important slice of the Trump base: for Trump no matter what. These voters echo his false claims about rigged elections and bogus investigations and they stand by Trump even when he does things counter to their priorities. You find a lot of them in South Carolina, one reason Trump consistently leads the primary polls despite Haley’s home state status.Rendulic, for example, lists abortion – or the “right to life,” as she puts it – as the reason her last vote for a Democrat for president was Jimmy Carter. But she offers no criticism of Trump when we point out he has recently criticized some state abortion restrictions as too harsh and has warned it could be a losing issue for Republicans.“I haven’t thought about that too much, probably,” Rendulic said. “I want it to be right to life.”No doubt Trump gets her vote.“He’s even more ready now and very, very intelligent, cares a lot about this country,” she said. “Wants to do what is right.”Billy Pierce is another piece of the Trump comeback puzzle.He has lived in Hartsville – about two hours inland from the South Carolina coast – all his 70 years except for a stint in the Navy.Pierce says he was drawn to Trump in 2016 for the same reason he backed Ross Perot in 1992.“I wanted a non-career politician in there that would do, would run it like a company,” Pierce said in an interview in the garage office where he organizes his part-time consulting work.Pierce sees Biden as too unwilling to stand up to the Democratic left and has fond memories of the pre-Covid economy during the Trump administration.“We didn’t have the high inflation,” he said. “We didn’t have the high interest rates.”Pierce is not an election denier. He does believe it was wrong that many states adopted new voting rules during the 2020 pandemic, but said Trump should have honored the results once all his challenges were exhausted.Nor is Pierce a fan of the former president’s toxic tone.“If he’d just shut up and, you know, got off Twitter and that kind of stuff, he’d have made a great president,” Pierce said.He called himself a likely Trump voter in the primary and described the choice between Trump and Haley as “the lesser of two evils.”But Pierce is very much in line with Trump on policy matters.“He’s going to fix the things I need him to fix,” Pierce said, listing the border as his top priority.“Shut it down,” is Pierce’s desire, though he agrees with Trump that congressional Republicans should not pass a border package before the November election – even if it would slow the flow of illegal border crossings. “This is a Democratic ploy” designed to help Biden, Pierce said.He offers a suggestion on what he would do at the border, based on his time in the military.“Have us put up razor wire,” Pierce said. “I have no problem with putting up two rows and mining the other. So if they come in, you tell them it is mined. You put signs out there that says it’s mined.”He balances such tough talk with a personal story about his daughter adopting two children from Guatemala. Be tough at the border now, Pierce said, and then conversations about more legal immigration would be possible. “It needs to be done the right way.”Craig Thomas lived in Tennessee when Trump caught his attention in 2016.Thomas describes himself as “conservative, some areas libertarian.”Trump, he thought then, was an outsider – and a vote for him would send a message to Washington.“It was like, alright, like this is good,” said Thomas. “Let’s blow some things up.”Now, Thomas lives in Charleston and is voting for Haley – to send a message to his two children.He is tired of all the personal attacks and all the anger and wants a president who is also a role model. Haley, he said, “brings very similar policy positions, but definitely without the drama.”One recent MAGA conspiracy theory hit too close to home.“I don’t think there’s any sort of a crazy conspiracy between the NFL and Taylor Swift and everything else just showing up for a Biden coronation,” Thomas said. “How do I look at my daughter, who is a huge Taylor Swift fan, and this guy just attacking Taylor Swift, just because she is going to support another candidate, right.”“And other things like that. And having those conversations with them. It does matter. And it does matter who you support.”Charleston is rich with both Revolutionary and Civil War history, a place where you can still ride a horse-drawn carriage down a cobblestone street. It is more affluent, more educated and less Trumpy than most of South Carolina.“But there is quite a bit of talk about Trump, even here,” Thomas said.Mark Sanford is out of politics because of that – because of the reach of the Trump Republican revolution.Sanford served in the House representing a Charleston-area district, and then was the state’s two-term Republican governor just before Haley was first elected in 2010. Sanford won his old House seat back in 2013, but then lost the Republican primary in 2018 because he was a sharp critic of then-President Trump’s fiscal policies, and sometimes of his tone.“I would say, ‘Well I’m for Trump in this area, but I’m against in these different areas.’ But people didn’t want nuance. They want: ‘Are you for or against him.’”Sanford wouldn’t directly answer when asked how he will vote in this month’s primary.But he did offer this: “I’ve never voted for Trump so far. I know that I’m not voting for him this time. I’ll let you read the tea leaves from that.”Sanford agrees when Haley goes after Trump for all the “chaos,” and especially when she highlights the deficit spending of the Trump years. Yet he expects a big Trump win in South Carolina, because the GOP electorate is so different now from when he was first elected.“What has traditionally worked in GOP politics isn’t so much working these days,” he said in an interview at his home in the Charleston suburb of Mount Pleasant. “He became sort of a proxy litmus test for ‘Are you for or against the system,’” Sanford said.“I’ve seen this erosion,” Sanford said. “Sort of Perot movement to Tea Party to Trump. It’s metastasized in ever aggressive forms. And what started out as a lot of well meaning Americans saying, ‘Look, we’ve got to do something about politicians doing what they said they were going to do’ (has evolved) into something much more strident. … It is their religion. I mean, I, I don’t know how else to explain it.”"

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "When President Joe Biden returns to the House chamber to deliver his third State of the Union address, the former longtime senator will address his onetime congressional colleagues as a guest.The president is invited to address Congress by the House speaker, in accordance with his constitutional duty to “from time to time” deliver a message outlining top issues facing Americans and plans to solve those issues. House Speaker Mike Johnson invited Biden in a letter on January 6. The address will take place this year on Thursday, March 7.Two seats on the dais behind the president are reserved for the vice president and the House speaker. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is also the president of the Senate, will sit to the right behind Biden, and Johnson will be seated to his left.Presidents and first ladies typically invite about two dozen guests to sit in the House gallery. State of the Union guests help put a human face to a president’s message for both policymakers and viewers at home.The president’s Cabinet, Supreme Court justices who choose to attend, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, former members of Congress and members of the diplomatic corps are seated in front of lawmakers.House members aren’t assigned seats. Instead, seats in the chamber are doled out on a first come, first served basis the day of the speech. House members must stay seated in the spot they choose until the address begins, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service.Senators join their House colleagues in the chamber, sitting at the front, the report from the Congressional Research Service states.The 535 members of Congress are each granted one guest ticket. The Sergeant at Arms handles seating for the guests, who fill up the remainder of the gallery.A number of the family members of the remaining Israeli-American hostages in Gaza plan to attend the address at the invitation of members of Congress, a source familiar told CNN.Lawmakers are not required to sit separately based on political party, but they do make their parties known by how they cheer — or jeer — throughout the president’s speech.Democrats, aligned with Biden’s agenda, will likely stand up, clap and sit back down many, many times during the speech. Republicans, however, will likely do so sparingly.The guest list for first lady Dr. Jill Biden’s box offers a blueprint for the president’s address as he leans on personal stories to put faces to critical issues facing Americans.The first lady is expected to invite Kate Cox, the Texas mother of two who had to leave her state to seek an abortion to end a life-threatening pregnancy, as her guest to the address. Maria Shriver, the journalist and women’s health advocate, will also be present. Shriver, who is a cousin of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., teamed up with the first lady to launch the White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research.As Biden highlights a series of executive actions around the prevention of gun violence, Jazmin Cazares of Uvalde, Texas, will be in the first lady’s box. Cazares’ sister, Jackie, was killed at the massacre at Robb Elementary School, and Jazmin has spent the time since “traveling across the country and sharing Jackie’s story,” the White House said.The White House invited Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, to attend the address as a guest of the president and first lady, but she was unable to attend, two White House officials said. The White House also confirmed that it had extended an invitation to Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska to attend the address but that she declined the invitation."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The Joe Biden vs. Donald Trump rematch is a presumptive reality after the president and former president both dominated Republican and Democratic primaries on Super Tuesday.The flaws, general unpopularity and baked-in perceptions of both candidates suggest the coming election will be one of mutually assured destruction, where Republicans try to make Biden seem as old and feeble as possible and Democrats equate a second Trump term with the end of democracy as we know it.If 2024 is anything like 2020 (or 2016, for that matter), the Republican or Democratic winner will eke past the loser in a handful of key states – which means third-party or independent candidates, even though they have little chance of winning such a hotly contested election, could play an important role in deciding the outcome.Third parties. The Libertarian Party has been on the ballot in every state in recent elections. The Green Party is usually on the ballot in most but not all states. Those parties have not traditionally drawn large followings, but in elections with close margins, the tens of thousands of votes they win in key states in any given year lead to a lot of speculation.It has been argued that stronger Libertarian and Green Party tickets in 2016, led by former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, respectively, sucked support from Hillary Clinton and helped elect Trump. There was similar grousing with regard to the Green Party’s Ralph Nader in Florida in 2000.But most in-depth assessments conclude that it’s not realistic to assume third-party voters would simply opt for a major-party candidate if the third-party option was not available. The Libertarian Party will pick a nominee at a party convention in May. The Green Party will pick its candidate in July.Independent candidates. This year, there is a different kind of wild card than in 2020, when the rapper Kanye West ran for president. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a famous name, a history in politics and deep-pocketed supporters helping him get on November ballots as an independent. The academic and social justice advocate Cornel West is also running as an independent and formed a new party: Justice for All.No Labels. Sensing frustration with the major parties, No Labels formed as a centrist group, not a political party, that set about seeking ballot access for an unnamed “unity” candidate. No such candidate has emerged, at least not yet. No Labels members will vote this week on whether or not to seek a candidate.The group has recently suggested that if it does field a ticket, it would search for a Republican presidential candidate and Democratic vice presidential candidate. Key moderate figures like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia have said they will not run.No Labels chief strategist Ryan Clancy did not name any particular candidate who could serve as a No Labels candidate during an interview with CNN’s Abby Phillip on Wednesday. He said the group’s members, which are not publicly known, would be deciding what’s next for the group.“What you’ll get on Friday is you’ll get news on whether we’re going to be going forward. And then if we are indeed going forward, you will hear in short order in the coming weeks of the process by which that ticket would get chosen,” Clancy said.A main hurdle for independent candidates is getting on the ballot.Just ask Kanye West, whose weird 2020 campaign only got about 70,000 votes in 18 states. It was a telling development that people aligned with the Trump campaign helped West get on the ballot in the swing state of Wisconsin, clearly hoping he would siphon votes away from Biden.Here’s the current state of Kennedy’s effort to get the signatures to appear on ballots, which is being aided by the well-funded super PAC that supports him:► Nevada and New Hampshire are swing states where Kennedy’s campaign claims to have enough signatures. Add in the blue state of Hawaii.► The super PAC that supports him claims to have enough signatures to get him on the ballot in the key states of Arizona and Georgia.► He’s already on the ballot in red state of Utah.Cornel West’s campaign says it is on the ballot in three states so far: Alaska, Oregon and South Carolina.It’s complicated and in flux.A February poll by Marquette University found that in a head-to-head matchup, Trump had 51% to Biden’s 49%.When Kennedy, West and the Green Party’s Stein were added into the question, things changed. Trump was still on top with 42%, Biden got 39%, Kennedy had 15%, West had 3% and Stein had 2%.Kennedy pulled more support from Republicans in that poll, while West and Stein pulled more support from Democrats. Trump maintained a higher portion of independents than Biden when independents were included.When I asked CNN polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy how to view these polls, she pointed out that polls that explicitly ask about third-party candidates by name tend to overstate the level of support they actually end up taking. There are reasons to suspect that’s particularly likely in the case of Kennedy, who could be benefiting to some extent from a combination of dissatisfaction with Biden and Trump and the value of his name recognition, which doesn’t necessarily indicate durable support for his candidacy.Buzzy independent candidates have a tendency to lose support as Election Day nears. Think Ross Perot, the most successful recent independent or third-party candidate, who did not break 20% in the national popular vote and won no states or electoral votes. He may very well have helped elect Bill Clinton, the Democrat who won the White House with just 43% of the national vote in 1992.Democrats. They have actively opposed the No Labels campaign since its inception, warning that it would draw support from Biden.And they have lodged complaints about coordination between Kennedy’s campaign and the super PAC that supports him and is gathering signatures on his behalf.If you want to know why Kennedy’s candidacy is concerning to Democrats, watch Eva McKend’s report after Kennedy held an event with Black voters in New York.Kennedy has also flirted with the idea of running as a Libertarian. He spoke to the state party convention in California, for instance. But it would be an odd fit for a Kennedy – who still holds notably liberal views on some key issues and made his career as an environmental activist – to join the Libertarian Party.“Libertarians are like wet cats. They’re very difficult to herd, and they don’t like to be told by rich, famous outsiders that they need to vote for their candidates,” Matt Welch, the editor at large of the Libertarian magazine Reason told CNN’s Michael Smerconish last week.But Welch predicted that Kennedy has raised enough money to hire signature gatherers and lawyers needed to get on the presidential ballot as an independent candidate in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia.Definitely read Jake Tapper’s story on his interactions with Kennedy about Kennedy’s vaccination claims. Or watch the candidate’s interaction with CNN’s Kasie Hunt where she rolls the tape to jog his memory on his claim that no vaccines are safe.And expect Kennedy’s opponents, particularly on the liberal side of the political aisle, to spend some time and money reintroducing people to his conspiracy-minded views on vaccines and other topics."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Special counsel Jack Smith is forcefully opposing former President Donald Trump’s sweeping claim of presidential immunity in the criminal case over his handling of classified documents, urging the judge to cut off Trump’s ability to appeal the issue in a way that would delay his trial.The “immunity claim here is so wholly without merit that it is difficult to understand it except as part of a strategic effort for delay,” Smith’s office wrote in one of a host of legal filings Thursday afternoon.Trump is charged with taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and resisting the government’s attempts to retrieve the materials. He has pleaded not guilty.The indictment against Trump in Florida, prosecutors said, “does not charge Trump for any acts that he undertook as President, let alone an official presidential act.”Smith’s office asked Judge Aileen Cannon to certify Trump’s new immunity claim as “frivolous,” which would foreclose the former president’s avenue for an immediate appeal that would delay the trial. An immunity claim is one of the few issues that, if appealed, could derail a trial.The timelines leading to trial have become a flashpoint in Smith’s two prosecutions.Trump’s presidential immunity claim in his separate January 6, 2021-related federal case, which is largely about actions he took while president, wasn’t deemed to be frivolous by the courts, and his case has been on hold for weeks while the courts consider the issue. The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments for April 25.In separate court filings Thursday, Smith responded to Trump’s other arguments for dismissing the classified documents case, including allegations of selective and vindictive prosecution as well as claims that the former president was allowed to take classified material to his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House and that the special counsel was unlawfully appointed.Cannon set a hearing for March 14, and told the parties to “reserve a full day for argument” on two motions from the defendants covering their argument that Trump was legally allowed to take classified material to his Mar-a-Lago residence.Smith pushed back strongly on Trump’s claim that he’s the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution, and being treated differently than others who have allegedly mishandled classified material – including President Joe Biden and former Vice President Mike Pence.“He has not identified anyone who has engaged in a remotely similar battery of criminal conduct and not been prosecuted as a result,” prosecutors wrote in their filing.Smith leaned heavily on former special counsel Robert Hur’s report on Biden’s handling of classified documents, saying the Trump’s comparison between the two probes “fails.” Hur declined last month to bring charges against Biden in the matter.“Trump, unlike Biden, is alleged to have engaged in extensive and repeated efforts to obstruct justice and thwart the return of documents bearing classification markings,” the special counsel wrote.Smith said that the former president’s arguments do not satisfy the legal elements required to prevail on such a claim, which include showing that prosecutors acted with “genuine animus” toward a defendant.Instead, prosecutors said, the conduct at issue in the case made it so that “Trump ‘in effect selected [himself] for prosecution.’”Trump has also repeatedly asserted both on the campaign trail and in court that his handling of classified material is allowed under the Presidential Records Act, but prosecutors say nothing in the federal law permitted Trump to take and store classified material.“His claim that obviously presidential records — highly sensitive government documents bearing classification markings that were presented to Trump during his term in office — can be transformed into ‘personal’ records by the alchemy of removing them from the White House is false,” prosecutors wrote.And while Trump’s attorneys have argued that as president, he could designate records as “personal” and lawfully keep them after leaving office, prosecutors said Thursday that, “Nothing in the PRA remotely suggests that the President can lawfully convert presidential records into personal ones simply by removing them from the White House at the end of his term.”The PRA says the moment a president leaves office, the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody and control of all presidential records from their administration. Personal records are described in the PRA as things like personal notes, materials relating to private political associations or materials relating exclusively to the president’s own election to the White House.This story has been updated with additional developments."

        "title": "Portland, hard drugs and other experiments in direct democracy",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Less than four years after Oregon voters decided to decriminalize small amounts of hard drugs in the state, legislators have had enough.A surge in fentanyl overdoses in the state drove state lawmakers to pass a bill aimed at rolling back the experiment, which was meant to signal an end to the decadeslong war on drugs.Oregon has suffered a spike in overdoses, but there is disagreement among researchers over whether the decriminalization effort or the rise of fentanyl is to blame. The decriminalization effort came quickly, and its goal of pouring money into treatment instead of prosecuting drug crimes barely had time to take hold.Certainly, the image of people openly using drugs in Oregon’s cities has been jarring, as CNN’s Josh Campbell and Michelle Krupa found. They traveled to Portland after the city’s Democratic mayor and the state’s Democratic governor declared a state of emergency over the fentanyl crisis.“Essentially what has happened is drugs in Oregon are the same as a traffic ticket,” Portland police Officer David Baer told them. And the fine can be waived if a user calls a hotline and agrees to a medical screening.Campbell and Krupa talked to people on every side of the complicated issue. Read their full report.If the newly passed bill is signed into law by Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek – she has not yet said what she will do – possession of small amounts of hard drugs would be punishable by up to six months in jail, although there would be alternatives to the penalty in the form of required treatment.Enacting the law to undo the voter initiative will, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting, apparently end efforts by at least one group to go further than the re-criminalization bill and could have put the issue back to voters this year.One way to view Oregon’s retreat from its idealistic effort to decriminalize drug use is that it’s in line with other liberal areas.Washington state, for example, struggled to pass new drug policy after a state court declared its felony drug possession law unconstitutional in 2021. San Francisco voters last year recalled the city’s liberal district attorney, Chesa Boudin, an advocate for criminal justice reform. The recall was a referendum on rising crime rates and open drug use in the city.Similarly, Democratic mayors in cities like New York and Chicago are now rethinking well-meaning sanctuary policies after thousands of asylum-seeking migrants were bused to them, without coordination, by Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in an ongoing bit of protest.But it is also worth looking at the Oregon drug use experiment from the perspective of direct democracy.Elected representatives, for a variety of reasons, frequently work to undermine ballot initiatives. Perhaps in Oregon, if voters were given the option of rolling back the decriminalization experiment they OK’d in 2020, they would have done so.That’s what Missouri voters did with regard to the drawing of congressional maps. In 2018, voters there passed a slate of good-government proposals to take some of the politics out of the redistricting process. Two years later, before those proposals fully took effect, Missouri voters undid them with a different initiative that reinserted politics in the process.In Florida, voters voted overwhelmingly in 2018 to re-enfranchise felons who served out their sentences. Florida’s Republican-controlled state government undermined that sentiment by placing conditions on restoring the right to vote.In Ohio, Republican lawmakers feared an initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution last November, so they called a special election for August on a separate amendment meant to make it more difficult to amend the state’s constitution. The idea was that a low-turnout, special election would help the anti-abortion rights effort. Voters said, “no thanks” and then went on to protect abortion rights in November.There are efforts underway in states across the country to make it more difficult to get initiatives placed on ballots, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. The center notes that some strategies include raising the number of signatures required to get an initiative in front of voters or requiring signatures to come from all over the state, although these frequently run into problems in court.About half the states allow for statewide initiatives, but restrictions put in place by legislators mean the process is really only usable in 17, according to Dane Waters, who has worked on direct democracy efforts both in the US and abroad and is founder of the Initiative & Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California.“People like representative government most of the time,” Waters told me. “Like 99.9% of the time.”But there are issues, frequently the ones where legislatures refuse to act or are slow, where voters get out of whack with their representatives.“Lawmakers try to avoid these issues that may be politically unpalatable for them,” he said.In red states, that might mean voters end up trying to raise the minimum wage or expand access to Medicaid through the initiative process. In blue states, it could be that voters take on tax issues.Waters worked on initiatives regarding term limits in the 1990s, and those efforts, which sought to limit how long legislators could serve, led lawmakers to try to limit the initiative process.Voters may ultimately want to change their minds. In California, Proposition 8 was a referendum that passed in 2008 that banned same-sex marriage with an amendment to the state constitution. That language was superseded when the US Supreme Court ultimately created a nationwide right to marriage. Still, California voters will get the opportunity to remove the language from their constitution with a referendum on Election Day in November."

        "text": "President Joe Biden will win Hawaii’s Democratic presidential contest Wednesday, CNN projects, continuing his march to the party’s 2024 nomination.Biden bested four other candidates — including Jason Palmer, the little-known entrepreneur who on Tuesday won the American Samoa caucuses; self-help guru Marianne Williamson; and Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, who dropped out of the race earlier Wednesday.Voters also had the option to choose “uncommitted,” a signal that they’re expressing displeasure with Biden without backing any alternative. That option received 29% of the vote – a higher percentage than what other protest votes have received in Democratic contests this cycle. But in raw numbers, it represented 455 votes out of 1,563 cast in the contest.A high-profile effort in Michigan to get voters to choose “uncommitted” in the Democratic primary, largely over the Biden administration’s response to the Israel-Hamas war, took 13% – or more than 100,000 raw votes. In the Minnesota Democratic primary on Super Tuesday, “uncommitted” got 19% – or more than 46,000 votes.There were 22 delegates to the Democratic National Convention at stake in Hawaii on Wednesday. According to CNN estimates, Biden will win 15 of them, with seven of the state’s delegates going to the Democratic National Convention uncommitted.Hawaii’s Democratic contest was a firehouse primary — one run by the state’s Democratic Party, rather than the Hawaiian government. There were two hours of voting available at locations around the state. Hawaii’s 2020 primary, which Biden won, was conducted entirely by mail, but party officials in January announced the switch to the cheaper option of holding a one-day contest without mail-in voting this year.Hawaii’s Republican caucuses are scheduled to take place on March 12."

Mike Collins of Georgia, requires the detention of any migrant who committed burglary or theft.Laken Hope Riley was found dead last month after jogging near a lake on the University of Georgia campus. Police say she was killed by a man who illegally crossed the border. The 22-year-old died from blunt force trauma to the head, according to Athens-Clarke County Coroner Sonny Wilson.One-hundred seventy Democrats voted against the bill. The ranking Democratic member on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, criticized the legislation on the floor, accusing Republicans of “exploiting her death for a partisan stunt” and “throwing together legislation to target immigrants in an election year.”House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who has repeatedly called on the Biden administration to take more executive actions on border issues, said in a statement, “Laken Riley would still be alive if the Biden Administration had done its job.”“House Republicans are not going to stand by quietly while the President and his administration release dangerous criminals into our communities,” Johnson said. “The Laken Riley Act would help prevent future tragedies. If Senator Schumer and President Biden care to protect Americans and are serious about securing the border, they will bring this legislation up for a vote and sign it into law immediately.”Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia passed out pins bearing Riley’s name to fellow GOP lawmakers on the House floor during the vote on the bill, and was seen pinning one on the lapel of GOP Rep. James Comer of Kentucky."

Ronny Jackson in 2022 after a scathing report from the Defense Department watchdog found the former White House physician drank on the job, routinely screamed at subordinates and acted inappropriately.Jackson, who retired in 2019 as a one-star rear admiral, was demoted to the rank of captain, according to two US officials.Jackson, who served as the top White House physician under President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump, still refers to himself as a retired rear admiral, the rank at which he retired on December 1, 2019. Now a Republican member of Congress, Jackson says on his website that he is a “retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral with nearly three decades of military service.”CNN has reached out to Jackson for comment.“The substantiated allegations in the DoDIG investigation of Rear Adm (lower half) Ronny Jackson are not in keeping with the standards the Navy requires of its leaders and, as such, the Secretary of the Navy took administrative action in July 2022,” said Commander Jacqueline Pau, a Navy spokeswoman.The Washington Post was first to report the news.When the Pentagon Inspector General report was first released March 2021, Jackson said it was a politically motivated attack that “resurrected” old allegations against him. He rejected any claims that he drank on the job.Jackson currently serves as a member of the House of Representatives from Texas, where he sits on the House Armed Services Committee. He has been an ardent Trump supporter.Then-President Trump nominated Jackson to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, after taking a personal liking to his doctor, who declared Trump in “excellent health” after his 2018 physical exam, despite evidence of heart disease and borderline obesity.It was after his nomination to lead the VA that allegations of misconduct first emerged, eventually leading to Jackson’s withdrawal from consideration.

        "text": "The Senate passed on Thursday an extension — and expansion — of funding for victims of radiation exposureThe vote was 69-30, and heads next to the House.Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri has been pushing to pass additional funding of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, since last year, and his guests for Thursday night’s State of the Union address include families from Missouri who have been affected by radiation contamination.Hawley told reporters last week that he wanted to see how several candidates for Senate GOP leader - including Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and John Thune of South Dakota - vote on this package, as he weighs who to support for the top job. Both Cornyn and Thune voted “no” Thursday.Democratic Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, both of New Mexico, who represent the site of the original atom bomb tests and construction, are also among those who have been advocating for this bill’s passage.It’s unclear when or if House Speaker Mike Johnson will bring the legislation up for a vote in the chamber.In a statement following the vote, Luján thanked Hawley for his efforts to pass the legislation.“Now, I urge Speaker Johnson to put this bipartisan bill on the House floor for a vote,” Lujan said. “Every day that Congress does not act is another day that the federal government has failed these victims.”After the vote, Hawley was immediately greeted by his wife, his young daughter, and several of the activists affected by radiation exposure.“We got Mitch McConnell,” said one woman as she hugged Hawley. “Sixty-nine?” another asked incredulously, on the verge of tears, referring to the number of senators who voted for the measure.Hawley, who has often criticized the Senate GOP leader, said that they “appreciate the support of Senator McConnell and everybody who voted for it, so that’s terrific. Now we got to get it passed in the House.”Asked about his strategy to get this bill passed on the House floor, Hawley said he needs to talk to Johnson about their plan.“We’re on the clock here, June 7, is when this ticks down,” he said, referencing the day that the funding expires. “So they need to pass it. There’s not a lot of time, but they now have a live vehicle with big support, including leadership support on both sides.”Pressed by CNN on the two declared candidates for Senate GOP leader voting against this bill, and if it could cost them his support, Hawley replied, “It means another candidate in the race, that’s what it tells me. We need some more options … I’m joking, but only half joking.”He continued, “I’ve been very clear this is really important. So I appreciated the leader’s support.”Hawley also noted that Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who is running for Senate Republican Conference chair, and Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, whom former President Donald Trump has encouraged to run for leader, both voted for the bill."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Two Filipino seafarers are among the dead after a Houthi ballistic missile struck a commercial ship in the Gulf of Aden, marking the first fatal attack by the Iran-backed militant group in its ongoing assaults in the Red Sea.At least three crew members were killed and four others injured in the attack Wednesday on the M/V True Confidence, a Barbados-flagged, Liberian-owned bulk carrier, US Central Command said in a statement. The ship has since been abandoned and coalition warships are now in the area assessing the situation, two US officials told CNN.In a statement Thursday, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) announced the death of its nationals and said two other Filipino crewmen were severely injured in the attack.The deadly strike marks a significant escalation of the Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping, which began in October in response to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.The Houthis said in a statement that the strike was “accurate” and caused a fire to break out on the ship.“The targeting operation came after the ship’s crew rejected warning messages from the Yemeni naval forces,” a Houthi statement said.The Houthis, having taken control of most of northern Yemen – including the capital Sanaa – present themselves as the legitimate rulers of the country.The Houthi statement reiterated the group’s support for the Palestinian people and said they will not stop their attacks in the Red Sea until Israeli “aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.”US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday that the deaths were “sadly inevitable.”“The Houthis have continued to launch these reckless attacks with no regard for the well-being of innocent civilians who are transiting through the Red Sea, and now they have unfortunately and tragically killed innocent civilians,” Miller said at a briefing.“The United States will continue to hold the Houthis accountable for their attacks, which have not just disrupted international commerce, not just disrupted the freedom of navigation and international waters, and not just endangered seafarers, but now tragically killed a number of them,” he said.The United Nations’ shipping agency chief expressed condolences over the deaths and made renewed calls to protect crew members following the tragedy.“Innocent seafarers should never become collateral victims,” International Maritime Organization Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez said in a statement.The Houthis have launched more than 45 missile and drone attacks against commercial and US and coalition naval vessels operating in the Red Sea, according to US and Western officials, most of which have been intercepted by US or coalition destroyers or landed harmlessly in the water.To date, no military vessels have been impacted by Houthi UAVs or missiles, according to US Defense Department spokesperson Maj. Pete Nguyen. But more than a dozen commercial ships, including several US vessels, have been hit since October, Nguyen said.The US and the United Kingdom have also carried out four rounds of strikes against Houthi targets inside Yemen since January, hitting weapons and missile storage facilities, one-way attack unmanned aerial and air defense systems, radars, and helicopters.US Central Command forces have also regularly conducted dynamic strikes against Houthi missiles seen preparing to launch from Yemen.The Biden administration has been struggling to stop the attacks, however, and the rebel group has continued to fortify its weapons stockpile in Yemen, CNN previously reported.Multiple officials told CNN the US still does not have “a denominator” that would allow them to assess the percentage of Houthi equipment the US and the UK have actually destroyed in airstrikes, and it is not clear whether the US will shift its military approach further.“We know that the Houthis maintain a large arsenal,” Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said last week, hours after the Houthis hit yet another cargo vessel in the Gulf of Aden with ballistic missiles. “They are very capable, they have sophisticated weapons, and that’s because they continue to get them from Iran.”“They continue to surprise us,” said one senior defense official, referring to the Houthis. “We just don’t have a good idea of what they still have.”And despite a robust US and coalition presence in the Red Sea, which includes the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier and several US destroyers, the Houthi attacks have caused a massive drop in ships traveling through the Suez Canal.The passage links the Red Sea with the Mediterranean Sea, allowing ships to cut thousands of miles off shipping routes instead of sailing around Africa. In the first half of February, the Suez Canal experienced a 42% drop in monthly transits and an 82% decrease in container tonnage from its peak in 2023, according to the UN."

        "text": "Ahead of President Joe Biden’s election-year State of the Union address to Congress, here’s a look at the data behind some of the topics and policies he could bring up Thursday evening.After inflation rose in 2021 and soared for most of 2022, it cooled to more reasonable levels by the end of 2023 and without triggering a recession.In January, the unemployment rate held steady at just 3.7%. And stock markets have been rallying since October. The S&P reached a new all-time high and notched its best showing in a year.Still, Americans are feeling the effects of rising home prices and mortgage rates, putting home ownership and the “American Dream” out of reach for many.The Biden administration has forgiven $138 billion in student loan debt for 3.9 million borrowers through a variety of programs.The president’s broad, one-time student debt cancellation plan, which would have erased $430 billion in total federal debt for borrowers, was struck down by the Supreme Court last year.Abortion is currently banned or restricted in 21 states, concentrated in the southeastern quadrant of the country. The Supreme Court’s June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which eliminated a constitutional right to abortion nationwide, has created a patchwork of state laws and an increasingly fragmented abortion landscape.The Supreme Court also reentered the abortion debate late last year and is slated to review a Texas lower court’s decision regarding access to medication abortion later this month. The high court could choose to protect full access to the abortion pill, or enforce restrictions such as revoking mail order access.With 656 mass shootings recorded, 2023 ranked second for the most mass shootings recorded in a single year in at least a decade. At least 71 mass shootings have been recorded in the United States this year, as of March 6.As the Russia-Ukraine war enters its third year, aid to Ukraine has been a major source of tension between the White House and House Republicans.In February, the Senate passed a $95 billion foreign aid package, including $60 billion for Ukraine, but Speaker Mike Johnson has yet to bring it to the House floor for a vote and it’s unclear if he will do so. The Senate’s package also included $14 billion for Israel as the latest Israel-Hamas conflict nears the six-month mark.The president is likely to tout what is largely seen as one of Democrats’ key legislative achievements so far, the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a major change to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs. While the rollout of this particular change is still in progress, here’s a look at the projected trend of out-of-pocket prescription drug spending for Americans:Data on US Customs and Border Protection encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border show a marked increase from pre-pandemic levels. While this is just one facet of immigration in the United States, the border crisis is a major issue that both Donald Trump and Biden are trading blame over as they head toward their likely general election rematch in November."

        "title": "Fact checking President Joe Biden’s State of the Union",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "President Joe Biden delivered his annual State of the Union address on Thursday. His statements were mostly accurate, a CNN fact check found, but he also made a smattering of claims that were false, misleading or lacking key context.Biden repeated his familiar misleading boast about how he had supposedly reduced the federal budget deficit, failing to explain that the decline overwhelmingly occurred because emergency pandemic spending from President Donald Trump’s tenure expired as schedule. He falsely claimed that “not anymore” would big companies be able to pay no federal income tax, overstating the impact of the 15% corporate minimum tax he signed into law.He misleadingly cited an alternative calculation from economists in his administration as if it was an actual federal tax rate paid by billionaires. And he left out context in discussing Covid-19 deaths, suggesting that far more deaths occurred during the Trump era than actually did.Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama made few specific assertions of fact during her official Republican response to Biden’s address. But Britt did falsely say, in present tense, that inflation is at a 40-year low; it no longer is.Here is a fact check of these claims and others.Biden criticized the fiscal management of former President Donald Trump during his State of the Union address, claiming, “They added more to the national debt than any presidential term in American history. Check the numbers.”Facts First: Biden’s numbers are correct; the national debt rose from about $19.9 trillion to about $27.8 trillion during Trump’s tenure, an increase of about 39% and more than in any other four-year presidential term, in part because of Trump’s major tax cuts. But it is an oversimplification to blame presidents alone for debt incurred during their tenures. Some of the Trump-era increase in the debt was due to the trillions of dollars in emergency Covid-19 pandemic relief spending that passed with bipartisan support and because of spending required by safety-net programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, that were created by previous presidents.The national debt has continued to increase under Biden. As of the day before Biden’s address, it was about $34.4 trillion, federal figures show – an increase of about 24% during his tenure.From CNN’s Katie Lobosco and Daniel DaleBiden claimed that the economy has added “800,000 new manufacturing jobs” during his administration.Facts first: Biden’s figure is correct. The US economy added 791,000 manufacturing jobs from Biden’s first full month in office, February 2021, through January 2024, the last month for which Bureau of Labor Statistics data is available – though it’s worth noting that the growth largely occurred in 2021 and 2022 (with 746,000 manufacturing jobs added starting in February 2021) before a relatively flat 2023.From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Alicia WallaceJust as he’s done on the campaign trail, Biden touted his administration’s efforts to reduce the burden of prescription drug costs. In his address, he also pointed out the savings for taxpayers.“That’s not just saving seniors money, it’s saving taxpayers money,” Biden said, referring to the Inflation Reduction Act, which contained several measures to reduce drug prices. “We cut the federal deficit by $160 billion.”Facts First: It’s true that two of the main drug price provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats pushed through Congress in 2022, are expected to reduce the deficit by $160 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In total, the law’s drug measures are expected to reduce the deficit by $237 billion, though delaying the implementation of a Trump administration drug rebate rule accounts for the difference.The Inflation Reduction Act authorized Medicare to negotiate the prices of certain costly prescription drugs for the first time. This measure is expected to save $98.5 billion over a decade, according to the CBO. Negotiations for the initial 10 drugs are underway. The final prices will be made public by September and take effect in 2026.The law also requires drugmakers to pay a rebate to the federal government if they raise the prices of certain medications faster than the rate of inflation. This is expected to save $63.2 billion over a decade, according to the CBO.From CNN’s Tami LuhbyBiden said: “I have been delivering real results in fiscally responsible ways.”“We’ve already cut the federal deficit – we’ve already cut the federal deficit of over $1 trillion,” he said.Facts First: Biden’s claim leaves out such critical context that it is misleading. While the annual federal budget deficit was more than $1 trillion lower in the 2023 fiscal year than it was in both the 2020 fiscal year (under President Donald Trump) and the 2021 fiscal year (partially under Trump and partially under Biden), analysts have repeatedly noted that Biden’s own actions, including laws he has signed and executive orders he has issued, have had the overall effect of worsening annual deficits, not reducing them. As in past remarks, Biden didn’t explain that the primary reason the deficit fell by a record amount during his tenure was that it had skyrocketed to a record high at the end of Trump’s term because of bipartisan emergency pandemic relief spending, then fell as expected when that spending expired as planned.“The deficit is a trillion dollars lower, roughly, than when President Biden took office. That’s true. But that’s driven not because he ‘reduced’ the deficit by a trillion dollars, but because when he took office it was the middle of Covid and we had been temporarily injecting huge sums of money into the economy,” Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group that promotes deficit reduction and tracks the issue, said in a February interview.The deficit hit a record of about $3.1 trillion under Trump amid the hefty pandemic-related spending in fiscal 2020. The deficit then fell under Trump and Biden in fiscal 2021 (to about $2.8 trillion) and again under Biden in fiscal 2022 (to about $1.4 trillion). But it then rose in fiscal 2023 (to about $1.7 trillion). And the jump from 2022 to 2023 would have been much bigger, from about $1 trillion in 2022 to about $2 trillion in 2023, if not for a Treasury Department accounting decision related to the Biden student debt cancellation program the Supreme Court blocked before it came into effect.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that the deficit will decline slightly in fiscal 2024, to about $1.5 trillion. Regardless, all of the Biden-era deficits are among the biggest in US history.Factors out of a president’s control, like interest rates hikes, have played a role in keeping deficits high under Biden. And Biden has signed some deficit-fighting bills; his signature Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is expected to bring down deficits by a total of more than $230 billion over a decade, while the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 is expected to cut a cumulative $1.5 trillion from federal deficits over a decade.Still, Biden’s actions have clearly added to deficits. These actions include a pandemic relief law, a bipartisan infrastructure law, a bipartisan law to spur semiconductor manufacturing, a boost to food stamp benefits and an extension of the Trump-era pandemic pause on federal student loan repayments.Biden can fairly say that his policies have contributed to a strong economic recovery that has boosted tax revenues and thus eaten into deficits. On the whole, though, Goldwein said deficits under Biden have been “higher than they otherwise would have been because of legislation President Biden has signed into law and executive actions he’s taken.”From CNN’s Daniel DaleBiden claimed the economy created a record 15 million jobs in the first three years of his term.Facts First: Biden’s claim is correct: the US economy added about 14.8 million jobs between Biden’s first full month in office, February 2021, and January 2024, more jobs than were added in any previous four-year presidential term. However, it’s important to note that Biden took office in an unusual pandemic context that makes meaningful comparison to other periods very difficult.Biden became president less than a year after the US economy had shed nearly 22 million jobs over two months, March 2020 and April 2020, because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The jobs recovery then began immediately after that, under then-President Donald Trump, but there was still an unprecedented hole to fill when Biden took office.Nonetheless, Biden is free to argue that his stimulus legislation and other policies have helped the country gain jobs faster than it otherwise would have. The US has had an extraordinarily strong labor market under Biden, and its overall economic recovery from the pandemic has outpaced those of many other major countries.From CNN’s Daniel DaleBiden cited a 2021 report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy think tank that found that 55 of the country’s largest corporations had made $40 billion in profit in their previous fiscal year but not paid any federal corporate income taxes. He said, “Remember in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion and paid zero in federal income taxes. Zero. Not anymore. Thanks to the law I wrote and we signed, big companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.”Facts First: Biden’s “not anymore” claim is false, an exaggeration. While his 15% corporate minimum tax will reduce the number of big companies that don’t pay any federal taxes, it’s not true that “not anymore” will any big company – such as the ones on the list of 55 companies Biden mentioned – ever do so. That’s because the minimum tax, on the “book income” companies report to investors, only applies to companies with at least $1 billion in average annual income. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, only 14 of the companies on its list of 55 non-payers reported having US pre-tax income of at least $1 billion.In other words, there will clearly still be some large and profitable corporations paying no federal income tax despite the existence of the tax. The exact number is not known.Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told CNN in 2022 that the new tax is “an important step forward from the status quo” and that it would raise substantial revenue, but he also said: “I wouldn’t want to assert that the minimum tax will end the phenomenon of zero-tax profitable corporations. A more accurate phrasing would be to say that the minimum tax will *help* ensure that *the most profitable* corporations pay at least some federal income tax.”There are lots of nuances to the tax; you can read more specifics here. Asked for comment in early 2023, when Biden made a similar claim, a White House official told CNN: “The Inflation Reduction Act ensures the wealthiest corporations pay a 15% minimum tax, precisely the corporations the President focused on during the campaign and in office.”From CNN’s Daniel DaleBiden claimed during his State of the Union address Thursday night that violent crime has fallen to one of its lowest levels in “more than 50 years.”Facts First: This is true, at least based on preliminary 2023 data that should be treated with caution. The preliminary 2023 data published by the FBI, running through the third quarter of the year, showed that violent crime was down 8.2% compared to the same period in 2022 – a decline that would be “historically large” for a year, crime data expert Jeff Asher wrote in a December article. Asher wrote: “The quarterly data shows violent crime down in big cities, small cities, suburban counties, and rural counties, pretty much across the board.”Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, told CNN in late February that, if the decline in reported violent crime for the full year of 2023 ended up being greater than 1.6%, 2023 would have the lowest violent crime rate since 1970. The 2022 rate was the second-lowest since 1970, worse than only 2019.As always, whether crime is rising or falling, it’s important to note that it is notoriously difficult to pinpoint the reasons that crime has increased or decreased at any given time, since there is a long list of economic, social and political factors at play; the impact of the president is unclear.From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth BlackburnBiden, as he was discussing the state of the country four years earlier, said more than 1 million American lives were lost to Covid-19, implying it was under the Trump administrationFacts First: Biden’s figure needs context. Many lives were lost to Covid-19 during the Trump administration, but the US didn’t reach its millionth death until May 2022 when Biden was in office.While there were a significant number of lives lost to Covid during the Trump administration, on President Donald Trump’s last full day in office the US death count reached at least 400,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. At that point during the pandemic there had been a winter surge in cases and someone was dying from the virus in the US every 26 seconds, according to KFF, a health policy and research organization. The death rate from Covid-19 in the US at the time was lower than in many other countries, but with the country’s large population, the death numbers exceeded all other countries at that time.Officially the US surpassed a million deaths from Covid in May 2022 during the Biden administration. As of this February, more than 1.18 million people in the US have died from Covid-19 according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.From CNN’s Jen ChristensenTouting the economy during his presidency, Biden said, “Unemployment at 50-year lows.”Facts First: This needs context.The unemployment rate did hit a five-decade low during two months of early 2023, 3.4%, and it has since remained close to that level – but the latest available unemployment rate, 3.7% for January, is higher than the rate was during nine months under President Donald Trump in 2019 and pre-pandemic 2020. (The rate then skyrocketed on account of the pandemic, and it was 6.4% the month Biden took office in January 2021.)From CNN’s Daniel DaleBiden said, “A record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses, and each one is a little act of hope.”Facts First: Biden’s claim is accurate based on federal data, though there is an important nuance to note. More than 16.3 million business applications had been filed during the Biden presidency as of February 17, official federal data show, the most over any period of the same length since the data series began in the mid-2000s. It’s worth noting that not all business applications turn into actual businesses. However, so-called “high propensity” business applications, those thought to have a high likelihood of turning into a business with employees, have also set records under Biden.The spike in overall business applications began in the second half of 2020 under President Donald Trump and accelerated under Biden in 2021; the number of applications then remained high in 2022 and then narrowly set a new record in 2023. There are various reasons for the pandemic-era boom in entrepreneurship, which began after millions of Americans lost their jobs in early 2020. Among them: some newly unemployed workers seized the moment of disruption to start their own enterprises; Americans had extra money from stimulus bills signed by Trump and Biden; interest rates were particularly low until the series of rate hikes that began in the spring of 2022.From CNN’s Daniel DaleBiden once again touted the impact that the temporary enhancement to the child tax credit – a key provision in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act – had on reducing the poverty rate among children. He called on Congress to bring back the now-expired beefed up credit.“In fact, the child tax credit I passed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions of working families and cut child poverty in half,” he said.Facts First: Biden’s assertions are true, though the benefit only lasted for the one year the temporary enhancement was in effect. Child poverty increased in 2022 to a rate higher than in 2020.The American Rescue Plan Act, which Democrats pushed through Congress in March 2021, increased the size of the credit for certain families, enabled many more parents to claim it and distributed half of it on a monthly basis.That sent child poverty – as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure – to a record low 5.2% in 2021, a drop of 46% from 2020, when the rate was 9.7% according to the US Census Bureau. The Supplemental Poverty Measure, which began in 2009, takes into account certain non-cash government assistance, tax credits and needed expenses.But in 2022, child poverty soared to 12.4%, roughly comparable to where it was prior to the pandemic in 2019. It was the largest jump in child poverty since the Supplemental Poverty Measure began.The House recently passed a tax bill that would again expand the child tax credit temporarily, though the boost would not be as generous as it was in 2021. However, the legislation is now stuck in the Senate, and it’s unclear whether it has the votes to pass.From CNN’s Tami LuhbyIn his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden said that the gap between the amount of goods the US imports from China and the amount it exports to China was the narrowest in more than 10 years.“Our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade,” Biden said. “We’re standing up against China’s unfair economic practices.”Facts First: What Biden said is true but needs context. The US trade deficit with China in 2023 was $279 billion, the US Commerce Department reported earlier this year. That was the lowest it has been since 2010.But the reason for the narrowing trade gap isn’t because of any Biden administration policy. Inflation has driven American consumers away from discretionary purchases, such as electronics – stuff that is primarily made in China. Instead, they’re buying more non-discretionary items, such as groceries.On top of that, the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese goods, which Biden’s administration left in place, have made Chinese goods less popular for Americans, because of the added cost.That’s why, for the first time in two decades, the US imported more goods from a country other than China: Mexico exported more goods to the US than any other country last year.The US trade gap didn’t just narrow with China: It shrank dramatically with most countries. The total US trade deficit was $773.4 billion last year, a nearly 19% decline from 2022. That’s the largest annual decline in the trade deficit since 2009. Also contributing to the narrowing trade gap: a weaker dollar that made US goods cost less overseas.From CNN’s Dave GoldmanPresidnet Joe Biden claimed during his State of the Union address that the average federal tax rate for billionaires is 8.2%.Facts First: Biden used the 8.2% figure in a way that was misleading. As in previous speeches, Biden didn’t explain that the figure is based on an alternative calculation from economists in his own administration that factors in unrealized capital gains that are not treated as taxable income under federal law. In other words, while Biden made it sound like he was talking about a federal tax rate, he was actually citing a figure that is not based on the way the US tax system actually works at present.There’s nothing inherently wrong with the alternative calculation itself; the administration economists who came up with it explained it in detail on the White House website in 2021. Biden, however, has tended to cite it without any context about what it is and isn’t, leaving open the impression that he was talking about what these billionaire families pay under current law.So what do the wealthiest billionaire families pay under current law? It’s not publicly known, but experts say it’s clearly more than 8%.“Biden’s numbers are way too low,” Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, told CNN in 2023. Gleckman said that in 2019, University of California, Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman “estimated the top 400 households paid an average effective tax rate of about 23 percent in 2018. They got a lot of attention at the time because that rate was lower than the average rate of 24 percent for the bottom half of the income distribution. But it still was way more than 2 or 3,” numbers Biden has used in some previous speeches, “or even 8 percent.”In February 2024, Gleckman provided additional calculations from the Tax Policy Center. The center found that the top 0.1% of households paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 30.3% in 2020, including an average income tax rate of 24.3%.From CNN’s Daniel DaleDelivering the official Republican response to Biden’s State of the Union address, Britt said, “We have the worst inflation in 40 years.”Facts First: This claim is false. Britt could have accurately said, in past tense, that inflation was at a 40-year high when it hit its Biden-era peak of 9.1% in June 2022. But inflation has declined sharply since that June 2022 peak, and the most recent available rate, for January 2024, was 3.1%. The Biden presidency aside, that rate was exceeded as recently as 2011 – far less than 40 years ago.Like Britt, former President Donald Trump and other Republicans have repeatedly ignored the decline in inflation since June 2022 to criticize Biden in the present tense.From CNN’s Daniel DaleBritt said that just after taking office in 2021, Biden “suspended all deportations.”“President Biden inherited the most secure border of all time. But minutes after taking office, he suspended all deportations.”Facts First: This needs context. Hours after taking office, Biden did call for a 100-day pause on deportations, but not “all deportations.”The moratorium excluded individuals suspected of terrorism or espionage, among other groups. But, more importantly, the suspension never actually took effect. A federal judge in Texas immediately blocked the action and it was never revived.From CNN’s Danya Gainor"

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The former chair of the Florida Republican Party will not be charged with video voyeurism, according to the state attorney’s office in Sarasota County, Florida.Christian Ziegler was ousted from his role atop the state party earlier this year amid an investigation into a woman’s rape allegations against him. While authorities declined to bring sexual battery charges against Ziegler, concluding a video of the sexual encounter showed it was “likely consensual,” they announced in January that they would seek to charge him with illegally recording the encounter.In a memo obtained by CNN, prosecutors said they were declining to pursue video voyeurism charges against Ziegler because they found inconsistencies in the woman’s statements.“The Victim’s expressed inability to recall whether she consented to recording the sexual activity along with her inconsistencies pertaining to key details of the event leave the State unable to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the video in question was filmed without her knowledge or consent. Accordingly, no charges will be filed,” the memo states.Ziegler’s attorney said his client is “relieved to finally be completely cleared of the false allegations and any criminal wrongdoing.”“We cooperated at every stage of investigation and as difficult as it was, we remained quiet out of respect for the investigation,” attorney Derek Byrd said. “On day one, we said that Mr. Ziegler was completely innocent. We asked everyone not to rush to judgement and reminded everyone to presume Mr. Ziegler innocent as the Constitution instructs. Unfortunately, many did not award that courtesy to Mr. Ziegler, damaging his family, career, and reputation throughout this process.”Ziegler came under investigation in October, after the woman accused him of raping her after she canceled a three-way sexual encounter with Ziegler and his wife, Bridget, a Sarasota County School Board member, and co-founder of the conservative parental rights group Moms for Liberty.In January, after reviewing the video Ziegler recorded on his cell phone of the sexual encounter, the Sarasota Police Department concluded it “likely consensual.” Police said that in an interview with the woman, she was shown the video and told investigators that she did not consent to the recording. In Florida, videotaping a sexual encounter without consent is a third-degree felony.“The video shows the phone was visible either in the Defendant’s hand or on the bed where the sexual encounter occurred,” prosecutors wrote in the memo, adding that the recording “did not appear to be taken from any hidden device or secretive angle that would tend to show that a phone recording a video was being hidden from the Victim.”Prosecutors said that inconsistencies in the woman’s story “appear to be the result of substantial intoxication and trauma,” noting that she never tried to significantly change her account or push authorities to file charges.News of the investigation, first reported by the Florida Center for Government Accountability, sparked an immediate backlash. There were calls for the Zieglers to resign from their high-profile positions. Christian Ziegler refused and was voted out of his leadership role in January. Bridget Ziegler, who was never accused of criminal wrongdoing, continues to face calls to step down from the Sarasota County School Board."

        "title": "Joe Biden promised to ‘absorb’ 2 million asylum seekers ‘in a heartbeat’ in 2019 - he now faces an immigration crisis",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "During his 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden promised a stark departure from the immigration policies of the Trump administration.He pledged a 100-day moratorium on deportations after taking office. He promised to protect sanctuary cities from federal law enforcement agencies. And he harshly criticized the Trump administration’s treatment of undocumented immigrants at the southern border, asserting that America had the capacity to “absorb people” while calling on asylum seekers to “surge” to the border“We could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million,” Biden said at one event in August 2019. “The idea that a country of 330 million people cannot absorb people who are in desperate need and who are justifiably fleeing oppression is absolutely bizarre.”An estimated 3 million migrants who have been encountered at the southern border since Biden took office in January 2021 remain in the US, according to figures flagged by the Biden administration.But the mass influx of asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border has significantly strained US immigration resources. And turned into a significant political problem for President Biden—one that former President Donald Trump is seeking to capitalize on. In a recent CNN poll, Biden’s handling of immigration garnered his lowest approval rating, with only 30% of Americans expressing approval of how he was dealing with the border.That’s led Biden to dramatically change the way he talks about the situation at the border, shifting away from the more liberal immigration positions he espoused as a presidential contender and returning to more centrist views he held as a senator and vice president.Most recently, the White House shifted its rhetoric on sanctuary cities, urging the cities to comply with law enforcement agencies regarding migrants who’ve committed a crime. And Biden has embraced a now-stalled border bill that would have significantly tightened asylum laws and included a host of other conservative agenda items.“For too long, we all know the border’s been broken,” Biden said in January in support of the bill. “It’s long past time to fix it.”In many respects, Biden’s shift aligns closely with a more longstanding position on immigration throughout his political tenure. Over decades as a US senator and in his prior presidential bids, Biden maintained more centrist positions. It was primarily in reaction to the policies of the Trump administration that Biden began adopting notably progressive stances on immigration during the 2020 presidential campaign.In a statement to CNN, a White House spokesperson reiterated the administration’s call for congressional Republicans to support the bipartisan border bill.“Absent Congressional action and as we experience historic global migration, this Administration has led the largest expansion of lawful pathways in decades, worked with partners across the region to address irregular migration, and enforced our laws.”In a sign of how important immigration is as an issue in the 2024 election, both Biden and Trump held campaign appearances at the southern border last week, with Trump traveling to Eagle Pass and Biden about 300 miles away in Brownsville, Texas.Biden directly called on Trump to support the border bill and encourage Republicans to take it up on the floors of Congress.“So, here’s what I would say to Mr. Trump: Instead of playing politics with the issue, instead of telling members of Congress to block this legislation, join me. Or I’ll join you – in telling the congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill. We can do it together. You know and I know it’s the toughest, most efficient, most effective border security bill this country’s ever seen,” said Biden. “So instead of playing politics with the issue, why don’t we just get together and get it done.”President Biden is also widely expected to touch on immigration and the crisis at the border during his State of the Union address to Congress this evening.Biden’s rhetorical shift on immigration reflects a broader pivot among Democrats. Last week, Rep. Tom Suozzi was sworn in after winning a special election to replace ousted Republican Rep. George Santos in New York.Suozzi won in part by running on a platform that included cracking down at the border despite having boasted in 2022 about “kicking ICE out of Nassau County” as a county executive. But in his special election in 2024, he ran ads touting his support for Border Patrol and securing the border.At a Democratic debate in September 2019, Biden said as president he would do “several more things.”“I would in fact make sure that there is – we immediately surge to the border all those people are seeking asylum. They deserve to be heard. That’s who we are,” Biden said.“We’re a nation that says, ‘If you wanna flee and you’re fleeing oppression, you should come,’” he added.During his 2020 presidential campaign against Donald Trump, Biden was in a much different position as illegal border crossings were significantly lower than they are today.Much of Biden’s rhetoric at the time came in response to then-President Trump’s harsh rhetoric and policies related to the border. A year before he launched his campaign, in 2018, the Trump administration unveiled a “zero tolerance” policy on illegal immigration.Under Trump, the Justice Department announced it would pursue criminal charges against every adult crossing the border unlawfully. This led to the separation of numerous families, including those with infants as young as a few months old, as children couldn’t be detained alongside their parents in federal prisons.The policies faced widespread outcry and backlash and played significantly in that year’s Democratic primary. And Biden was contending with his own record on immigration – both as vice president and a senator – where he once supported significantly harsher policies and the country saw record deportations. Those policies drew flack from those running to his left in the party’s primary.“No great country can say it’s secure without being able to secure its borders,” Biden said during a campaign stop while running for president in 2007.In the run-up to and during that campaign in 2008, Biden spoke about jailing employers who hire “illegals,” said sanctuary cities shouldn’t be allowed to violate federal law and argued a fence was needed to stop “tons” of drugs coming into the country from “corrupt Mexico.”While Biden didn’t go as far as some of his opponents in that Democratic primary, in speeches and debates he vowed to reverse Trump’s asylum policies.“‘The fact is that, look, we should not be locking people up,” Biden said at a June 2019 Democratic primary debate. “We should be making sure we change the circumstance - as we did - why they would leave in the first place. And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe until they can be heard.”“Our Statue of Liberty, not very far from here says, invites us to welcome the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to be free,” he said in a speech in July 2019. “I’ll reverse Trump’s detrimental asylum policies.”Upon taking office, Biden issued executive orders ending construction on the border wall; reversed the so-called Muslim ban, which prohibited travel from several majority-Muslim countries; directed law enforcement agencies to narrow the pool of undocumented immigrants vulnerable to arrest, detention and removal; and raised the refugee resettlement ceiling to 125,000 people.The Biden administration also reversed the so-called “Remain in Mexico” program, which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases were reviewed by US immigration courts, and ended the Trump-instituted Title 42, the public health order that allowed for the quick expulsion of migrants without hearing their asylum claims, in the spring of 2023.After Title 42 ended, the government returned to its decades-old section of the US code, known as Title 8. The Biden administration then implemented new, stricter rules that bar asylum claims for migrants who passed through another country on their way to seeking asylum in the US; those who book their appointment online are exempt."

        "title": "Why Costco is selling gold bars and silver coins",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Costco locked in $1.50 hot dog-soda loyalists. Now, it’s chasing a different clientele: precious metal investors and collectors.Costco recently started selling silver coins for the first time, finance chief Richard Galanti told CNN.The company is selling 25-count tubes of 1 oz. Canada Maple Leaf Silver Coins online for $675. The front of the coins features a maple leaf, and King Charles III is on the back. The coins are non-refundable, and members can purchase a maximum of five.Costco is trying to replicate its recent success with gold bars. It began selling $2,000 gold bars online in September and sold more than $100 million worth of the bars last quarter.But Costco’s move is more about marketing than just about increasing sales. After all, not many people are actually stashing away gold bars in their homes.It’s selling precious metals to try to reinforce its “treasure hunt” brand image where it peppers its stores with unexpected, limited-time items to keep shoppers coming back.“We try to create an attitude that, if you see it, you ought to buy it because chances are it ain’t going to be there next time,” Costco’s founder once said. “That’s the treasure-hunt aspect. We constantly buy that stuff and intentionally run out of it from time to time.”Costco is also selling precious metals as they become more valuable. Gold prices have notched record highs this week. Silver futures are up 21% in the past year.Precious metal prices have gone up because investors are betting that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the back half of the year.Gold and silver are considered to be one of the most resilient investments. When interest rates fall, holding income-paying assets (like bonds) becomes less appealing than owning the precious metals. When interest rates are low, falling or — as in this case — expected to fall, demand for Treasury bonds ebbs, and precious metals, which don’t pay out any interest, become relatively more attractive.Some investors also believe them to be a hedge against inflation, wagering that they will hold their value even if it begins to surge, even though metals face price fluctuations like any other commodity.Costco’s success in selling the metals comes as the company continues to report strong profits from the pandemic in 2020, when customers rushed to stores to load up on groceries and household staples. Millions of first-time customers signed up for club memberships during the pandemic and have held on to them, pushing Costco’s member rolls to all-time highs.Shares of Costco (COST) have rallied 60% over the past year.Costco reported quarterly earnings Thursday. The company’s sales at stores open for at least one year increased 5.6%, but fell short of analyst forecasts.Costco said inflation was roughly flat during the quarter, which allowed it to reduce prices on some items.Galanti told analysts on a call Thursday that Costco cut reading glasses, for example, from $18.99 to $16.99 and cut a 48-count of batteries from $17.99 to $15.99."

        "title": "Minnesota unions plan to wage simultaneous strikes",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Nearly 10,000 workers from a coalition of separate unions, working for a diverse group of employers, are planning a series of coordinated strikes in Minnesota this week and next. Their aim: Exert leverage at the bargaining table.First to the picket lines Monday are about 4,000 janitors who work cleaning corporate offices who began a strike scheduled to last three days. They were joined Tuesday by 1,000 workers at a dozen nursing homes who are planning a one-day strike. And about 4,000 teachers in St. Paul are due to go on strike next week.Union leaders say the strategy is already paying dividends, as a number of unions set to wage strikes of their own this week recently reached deals that provided double-digit percentage pay increases and retirement and health benefits their members never had before.One of those deal was announced Monday evening, when Laborers’ International Union of North America announced it had reached a deal with the City of Minneapolis on a new contract for about 500 municipal workers. The union said the deal included raises totaling 30% over three years, which it said was the largest pay raise the union had ever won. And it said it will continue to support the unions that have not yet won a deal.“This victory shows that when we are united in solidarity with our union brothers and sisters, we have the power to win,” said AJ Lange, business agent at the local union representing the workers. “When we stand together, we can’t be ignored.”Other recent deals include one that covers about 2,500 bus drivers, another that covers about 2,000 security guards, as well as contracts for about 500 workers who clean big box stores at night as well as about 100 employees of Minneapolis’ downtown improvement district.“The only way we’re going to be seen and heard is if we show we’re ready to take action together,” said Greg Nammacher, president SEIU Local 26, one of the locals leading the effort.These kind of collective strikes are common and somewhat easier in Europe, where union membership is more widespread and unions can strike in support of other unions, even if their own contracts have expired. Under US labor law each union needs to be striking to reach its own demands, and can not walk out in a sympathy for other unions’ labor disputes, even if their contract may allow them to honor another union’s picket lines. But those kinds of sympathy strikes are allowed in most of Europe, and thus make general strikes across broad swaths of those economies far more frequent.But most of these contracts expired weeks or months ago, and the unions’ planned to stay on the jobs under terms of the expired contact until a critical mass of union members were able to strike.“It wasn’t very effective for us to each be doing this on our own,” said Nammacher. “The breakthroughs we have in the contracts that have already settled is due to the public attention that is not possible without the coordinated effort.”One of those on the picket lines Monday was George Mullins, 66, who has worked as a janitor cleaning office buildings for 35 years. He works at the corporate offices of Target, employed by a private cleaning contractor. He said his pay of $18.62 an hour is barely enough to get by on.“There’s a lot of things you used to be able to do that you can’t do with the inflation that’s set in,” he said in an interview with CNN. “I want to retire, but the reason I’m still working now is there’s no pension.” He was able to raise a family with his pay in the past, but he said if his children weren’t grown and on their own, he couldn’t support a family with his pay today.“Some of the younger workers are quitting. Some are picking up other jobs, which means less time with your family,” he said.He’s gone on strike twice before, but those were both one-day strikes that he and the union knew would be over quickly. He doesn’t mind staying out longer this time.“I’m willing to stay out as long as it takes,” he said. “The wage is not keeping up with the cost of living.”A spokesperson for Mullins’ employer did not return a request for comment Monday.Strikes have become far more common across the US economy in the course of the last year. There were 33 strikes by 1,000 or more workers last year, a 43% increase from 2022, according to the official Labor Department count, the biggest number of large work stoppages in America in more than 20 years.Roughly 462,000 workers were on strike at some point in 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics report, which means 16.7 million days of work lost when researchers account for the number of strikers and the length of the strikes. That’s up from only 127,000 strikers who were off the job for a total of 2.2 million days in 2022.A separate database kept by by Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations that tracks strikes both large and small shows 451 work stoppages in 2023, up 9% from the 2022 total.The fact that multiple unions plan to strike together in Minnesota is giving members more confidence, according to Jamie Gully, president of SEIU Healthcare Minnesota and Iowa. Few of his 1,000 members who are due to go on a one-day strike Tuesday have ever been on strike before, even for one day.“For the workers, seeing that they’re part of something bigger has been really motivating and less scary,” Gully said. He said he hopes that if these negotiations prove successful, unions elsewhere in the country will use the same strategy.The United Auto Workers union arranged for the contracts they reached with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis last fall – contracts that ended six-week strikes at those companies – to expire on April 30, 2028, in hope that other unions would also have contracts expire at the same time, allowing a May 1 strike across the economy.May 1, or May Day, is an international labor holiday."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Europeans using Apple, Google and other major tech platforms woke to a new reality Thursday as a landmark law imposed tough new competition rules on the companies — changing European Union citizens’ experience with phones, apps, browsers and more.The new EU regulations force sweeping changes on some of the world’s most widely used tech products, including Apple’s app store, Google search and messaging platforms, including Meta’s WhatsApp. And they mark a turning point in a global effort by regulators to bring tech giants to heel after years of allegations that the companies harmed competition and left consumers worse off.The broad obligations apply only to the EU, which could leave tech users in the United States and other markets looking longingly at some of the features Big Tech is rolling out in response to the European directive.In one seismic shift to comply with the law, Apple said it plans to let EU users download iPhone apps via third-party app stores — easing its grip on iOS for the first time since the App Store’s debut 15 years ago.In another significant change, Google said it will alter search results to drive more traffic to independent comparison-shopping or travel-booking sites, instead of directing users toward Google Flights or other tools it owns. Google will also allow Android users to select a preferred browser and search engine from a menu of options when first setting up their devices, rather than defaulting users to Google’s Chrome browser and search engine. That could give a leg up to rival browsers such as Opera or Mozilla’s Firefox and competing search engines including DuckDuckGo or Microsoft’s Bing.Users of messaging apps such as Signal or Viber, meanwhile, could soon be able to send chat messages directly to people who use Meta’s Messenger and WhatsApp platforms, under a new openness requirement imposed on the social media giant.And streaming services such as Spotify and Netflix could potentially market discounts within their apps to those that buy subscriptions through the services’ respective websites rather than through proprietary in-app payment systems once forced on app developers by the app stores.The industry-wide changes are linked to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a 2022 law requiring dominant online platforms to give users more choices and rivals more opportunities to compete. Its broad obligations affect six of the world’s largest tech companies: Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.By mid-May, that list could also include Elon Musk’s X and Booking.com, the European Commission said this week.Violations of the DMA can lead to stiff penalties, including fines of up to 10% of a company’s global revenue and up to 20% for repeat offenses. For most of the regulated companies, that would translate to tens of billions of dollars.For years, policymakers around the world have accused tech giants of monopolizing digital markets and using consumers’ personal data to entrench their power or to identify new markets to dominate. The tech giants, for their part, have insisted they compete vigorously, have created valuable opportunities for entrepreneurs and unlocked billions of dollars in economic activity.Europe’s broad new rules highlight skepticism of that defense and showcase how the EU has led the charge on tech regulation globally, sometimes with ripple effects for the rest of the world.The trading bloc has approved other comprehensive legislation in recent years regulating digital privacy, social media and, soon, artificial intelligence. Some of its regulations have had broader impacts: In 2022, a new EU law forcing Apple to use USB-C as the charging standard for mobile devices prompted Apple to adopt the standard for all its new iPhones, including in the United States.Europe’s new competition law does not directly target the six named companies. Rather, it says that companies meeting a specific size threshold must abide by certain “gatekeeper” rules to prevent them from abusing their enormous economic power.One way the EU plans to regulate that power is by giving consumers more control over how tech giants use their personal information. Under the DMA, EU citizens will be able to opt out of having their usage history from one app shared with other apps owned by the same company. For example, Google users will be able to prevent their search and browsing histories from being shared with Google’s YouTube video platform, which could affect what videos YouTube suggests to users. Amazon, meanwhile, will need consumers’ consent before using their Prime Video, Kindle or Audible usage history to create targeted recommendations or advertisements on its e-commerce marketplace.Europe’s first-of-its-kind digital competition law draws contrasts to the United States, where proposals to regulate the tech industry have repeatedly floundered. Some of the ideas in the DMA have been replicated in US legislation but have failed to pass amid industry opposition and ordinary congressional gridlock.While the law could increase demand for tech companies to extend EU-specific features to other markets, few platforms have shown signs they plan to do so. For example, Apple’s app store plans for Europe diverge significantly from changes to its US-based app store that it was forced to make as part of an antitrust lawsuit involving “Fortnite”-maker Epic Games. Apple has not given any indication it will harmonize the two sets of policies.Consumer groups say the DMA promises to lower prices for Europeans by forcing platforms open and requiring them to compete on a more level playing field.“We have worked really hard at the EU level to get this law adopted to improve digital markets in benefit of consumers,” said Agustin Reyna, legal director at BEUC, a coalition of EU-based consumer advocacy organizations.But some tech companies have pushed back on the DMA, warning that it could lead to unintended consequences.Google, for example, argued this week that its changes to search results in response to the DMA could drive more searches to aggregators of travel or restaurant listings rather than to individual hotels, airlines, restaurants and retailers. It also warned that because of the new requirements around data-sharing, many of Google’s recommendation features “won’t work in the same way anymore,” suggesting life could become less convenient for users who revoke their consent.Meanwhile, Apple has said that requirements to support third-party app stores could expose iOS users to greater amounts of spammy or malicious software, due to Apple’s weakened control over app developers.“The new options we’re introducing to comply with the DMA necessarily mean we will not be able to protect users in the same way,” Apple wrote in a white paper it published last week ahead of Thursday’s compliance deadline. “The changes the DMA requires will inevitably cause a gap” between EU users’ security and the security Apple users enjoy outside the EU, it added.That may have a kernel of truth, but proponents of the DMA have said it can be difficult to determine where legitimate objections to the law end and where self-interest begins.As companies begin to comply with the letter of the DMA, expect some to try to evade its spirit by using consumer scare tactics or “dark patterns,” subtle interface designs intended to nudge users toward sharing more of their data or making other choices a company prefers, Reyna said.“These include misleading language such as ‘use for free’ when consumers pay [for a service] with their data,” BEUC wrote in a report last week. “Data protection options are buried in a maze of settings, and the use of contrast and colours for the ‘accept’ and ‘refuse’ buttons can steer users to the response the gatekeeper wants.”Some companies are already accusing tech giants of flouting the law.On Wednesday, Epic Games published emails showing Apple blocked its request this month to launch a third-party app store on iOS in Europe. In a complaint to EU officials, Epic said Apple justified the decision by referencing Epic’s past deliberate violation of Apple’s app store terms and Epic’s public criticism of Apple.If Apple’s decision is allowed to stand, it will mean tech giants can thwart competition and undermine the law just by pointing to a rival’s past efforts to call out anticompetitive behavior, said Tim Sweeney, Epic Games’ CEO.Past US court rulings have upheld Apple’s right to cut ties with Epic for any reason, Apple said in a statement. “In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right.”The European Commission has asked Apple to explain its actions under the DMA, a Commission spokesperson told CNN Thursday. The EU’s executive body is also evaluating whether Apple’s actions “raise doubts on their compliance” with other EU rules, the spokesperson added.Thursday’s deadline is the final opportunity for gatekeeper companies to submit detailed plans to the European Commission showing how they will comply with the DMA.After reviewing the plans, which could take weeks or months, the commission may choose to launch investigations into companies suspected of noncompliance. Those probes could last for up to one year. Even after the plans are reviewed, the commission could still launch compliance investigations at any time, particularly if it receives complaints from the public.The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a trade group representing four of the six gatekeeper companies — Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta — told CNN that “regulators need to resist the urge to politicize the process” of reviewing the plans.DMA enforcement “should be proportionate and unbiased, taking into account the significant differences between gatekeepers, as well as how these services work in reality,” said Daniel Friedlaender, senior vice president of CCIA and head of its Europe office.Friedlaender warned that the DMA could also frustrate consumers by leading to “product updates they don’t want” or that they could see “changes to their favorite services they really don’t like.”Olesya Dmitracova contributed reporting."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Self-checkout annoys many grocery shoppers and causes problems that are prompting numerous major retailers to pull back on using it. But that’s not stopping the Transportation Security Administration from testing a self-service screening system at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas later this month.TSA PreCheck passengers at LAS “will be the first travelers to have the option to use the new system starting in mid-March, when the testing begins,” said a TSA news release.“The prototype has a video monitor that provides step-by-step instructions for passengers to complete screening at their own pace,” it added.After passengers complete “the required screening process and are cleared for travel, automated exit doors open so travelers can gather their belongings and head to their flights.”“While there is minimal assistance from Transportation Security Officers (TSO), TSOs will be available for assistance as needed,” according to the release. “TSA and S&T will carefully study the results of this assessment before they announce a timeline for any future deployment of this prototype to other checkpoint lanes or at other airports.”TSOs will still perform scanning of bags and other personal items sent through the self-service areas, said R. Carter Langston, the TSA press secretary.“Several TSOs are present in the self-service screening lanes,” he told CNN in an email. “To be clear, this is not about replacing TSOs or reducing the number of TSOs,” which is currently 50,000.After a sharp drop in flying and screening during the early years of the pandemic, the agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, is dealing with an increase in the number of passenger screenings.TSA has screened 143 million people at its checkpoints so far this year, which is typically a slow period for US air travel. That’s up 8 million, or 6% from the same period last year. During the six-week holiday travel period from the weekend before Thanksgiving through the end of 2023, it screened 106 million, up 10% from a year earlier, and up 2% from the same time in 2019, ahead of the pandemic.A record number of weapons were seized at TSA checkpoints in 2023: a total of 6,737 firearms, 93% of which were loaded.Travelers have flocked to Las Vegas in record numbers in the last year.According to TSA, the busiest day ever for TSA screening operations at the city’s airport was on October 29, 2023, when the agency screened 103,400 passengers. The second busiest day for TSA operations at LAS was Sunday, November 5, 2023, when 103,285 were screened.“The number of airline passengers continues to increase year-over-year, creating a need for innovative screening solutions that enhance transportation security and make traveling more efficient,” said Dimitri Kusnezov, Department of Homeland Security under secretary for science and technology.– CNN’s Chris Isidore contributed to this story"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Boeing has not turned over important records to investigators probing the door plug blowout on a 737 Max earlier this year, investigators say. That, Boeing signaled Wednesday afternoon, is because there are no records.The records in question are documentation of steps on the assembly line last fall when National Transportation Safety Board investigators believe Boeing employees removed critical bolts that hold the plug in place, but did not reinstall the bolts before the plane left the Boeing factory in October 2023. The plane flew about 150 commercial flights before the door plug flew off the plane mid-flight on January 5, just over two months ago.“Boeing has not provided us with the documents and information that we have requested numerous times over the past few months, specifically with respect to opening, closing and removal of the door and the team that does that work at the Renton facility,” National Transportation Safety Board chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said Wednesday in testimony before the US Senate Commerce Committee.She testified that because of Boeing’s actions, NTSB investigators do not know who on the Boeing assembly line removed and reinstalled the door plug that — months later while the plane was in service carrying passengers — blew out.After her testimony, Boeing followed up with a statement: “With respect to documentation, if the door plug removal was undocumented there would be no documentation to share. We will continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the NTSB’s investigation.”The Federal Aviation Administration has recently identified issues with processes on Boeing’s manufacturing line. Earlier this week, it said a six-week audit of the company identified “non-compliance issues in Boeing’s manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control,” although it did not specify the specific shortcomings.NTSB investigators have made multiple visits to Boeing facilities and created a special team to handle requesting and processing documents from Boeing and its key contractor, Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing said it has “worked proactively and transparently to fully support the NTSB’s investigation.”“Our team works tirelessly with the NTSB team to respond comprehensively to all NTSB information requests and bring information to them that would be relevant to their investigation,” Boeing said.In particular, Homendy said, investigators are keen on identifying the actual Boeing employees who had their hands on the door plug bolts.“There is one team – one team – that deals with the doors,” Homendy said. The team includes 25 employees and a manager, and she called it “absurd” and “really disappointing” that NTSB still did not have names.Following her testimony, Boeing signaled that it was providing the requested list of names.“Early in the investigation, we provided the NTSB with names of Boeing employees, including door specialists, who we believed would have relevant information,” Boeing said. “We have now provided the full list of individuals on the 737 door team, in response to a recent request.”A source familiar with the request said the specific ask for those names was submitted to Boeing over the last weekend.Homendy also raised concerns with Spirit’s approach to the probe, saying three individuals Spirit presented to the NTSB for interviews actually did not work for the company, and instead worked for a subcontractor. Spirit has not commented on Homendy’s comments.Homendy said the FAA has been “very cooperative” with the NTSB probe."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "We’ve all seen the combination Taco Bell and KFC, or the joint Auntie Anne’s and Cinnabon. Now another dual-branded restaurant could enter the US dining landscape.Dine Brands Global is considering an Applebee’s and IHOP combination, according to an earnings call on February 28. Dine Brands is the parent company of both restaurant chains.Applebee’s is shrinking. While Dine Brands added a net 33 IHOP restaurants domestically in 2023, the company closed 46 Applebee’s locations and only opened 10 new ones, according to the company’s 10-K.Dine Brands wants Applebee’s to return to growth, the company said during its earnings call. Because of the cost to build an Applebee’s, Dine Brands is “assembling a prototype” for another option.The revenue for the joint restaurants could double that of the standalone restaurants, the company said in the earnings call. That’s because the two restaurants’ menus hit all parts of the day (such as pancakes for breakfast and boneless wings at night).Other companies are leaning into the idea of joint restaurants. Many combination fast food restaurants that customers see are owned by Focus Brands, which has Auntie Anne’s, Carvel, Cinnabon, Jamba, Moe’s Southwest Grill, McAlister’s Deli and Schlotzsky’s under its umbrella.In January 2023, Focus Brands said these combination locations are the future of fast-food joints, and said it had 175 of these restaurants under its portfolio, with 65 more on the way.Focus Brands also saw the revenue potential. Combination locations allowed these restaurants, such as Auntie Anne’s and Cinnabon, to expand past malls and into busier streetside spots.“There will always be a place in malls, but there is an immense amount of growth opportunity in streetside venues, and, by dual branding, there is more opportunity for enhanced revenue,” said Brian Krause, Focus Brands chief development officer, in a 2023 statement.The IHOP-Applebee’s combination already exists for those who are dreaming of a pancake stack with a Dollarita on the side. International locations of the combo exist, and Dine Brands CEO John Peyton said the company just opened its eighth IHOP-Applebee’s in Leon, Mexico.At international locations already established, the two brands share a back of house and have a blended front of house for diners.With the international prototypes, Peyton said the company is “gaining experience and knowledge as we contemplate introducing this concept in the US.”Mexico is one of the brand’s largest international markets, Peyton said in the earnings call.“We will continue to monitor the success of this test concept and will consider options for further expansion in the US in select locations if and when it makes sense to do so,” said Peyton in an emailed statement."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Target, a barometer of the American consumer, said its sales last year fell for the first time since 2016. Now it’s predicting a sluggish 2024 as shoppers are weighed down by higher prices.Target said Tuesday that its sales at stores open for at least one year declined 3.7% last year. Target projects sales to grow by up to 2% this year.The company’s business has slowed since shoppers stocked up at its stores and online during the height of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.Since its surge, Target’s core middle-class customer base has been strained by higher prices and pulled back on discretionary goods, such as home decor, electronics and non-essential clothing. Target’s sales have declined for three straight quarters.Nevertheless, the company exceeded Wall Street’s sales expectations for the holiday season, and Target’s (TGT) stock surged more than 8% higher Tuesday in premarket trading. Heading into Tuesday, Target’s stock had dropped 43% since its 2021 peak.Target has slumped because of its merchandise mix and prices compared to rivals like Walmart.The company stocks more non-essential merchandise compared to competitors such as Walmart (WMT) and Costco (COST). More than half of Target’s merchandise is discretionary — clothing, home decor, electronics, toys, party supplies and other non-essentials. Target in recent years has added more food and essentials to its stores, but still trails Walmart, which gets around half of sales from groceries.Target’s prices are also higher than Walmart’s. In February, Target’s prices were on average 8.6% higher than Walmart, according to an analysis by RBC Capital Markets analysts.Store theft and safety have also become bigger concerns at Target.Target said in October that it’s closing nine stores in major cities specifically because “theft and organized retail crime are threatening the safety of our team and guests, and contributing to unsustainable business performance.”But Target’s closures in New York, San Francisco, Oakland, Seattle and Portland may also be due more to the underperformance of Target’s smaller store locations, analysts say.Target said its shrink costs — losses due to theft, incorrectly-scanned items and other merchandise errors — fell last quarter.Fierce right-wing backlash to Target’s Pride Month collection also took a toll on the brand last year."

        "title": "Americans’ credit scores are falling. That hasn’t happened in a decade",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Even as unemployment remains historically low and recession fears fade, consumer credit scores are starting to buckle.The national average FICO score dipped to 717 as of October, down from 718 in July, according to data released Wednesday by FICO, an analytics company that evaluates the strength of borrowers.Although FICO scores remain near record highs — and well above pre-pandemic levels — this marks the first drop in a decade.It’s another sign that at least some Americans are feeling financial stress. The cost of living remains high and the Federal Reserve’s inflation-fighting medicine — high interest rates — is adding to the pressure.“The effects of high interest rates and persistent inflation may be starting to weigh on consumers, especially those already struggling to manage their finances,” Can Arkali, FICO’s senior director of scores and predictive analytics, wrote in the report.FICO said the one-point drop in credit scores in late 2023 was driven by an increase in Americans missing payments and also by rising debt levels.The last time credit scores fell was between April and October 2013, when the average FICO score dropped by two points, to 690.Credit scores have steadily increased since then — even during the turmoil of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although job loss spiked during Covid, stimulus checks and forbearance from banks and credit card companies helped many consumers avoid financial trouble.Arkali told CNN that this is an indicator that should be watched closely over the coming quarters. However, he said this one-point drop in credit scores is not necessarily a red flag.“While this is a notable milestone, it’s not a drastic decrease and not one that should sound an alarm,” he said.US credit card debt climbed to a fresh record high of $1.1 trillion in December, according to the New York Fed.As of October, just over 18% of the population had a 30-day or worse past-due payment on at least one credit account in the prior year, according to FICO. That’s up by 4% from April.“The apparent cumulative impact of higher interest rates, elevated consumer prices and economic uncertainty has put a financial strain especially on those consumers who heavily rely on credit cards to cover everyday expenses,” Arkali said.When consumers fail to repay their loans for a long time, banks write off the bad debt as a loss. Banks have increasingly been forced to do just that.The net charge-off rate on credit card loans climbed to 4.15% at the end of last year — the highest since early 2012, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said Thursday.Consumers continue to prioritize paying their mortgage and car loans.FICO said that while missed payments on mortgages and auto loans are still below pre-pandemic levels, missed payments on bank cards are now above pre-pandemic levels.The NY Fed recently found that credit card and auto loan delinquencies have climbed to the highest level in more than a decade, signaling “increased financial stress, especially among younger and lower-income households.”“There are some households that are under stress,” said Gus Faucher, PNC’s chief economist. “Inflation has hit lower-income households harder, and many of them have spent down their stimulus savings.”Still, Faucher said it’s “not terribly concerning” or surprising that FICO scores have dipped, because they were at record highs in 2022 when job growth was surging and consumers were flush with cash.The PNC economist pointed to a range of positive forces that should help American consumer balance sheets: Historically low debt burdens, a strong job market, rising household wealth thanks to booming home and stock prices and the fact that paychecks are growing faster than prices.“The overall outlook for consumer credit quality, and consumer spending growth,” Faucher said, “is still very solid.”"

        "title": "What to expect at work in 2024",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Welcome to the first business day of 2024.You may be wondering what this new year has in store for your career — your pay, your benefits, your schedule and your job prospects.To find out, we consulted with a number of workplace experts and consultants to get a sense of what trends and changes they expect.Many employees are likely to see raises that keep pace with — or even beat — inflation, which at last reading stood at 3.1%.A salary budget survey taken in December by workplace advisory firm WTW found that US employers are planning for an average salary increase of 4% in 2024. That is less than the 4.4% jump they offered in 2023 but above the average 3.1% increase seen in 2021 and earlier years.The size of the planned increases are due to inflation and concerns over a tight labor market, WTW said.Another recent survey by consulting firm Mercer found that employers expect to promote just under 10% of their employees this year. Those who are promoted will see a real jump in pay: “On average, employees can expect to see a 9.2% pay increase for a one-level promotion,” Mercer said.Many employers are expected to expand benefit offerings to better support their employees’ health, family lives and finances.Mercer, for instance, notes that employers are starting to apply their paid bereavement leave policy not only to situations when an employee’s immediate family member dies such as a parent, spouse or child but also when an extended family member, chosen family member or close friend does.Also rapidly growing is employers’ willingness to extend bereavement leave to employees after a pregnancy loss (e.g., through miscarriages and stillbirths), said Rich Fuerstenberg, a senior partner in Mercer’s health and benefits practice.Women employees going through menopause is another group employers will seek to support more. That includes making it less taboo to discuss menopause at work; raising employee (and manager) awareness of helpful benefits like work-flex options already on offer; giving women more control over their work environment; and at some employers, offering time off when needed.Expect, too, to see a wider variety of employers offer more financial wellness benefits in 2024. A Mercer employer survey conducted in September found that roughly a third of employers said they plan to start offering employee discounts, basic money management tools, tuition assistance and education about investing and financial planning. In addition, nearly 40% said they plan to add financial and debt counseling services. And a third said they will start offering student loan assistance.In addition, thanks to provisions taking effect this year under the retirement law Secure 2.0, your employer may opt to offer you one or more new benefits that will help you save more for retirement while simultaneously helping you to pay off your student loans or build up emergency savings.The idea of a four-day workweek has been discussed for years. But 2024 may be the year some employers across industries act on it — or at least take incremental steps toward making it a reality, according to Emily Rose McRae, who leads the future of work practice at consulting and research firm Gartner Inc., which will release its workplace predictions for 2024 later this week.“Some companies will ease into it,” McRae said, noting that may mean taking small, initial measures such as introducing Fridays off every other week or half-day Fridays.She anticipates some brand-name companies may even go further within the next year.Why? “There are twin pressures,” McRae said. One is the need to attract and retain talent at many levels across all industries. The other is the need to provide equity in their flexible work policies for front-line workers, whose jobs require them to be on site while their desk-based colleagues may be allowed to work from home for part of the week.McRae noted that research shows a four-day workweek can boost productivity if people get more rest as a result. But that requires being very deliberate in how one schedules a 4-day week for a team and being thoughtful about how and where work gets done in ways that don’t burn out employees.And what about hybrid work? For starters, it’s here to stay. “After three years of turmoil it finally looks like [work from home] has stabilized and 2024 will look a lot like 2023. … Overall levels of WFH in the US have been flat as a pancake since the beginning of 2023,” said workplace researcher and economist Nick Bloom of Stanford University.Employees who can work a hybrid schedule are generally working from home roughly 30% of the week (or about 1.5 days), Bloom noted. That is more than four times higher than the 7% recorded prepandemic.Apart from the general health of the job market, which still has more openings than job seekers, many more career opportunities may open up this year for those without a college degree or even years of experience for a given role. That’s due to an anticipated rise in skills-based hiring and an increasing use of artificial intelligence to assess competencies and potential among job candidates.Until now, a degree or work experience was seen as a proxy for the skills a hiring manager was looking for, McRae said. But given how many new skills are needed in jobs that never existed before (e.g., in artificial intelligence), coupled with fewer people getting degrees and a general talent shortage, companies are starting to eliminate degree requirements in job postings to gain access to a broader talent pool.No matter how human centric a role may be, most employees now need to have a base level of technical skills, said Anthony Reynolds, CEO at HireVue, an AI-driven recruiting platform.HireVue helps employers hire young college grads, hourly workers and professionals by culling applicants and offering tests to assess their skills and potential through games, tests and interviews, most of which are scored by an AI algorithm.Reynolds highlighted what he sees as the key benefits to this approach for job applicants. First, they decide when and how to take the tests. For example, someone with a busy work schedule may opt to take them via text or chat on their phone on a Sunday morning, he said.Secondly, if a person doesn’t get the job they applied for but their test scores suggest they would have the skills and potential for another open role they didn’t apply for, Reynolds said, HireVue offers clients the option of using an application called Find My Fit to let the candidate know about their suitability for that other role."

        "title": "House panel unanimously approves bill that could ban TikTok",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "A powerful House committee advanced a bill on Thursday that could lead to a nationwide ban against TikTok on all electronic devices, renewing lawmakers’ challenge to one of the world’s most popular social media apps and highlighting unresolved fears that TikTok may pose a Chinese government spying risk.The measure that sailed unanimously through the House Energy and Commerce Committee would prohibit TikTok from US app stores unless the social media platform — used by roughly 170 million Americans — is quickly spun off from its China-linked parent company, ByteDance.If enacted, the bill would give ByteDance 165 days, or a little more than five months, to sell TikTok. If not divested by that date, it would be illegal for app store operators such as Apple and Google to make it available for download. The bill also contemplates similar prohibitions for other apps “controlled by foreign adversary companies.”It’s the most aggressive legislation targeting TikTok to come out of a congressional committee since company CEO Shou Chew testified to lawmakers last year that the app poses no threat to Americans.“Today, we will take the first step in creating long-overdue laws to protect Americans from the threat posed by apps controlled by our adversaries, and to send a very strong message that the US will always stand up for our values and freedom,” said Washington Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the panel’s chair.New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, its ranking Democrat, compared the bill to prior efforts to regulate the US airwaves, citing testimony from national security officials from a closed-door hearing earlier Thursday.“I take the concerns raised by the intelligence community this morning very seriously,” Pallone said. “They have asked Congress to give them more authority to act in these narrowly defined situations, and I believe that this bill will do that.”The bill was introduced with some bipartisan support earlier this week by Wisconsin Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher, who chairs a House select committee on China, and the ranking member of that committee, Illinois Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi. The legislation also has the support of the White House and House Speaker Mike Johnson.Now that it has cleared the committee, the TikTok legislation will head to a floor vote next week, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said in a post on X Thursday evening. Its fate is less clear in the Senate, where there is no companion bill and the Democratic chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, has made no firm commitment to advance the proposal.“I will be talking to my Senate and House colleagues to try to find a path forward that is constitutional and protects civil liberties,” Cantwell said in a statement to CNN.House lawmakers voted unanimously in the same session Thursday to advance a second bill, one that would limit US companies’ ability to sell Americans’ personal information to foreign adversaries.US officials have cited the widespread commercial availability of US citizens’ data as another source of national security risk. The US government and other domestic law enforcement agencies are also known to have purchased US citizens’ data from commercial data brokers.TikTok is mounting a push against the bill, including trying to mobilize its user base.The company has served some users with full-screen pop-ups in the app warning that the bill “strips 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression.”“This will damage millions of businesses, destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country, and deny artists an audience,” reads the notification, a copy of which was reviewed by CNN.The call to action concludes with a link prompting users to dial their members of Congress and express their opposition to the bill. Multiple congressional staffers told CNN Thursday that House offices are being flooded with phone calls — in some cases in the hundreds — amid the campaign.Many of the calls appear to be coming from teenagers and the elderly, some of whom seem to be “confused” about why they are exactly calling or why TikTok might be at risk, one GOP aide told CNN.Speaking to reporters on the Capitol steps Thursday, Gallagher rejected characterizations of the bill as a TikTok ban.“It’s not a ban,” he said. “It puts the choice squarely in the hands of TikTok to sever their relationship with the Chinese Communist Party. As long as ByteDance no longer owns the company, TikTok can continue to survive. People can continue to do all the dumb dance videos they want on the platform, or communicate with their friends, and all that stuff. But the basic ownership structure has to change.”In a post on X, TikTok rejected lawmaker claims about the legislation providing options for TikTok.“This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,” the company wrote. “The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country.”During Thursday’s session, Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw dismissed criticisms that lawmakers didn’t understand the technology they were trying to regulate.“It’s not because we’re old, and grumpy, and don’t understand TikTok, and how you use it for your business, and how you use it to communicate with your friends,” Crenshaw said. “I was on social media long before any of the Gen Z-ers who are mad about TikTok. I understand.”In addition to potentially barring app stores from hosting TikTok, the bill could also restrict TikTok traffic or content from being carried by “internet hosting services,” a broad term that encompasses a variety of industries including “file hosting, domain name server hosting, cloud hosting, and virtual private server hosting.”That language could mean many more parts of the economy will be affected by the bill than just TikTok, Apple and Google.For years, US officials have warned that China’s intelligence laws could enable Beijing to snoop on the user information TikTok collects, potentially by forcing ByteDance to hand over the data.Policymakers fear the Chinese government could use the personal information to identify intelligence targets or to facilitate mass disinformation campaigns that could disrupt elections and sow other chaos.So far, the US government has not publicly presented any evidence the Chinese government has accessed TikTok user data, and cybersecurity experts say it remains a hypothetical albeit serious concern.They also say governments can already buy vast troves of personal data from data brokers or use commercial spyware to hack individual phones with ease.State and federal lawmakers have already banned TikTok from government-owned devices, but have repeatedly run aground in trying to broaden restrictions to Americans’ personal devices.Last year, Senate lawmakers proposed legislation clamping down on TikTok but triggered concerns that it could give the executive branch too much power.Efforts to ban TikTok date to the Trump administration, which used a series of executive orders to try to force app stores not to offer TikTok and to compel ByteDance to spin off the company. Those efforts also stalled amid legal challenges, though it led TikTok to engage in negotiations with the US government about how it could secure Americans’ personal data. Those talks are ongoing, even as TikTok has moved to store US user data on US-based servers controlled by the tech giant Oracle.In Montana, a federal judge last year temporarily blocked a statewide ban on TikTok, calling the legislation overly broad and threatening Montanan users’ First Amendment rights to access information through the app.A legislative factsheet from the sponsors of the House bill claims the proposal does not censor speech.“It is focused entirely on foreign adversary control—not the content of speech being shared,” the factsheet says.But the overall effect of the bill would still implicate Americans’ free speech rights, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.“We’re deeply disappointed that our leaders are once again attempting to trade our First Amendment rights for cheap political points during an election year,” said Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU. “Just because the bill sponsors claim that banning TikTok isn’t about suppressing speech, there’s no denying that it would do just that. We strongly urge legislators to vote no on this unconstitutional bill.”And the bill would also threaten the free-speech rights of tech powerhouses Apple and Google, said a major trade group representing those companies.“The government may not tell private parties, including digital service companies, what speech they may publish. The First Amendment forbids it,” said Stephanie Joyce, senior vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association. “The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would infringe the First Amendment rights of private businesses, including app stores, to curate and display content they believe is appropriate for their communities.”CNN’s Haley Talbot and Melanie Zanona contributed to this report."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Boeing is now party to a new federal investigation involving a 737 Max after United Airlines pilots reported that part of the flight controls became jammed as they landed in Newark last month.In a newly-released preliminary report of the February 6 incident, the National Transportation Safety board says the pilots of the Boeing 737 Max 8 “experienced ‘stuck’ rudder pedals during the landing rollout.” The rudder controls an airplane’s yaw, or the left and right swinging of the nose.The NTSB says none of the 161 people on United flight 1539 were injured and the plane returned to the gate, though United maintenance crews were able to “duplicate the reported rudder system malfunction” during a test flight three days later.The investigation is the latest to involve a nearly-new Boeing 737 Max aircraft following the door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 on January 5. The NTSB says in this latest incident, the 737 Max 8 was delivered from Boeing to United Airlines in February 2023.The NTSB says the servo in question was disabled by United Airlines, but cold temperature tests by the company that makes an autopilot servo that is connected to the 737 Max 8 rudder controls, Collins Aerospace, as part of the investigation revealed the servo’s “output crank arm would prevent the rudder pedals from moving.”“We’re grateful to our pilots and maintenance teams for their professionalism in diagnosing this issue. We’ll continue to work with Boeing, the NTSB and the FAA on next steps for these aircraft,” United said in a statement.This is the first instance of this issue being reported on a 737 Max, according to a source familiar with the matter, but not the first instance on any Boeing plane.A similar occurrence was reported twice, both in 2019, on the previous model of 737. That aircraft – the 737 Next Generation – uses a rudder pedal system. In both previous cases, the issue was fixed by replacing parts on the plane, the source said.“We worked closely with United Airlines to diagnose the rudder response issue,” Boeing said in a statement. “With coordination with United, the issue was successfully resolved with the replacement of three parts and the airplane returned to service last month.”United said the faulty parts are not part of the typical configuration used on its aircraft. The plane was originally built for another airline but went to United instead."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Amazon emailed its millions of Prime members this week, alerting them to an upcoming change to the streaming service that will leave customers with two options: pay more or watch ads.Starting January 29, Prime Video will feature “limited” advertisements, Amazon said in its email. To avoid ads, customers will have to pay $2.99 a month more. Amazon first announced the change in September.“This will allow us to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time,” Amazon said in its email to Prime members this week. “We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers.”Amazon is hardly alone in making the change. Prime Video is joining most other streaming services by inserting ads into its programming and raising prices on ad-free tiers.Netflix in October said its premium ad-free plan in the United States will increase by $3 per month, to $22.99. Its one-stream basic plan rose to $11.99 in the United States. All other plans, including its entry-level, $6.99-a-month ad-supported tier, remained at the same monthly cost.In August, Disney+ increased prices for the second time in less than a year, with the monthly cost of its ad-free plan rising to $13.99 in October — a $3 increase. Hulu, in which Disney owns a majority stake, will also hike its monthly ad-free subscription $3 to $17.99.Max, owned by CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, raised prices in January 2023 by $1 a month — its first-ever price hike. And Peacock, owned by NBCUniversal, also had its first-ever price hike in July.The price hikes come as streaming companies search for additional revenue. Consumer demand for streaming services has slowed dramatically since the pandemic, cutting into streamers’ revenue growth. Meanwhile, the cost for producing shows has risen, and it will continue to go up as the actors and writers’ new negotiated contracts kick in. Raising prices is one way to solve streaming companies’ financial issues.When Amazon first announced the change in September, it explained that ads will help it continue to produce popular programs, such as “Thursday Night Football.” Spending on Amazon’s content, which includes its original series, soared nearly 30% in 2022 to $16.6 billion.The company didn’t reveal how long the ad breaks will be. Prime Video, which is home to “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and “Citadel,” is included in the $139 yearly Prime subscription.Streaming services are no long chasing subscribers, but rather investors are pressuring them to make money off the services, even if it comes at the expense of losing subscriptions. As a result, they are selling ads or hiking monthly prices."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "The Washington Post Guild, the union that represents roughly 1,000 of the newspaper’s staffers, reached a tentative agreement Friday on a new contract with the Post’s management, a breakthrough after a year and a half of protracted and, at times, contentious talks that spilled into public view.“This is without question the best contract the Post Guild has won in half a century,” the union’s bargaining committee wrote in an email to members obtained by CNN. “Though it does not include everything we hoped to achieve, the bargaining committee supports ratifying this agreement, and we believe it will position our union to continue making The Post a better workplace in the next three years and beyond.”The tentative agreement comes after 18 months of negotiations that prompted hundreds of the newspaper’s staffers to walk off the job in a historic 24-hour strike earlier this month to protest the deadlocked talks and staffing cuts. The new contract, the union said, guarantees employees’ essential rights, secures raises across the board, and nearly doubles salary floors for the lowest-paid employees at The Washington Post.Under the tentative agreement, all union employees will receive an immediate $30 per week raise during the first payroll period of 2024. This increase will be combined with a 2.5% raise on April 1, as well as two additional 2% raises in both April 2025 and April 2026.In recent months, the Post announced it planned to slash its workforce with 240 voluntary buyouts by the end of the year. The union said members who are participating in the newspaper’s buyout program will also receive $500 bonuses when they sign their contracts. The Post, it said, also agreed to a 60-day notice period before amending the union’s current hybrid work arrangement.Members of the union will hold a vote next week to determine whether they will ratify the tentative contract. A simple majority of voters is required to ratify the agreement.In a statement Friday, The Washington Post confirmed it had reached a tentative agreement with the union.“It has always been our goal to reach an agreement that addresses the needs of our employees and our business,” the newspaper said. “We are confident this contract provides both and appreciate the efforts of all who have worked to make this happen. We are hopeful the contract will be ratified next week.”"

        "title": "The risks and rewards of a Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount merger",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Picture this: You select one app on your TV, phone or computer and everything you could ever dream of watching from live football games to “Succession” to just about every hit movie imaginable is all there.With Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount in talks for a potential merger, that could one day become the reality.WBD CEO David Zaslav met on Tuesday with Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish, and they broached a potential merger between the two companies, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. But an offer is not in the works, and one isn’t likely until the spring — if it happens at all.That’s because a tax provision that was used to facilitate the WarnerMedia and Discovery merger in 2022 would tax WBD more heavily if it pursues any additional mergers before April 8, 2024.The cost of a combined WBD-Paramount subscription would likely be more affordable than what you’d currently pay for the two services individually, said Jack Kranefuss, a senior director at Fitch Ratings who specializes in rating US-based media companies.Consumers would see the biggest savings for an ad-tier subscription as opposed to an ad-free one, he added. That’s because the combined subscription would become a lot more appealing to advertisers and lead them to ramp up spending.“Ultimately, the goal is reach. The more reach you provide advertisers, the more they like it,” Kranefuss said.That’s of course assuming a deal survives the inevitable regulatory hurdles it would face. But there’s another not-so-little problem: both companies are saddled with mountains of debt.“It may not be a perfect marriage if a deal goes ahead,” Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note on Thursday.Spokespeople for Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment on the potential merger.Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN, has been cutting costs and impressing Wall Street with its ability to unload its debt burden after it merged with Discovery in 2022. But it still held a stunning $45.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, down from $49.3 billion at the start of 2023.Buying Paramount would not help Warner Bros. Discovery’s effort to unwind its debt burden: Paramount has $15.7 billion in debt, a total that has barely budged all year.For Warner Bros. Discovery to share some of Paramount’s debt burden, both parties would likely look to sell some of their assets to reduce their combined debt and lower their overall expenses, Kranefuss said. For instance, he said he could see Paramount selling Black Entertainment Television or CBS.“Whether or not that would be sufficient enough for investors to feel comfortable remains to be seen,” Kranefuss added.There’s even a possibility that a deal could make it more expensive for Warner Bros. Discovery to pay off its existing debt.So far, investors don’t appear to be in favor of a combination.Since news of the potential deal broke on Wednesday afternoon, shares of Warner Bros. Discovery have dropped by over 5%, while Paramount’s stock rose initially on the report but returned to the level it was trading at before the report came out."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Customers of New York Community Bank (NYCB) pulled $6 billion worth of deposits between February 5 and March 5, leaving the bank’s deposit base 7% lower, at $77 billion.However, the pattern is not indicative of a bank run, which these days can drain a lender of funds in mere hours. Shortly ahead of its demise, depositors at Silicon Valley Bank tried withdrawing $42 billion in one day over fears they wouldn’t be able to access their funds if the bank failed.NYCB provided the updated figures on an investor conference call Thursday morning after it announced it secured a $1 billion investment from former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s firm, Liberty Strategic Capital, among other private equity companies.Shares of NYCB opened 13% higher Thursday morning after a rollercoaster of a day Wednesday when the stock plunged more than 40% at one point.Before the company disclosed in a filing last Thursday it had identified “material weakness” in the company’s controls, there weren’t significant changes in the bank’s level of deposits, said Alessandro DiNello, NYCB’s outgoing CEO, appointed just last week.“Friday was not a great day,” he said. “Over the weekend, Monday and Tuesday deposits were strong again.”But when a Wall Street Journal story was published Wednesday saying the bank was actively looking for a cash infusion, “there certainly were some people that lined up to withdraw [their money],” DiNello said. But after the $1 billion investment was announced, “it was back to normal.”NYCB has been in crisis mode since the regional lender reported a surprise loss of $252 million last quarter, compared to a $172 million profit in the fourth quarter of 2022. That caused the stock to plunge, bringing it to its lowest level since 1997.Additionally, NYCB was recently downgraded to junk status by both Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. That’s significant because many depositors often require banks to have higher credit ratings considered “investment grade” to keep their money there.On Thursday’s call, NYCB also announced it’s slashing its dividend to one penny a share. This comes after the company announced in January it was cutting its dividend from $0.17 a share to $0.05 a share.The looming concern from an investor standpoint is how aggressive the Long Island-based bank will be when it comes to setting aside more reserves and estimating how much it expects to lose from soured loans.Increasing both means the bank has fewer funds available to lend, which as a result would limit its profitability.NYCB executives on Thursday’s call declined to comment on any specifics, noting that they need more time to perform a proper analysis."

        "title": "Shawn Fain, CNN Business’ labor leader of the year, plans to keep automakers sweating",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The longest US auto strike this century is over after a pretty clear win for the United Auto Workers union at all three unionized automakers. But don’t think the union is moving to repair relations between labor and management the way it has after past strikes.The union and the automakers typically talked a good game about cooperation when there isn’t a strike going on.“I don’t like what I’ve seen in my work career with the UAW leadership, where they were too damn close to the companies,” UAW President Shawn Fain told CNN earlier this month.But when asked if things work better for his members when there’s a less contentious or more contentious relationship between the UAW and the Big Three, Fain responded, “We just negotiated the most successful contracts in our history,” he said. “For the last 30 years that I’ve been a member, we went backwards. So I like to let the body of work speak for itself.”The success of those contracts is the reason that Shawn Fain is CNN Business’ labor leader of the year.CNN Business has been naming a “CEO of the year” for many years now, but this year’s success of unions winning significant wage increases, often by waging high-profile strikes, pointed to the need for a labor leader of the year as well.And for a change, we saw numerous candidates from which to choose.It could have been Teamsters union President Sean O’Brien, who won a record contract at UPS without actually having to take more than 340,000 members there on strike.It could have been Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA, who led her union of 160,000 actors on 118-day strike that, together with a strike by 11,000 members of the Writers Guild of America, resulted in both improved wages and protections from the use of artificial intelligence, an issue of growing importance for a broad range of workers.It could have been a much lower profile union leader, such at Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer and chief negotiator for the Culinary workers union in Las Vegas who negotiated deals for 35,000 workers at 18 casinos along the Las Vegas Strip.Or maybe the leaders of a coalition of unions at Kaiser Permanente, where a three-day strike that was the largest work stoppage in US history resulted in significant pay and staffing improvements that members were seeking.All told nearly 800,000 union members got raises of 10% or more during 2023. But in many ways the most significant are the contracts negotiated by Fain for the 145,000 members at General Motors, Ford and Stellantis.The deal included immediate raises of at least 11%, plus an additional 14 percentage point of raises during the life of a contract that runs through April of 2028.It included the return of cost-of-living adjustments, which together with the guaranteed raises, are likely to raise wages by more than 30% during the contract.It included the end of lower-paid wage tiers and the conversion of lower-paid temporary workers to permanent employees, changes that will raise some wages between 80% to 150%. It got a closed factory at Stellantis reopened and the right to strike again to protest future plant closings.“I thought it was a grand slam,” said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations. “They got massive increases for newer workers. For the existing workforce it was extremely good, better than I would have imagined.”But perhaps the biggest win for the union was winning the chance to eventually have these contracts cover workers who will be building batteries for electric vehicles, or EVs, at plants now under construction.All the automakers have announced plans to shift from traditional gas-powered cars to EVs in coming years, a change that could bring an end to tens of thousands of union jobs building engines and transmissions.The dozen EV battery plants planned by the three unionized automakers are to be owned and run by joint ventures, so the employees would not necessarily have been UAW members. And even if they did vote to join the union, most expected they would be paid a fraction of what UAW members at the automakers get paid..Many experts think this was the most significant win for the union in a contract full of union wins.“I think that was the piece I didn’t expect,” said Jeff Schuster, global head of automotive for GlobalData, an industry consultant. “It was tough to see that happening heading into negotiations. It’s a big win for them.”Despite the contracts’ gains, some within the union’s rank-and-file objected. Nearly a third of members at Ford and Stellantis voted not to ratify the deals, and 45% of members at GM voted no.The union missed on a few goals such as a return of retiree health care coverage and a traditional pension plan for workers hired since 2007. Fain even floated the idea of getting a four-day, 32-hour work week without any drop in pay, an idea he said he still intends to pursue in the future.Fain said he doesn’t see the no votes during the ratification vote as a criticism of him or union leadership.“I’m proud of the results,” he said. “I think it’s a testament to the companies that they better understand that workers have high expectations, and they’re tired of watching companies make billions and billions in profits and at the expense of their lives.”To the criticism of the deals, and in some cases of him, expressed in comments during his Facebook Live remarks to members, he was straightforward.“Look, I agree with some of it,” he said. “We were trying to undo decades of going backwards in one agreement. That was a massive, massive challenge. You know, we achieved things in his contract that people said would never happen.”Fain has perhaps set an even more ambitious goal in the coming year, as he launched an attempt to organize workers at the US plants of foreign automakers, as well as nonunion EV makers such as Tesla and Rivian.It’s an effort the union tried before, but always failed. But with more than half of US autos now made at nonunion plants, and with UAW membership down by 300,000, or 45% since the start of the century, it’s crucial to the union’s continued success, perhaps even its survival.Many of the other automakers are responding to the union’s negotiating success, and its organizing efforts, by announcing pay increases of their own, what Fain is referring to as the “UAW bump.”He said those pay raises won’t hurt the union’s efforts to organize, and that it’s the workers at those nonunion plants, not the union, driving the organizing efforts.“This is a movement from the [nonunion] workers, not the UAW,” he said.Fain was elected in May in the first popular election the union had ever held for its leadership. Only union officers could vote to pick UAW presidents in the past.But a scandal that sent two former presidents to prison for misusing union funds, plus other union and company officials going to prison for bribery, resulted in the union agreeing to a consent decree with the Justice Department that brought the first union vote.Even with a popular election now held, Fain admits he was an underdog when he entered the race just over a year ago. He was a union official and staffer from a Chrysler plant in Kokomo, Indiana, who had never been elected to a national office at the union.“Look at everything that was against us in that race against me in that race. I mean, you’re taking on an establishment of power that has been in place longer than I’ve been alive,” he said. “I believed that our membership was ready for change. That’s why I ran. I believed the majority of our membership, just like myself, was frustrated.“But me running for this, it was it was honestly an act of faith,” he said. “The fact that no one really literally knew who I was other than Chrysler people. It wasn’t like I was well known throughout the country with our membership.”He survived the first round of voting, placing him in a runoff with Ray Curry, the incumbent president who had taken office in the wake of the scandal.In May, he won a vote by just more than 500 votes. And he had to hit the ground running to prepare for negotiations with contracts with all three automakers set to expired at 12:01 am ET on September 15.He immediately made it clear this would be a different kind of negotiation.The talks between the companies and the union always previously started with the union president and the CEO of each company posing for a photo shaking hands across the negotiating table.Fain refused to do so.More importantly, the union had always picked one of the three automakers as a “target” of negotiations, seeking a deal, perhaps via a strike, while granting an extension and staying on the job at the other two automakers.Once a deal was reached, it would try to get the other two automakers to agree with the pattern set at the negotiating target.But Fain and the union’s leadership kept telling the automakers and the media that it wasn’t going to do that this time, that it was prepared to strike all three at the same time for the first time in its history.Not many believed he would follow through with that threat. He did.Having a strike by all 145,000 members at the same time would drain the union’s $825 million strike fund that paid out $500 a week in benefits to strikers, in roughly three months.But Fain and the union decided on a different strategy, a targeted strike that began with one assembly plant at each company, and only 12,700 members being on strike.Then, as negotiations dragged on, he expanded the strike six different times as a way of increasing pressure on the automakers. Eventually about 60,000 members were on strike at one point or another.The unprecedented strategy is what resulted in the negotiating victory according to experts who followed the strike.“I think what was surprising, the unpredictability and tactics that he chose,” said GlobalData’s Schuster. “The approach was very unconventional and he did very well for the UAW in terms of what they did get.”Fain’s rhetoric was particularly harsh during the strike. He appeared on one of his Facebook Live talks announcing an expansion of the strike wearing an “Eat the Rich” T-shirt.He was accused of waging class warfare, and of making demands that would bankrupt companies.But soon after the deals, General Motors announced it had enough money to spend $10 billion in repurchasing shares of its stock to benefit its investors. The other automakers said they would remain profitable.Fain said he’s fine with the companies’ success, as long as his members get their fair share.“We want companies to succeed,” he said. “You know, our members take pride in the companies they work for, they take pride in the product they build. But we’re not going to be the sacrificial lambs and have everything be done on their backs anymore. [Having the companies] rake in billions in profits and just keep enriching themselves, those days are over.”"

        "title": "This social app prohibits edited photos to encourage users to be more authentic. It’s growing fast",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Scoot over, Facebook and Instagram.There’s a newer photo-sharing app – and it’s not like other social media platforms.The app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance.We joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it.BeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users – at least 65% – have signed up this calendar year.As its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they’re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life.It has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that’s what people will see.The result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms.The concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it’s time to “BeReal.” That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you’re doing, no matter how mundane.There’s no set time – the notification comes at random times of the day – adding to the app’s mystique.“Push notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,” the company said in a statement. “It’s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it’s not random.”That means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you’re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo – a selfie and one showing what’s in front of you. (BeReal doesn’t permit videos yet.)The result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things – lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner.With only one post a day, there’s no clutter of friends’ pictures to mindlessly scroll through. You can only see friends’ posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time.Georgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August.“What I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. … solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,” says Telerski, a junior majoring in government.Telerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms.“I try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,” he says. “I think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.”When you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what’s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie.The app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you’re ready.BeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity.BeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via its college ambassador program, which allows students to host events that educate others about the app.Telerski believes the app is popular because it’s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online.“I have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,” he says.Morgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend’s suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people’s lives.“It’s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren’t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,” she says. “It’s something different.”In a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create “an alternative to addictive social networks” that focus on amassing influence, it says.“BeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,” the company says. “BeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.”The app doesn’t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos.But some users may still try to curate their lives on the app.“There is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,” Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says.“It is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,” he says. “BeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.”The young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps.Nott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal – and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well.Telerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says.“For those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,” he says.“Think about what social media was originally intended for – real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Baidu’s bid to expand its live streaming business in China and diversify its revenue has suffered a blow with the collapse of a planned $3.6 billion acquisition.The Chinese tech giant announced Monday that one of its affiliate companies had terminated a 2020 agreement with Nasd﻿aq-listed Joyy (YY), the owner of popular live streaming platform YY Live.The deal fell through because certain conditions had not been met by the final deadline of December 31, Baidu (BIDU) said in ﻿a Monday filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, including obtaining the “necessary regulatory approvals.”Joyy said in a statement that it had received a notice from Baidu’s affiliate on Monday asserting its right to “effectively cancel the transaction.” The live streaming company, which owns several platforms and has about 277 million active monthly users globally, said it was seeking legal advice.Baidu, China’s dominant search engine, announced in November 2020 that it had agreed to buy YY Live in an attempt to grow its revenues from sources other than advertising, and that it expected the deal to close in the first half of 2021.Baidu CEO Robin Li said at the time that the acquisition would “catapult Baidu into a leading platform for live streaming and diversify our revenue source.”Like other live streaming platforms in China, YY Live makes money from users who buy virtual gifts for performers.Joyy reported net revenues of $567.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, down from $586.7 million in the same period the previous year. Live streaming revenues fell by nearly 9% to $495.8 million.In late 2020, Chinese authorities started clamping down on what it saw as overly powerful companies, with a particular focus on Big Tech. But as China’s economic outlook deteriorates, Beijing has shown signs of easing the crackdown, frequently talking up tech companies’ role in the economy."

        "title": "Tensions boil inside The Washington Post amid union standoff, questions over new CEO",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The Washington Post’s incoming chief executive and publisher will start the job with a mess on his hands.William Lewis, the veteran media executive who is set to take the reins of the renowned newspaper in January, will arrive to a newsroom in turmoil with sagging morale as contract negotiations between the Post’s leadership and unionized staff remain deadlocked, hundreds of employees depart, and questions are renewed about Lewis’ role in a decade-old phone hacking scandal.On Wednesday, members of the union that represents roughly 1,000 newsroom employees stormed the Post’s daily editorial meeting, clashing with executive editor Sally Buzbee and interim chief executive Patty Stonesifer over the contract talks stalemate, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.The Washington Post Guild, the union that represents staffers, has been negotiating with executives on a new contract for a year and a half, but it has yet to reach an agreement. Wages and staff reductions have remained a major sticking point between the two sides, causing dismay among union members with the newspaper’s management.Adding to the frustrations, The Post, which aimed to slash its workforce with 240 voluntary buyouts by the end of the year, has now exceeded its goal, prompting the newspaper’s management to offer financial incentives in a bid to retain some employees, the union told its members this week in an email obtained by CNN.A person familiar with the matter told CNN that the Post had resorted to offering some staffers generous bonuses to remain at the newspaper. Reached for comment, a spokesperson for the Washington Post pointed to a memo sent by Stonesifer to the newspaper’s staff on Tuesday emphasizing that “the number of people accepting the Voluntary Separation package has met our goal for 2024.” The spokesperson did not respond to further questions concerning the offers to retain staff.“The company wants us to believe that hitting its caps meant that 240 of our colleagues saw the buyout as a gift,” the Guild said in the email. “They were threatened with layoffs and made to feel undervalued, disrespected and disposable.”“And now, because of those threats, the company seems to have exceeded its buyout goal — and is now panicking,” it added.The Post’s management has so far rejected the union’s wage demand and has yet to directly confirm whether remaining staffers’ positions are safe from cuts, the union said.One Post staffer on Thursday described the atmosphere to CNN as “emotionally raw,” with numerous departing employees sending goodbye notes. The staffer, who sympathized with the need to be more financially stringent, said management however had behaved in a “tone deaf” manner as emotions coursed through the newsroom.Amid the union standoff, tensions at the Post were inflamed once again on Wednesday after a widely-read NPR article reported that Lewis, the newspaper’s 54-year-old incoming chief, allegedly assisted in the cover-up of “criminal activity when he was acting outside public view” while working a decade ago for Rupert Murdoch’s publishing empire.The allegations stem from recent lawsuits brought against News Corp.’s U.K. newspapers by Prince Harry and Hugh Grant, which allege that Lewis attempted to hamper government officials and deleted incriminating emails to shield Murdoch’s outlets from the sweeping fallout from the News of the World phone-hacking scandal.Lewis, the former editor of The Daily Telegraph and publisher of The Wall Street Journal — the latter of which is owned by Murdoch’s News Corp. — also allegedly attempted to engage in damage control for Murdoch’s U.K. tabloid, The Sun.Lewis addressed the allegations in an interview with the Post last month. “I took a view very early on that I’m never going to talk about it,” he said. “And it’s either right or wrong that I’ve done that.” He has previously denied the allegations.Stonesifer, speaking to the Post for the same article, said that Lewis “didn’t shy away” from making tough decisions over the course of his 30-year career. “That kind of bold leadership was part of what we were actually looking for. And believe me, we did our homework to determine whether that leadership went too far,” she said.A spokesperson for the Post did not comment on the allegations.Both the buyouts and NPR report come less than two weeks after 750 Post staffers walked off the job in a historic 24-hour strike, protesting the staff cuts and applying pressure on management to negotiate on a new contract in good faith.On Thursday, departing staffers were sent an email from management encouraging them to buy official merchandise emblazoned with the Post’s logo.“Before your last day at The Post, make sure you stop by The Post Store to take advantage of special employee pricing on products, including alumni gear,” it said. “You will not be able to access discounted rates after your last day at The Post.”A spokesperson for the Post told CNN “the message was included in error and is no longer part of any Washington Post employee departure communication.”Still, the email left staffers irritated, with some calling it “tone deaf” and “outrageous.”"

        "title": "The Rivian R2 and R3 are Rivian’s smaller, more affordable off-road EVs",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Rivian, the electric vehicle startup known for its of-road capable truck and SUV models, has unveiled two new, more affordable SUVs that the company hopes will take its sales to a new level.Currently, Rivian sells only two models, the big R1T SUV and the the R1S pickup, priced starting around $70,000 and $75,000, respectively. The new SUVs, called the R2 and R3, will be smaller and much less expensive.Prices for the R2 SUV, which will go on sale in early 2026, will start at around $45,000, Rivian said. At that price, it will still be relatively costly but it’s at least closer to an entry-level luxury vehicle, rather than at the high end.The R3 will cost even less than the R2, but Rivian didn’t provide any more specific pricing for that model. It will also be smaller, about 5 inches shorter, front to back, than the R2 and with a more sloped rear profile.The R2 is roughly the length of a Chevrolet Equinox, and neither the R2 and R3 will have a third row of seats. That’s something that set the larger R1S apart among electric SUVs, few of which can seat more than five.The new SUVs will be available in single-motor versions, which will have rear-wheel-drive. There will also be all-wheel-drive versions with either two or three motors. Three-motor versions will be able to accelerate from a stop to 60 miles an hour in under three seconds, according to Rivian. The R3 will be offered in a special high-performance model called the R3X.Although Rivian did not disclose specific performance numbers for the R3X, chief executive R.J. Scaringe described it as something like an off-road rally racing car.“It’s not a rock crawling vehicle, but it’s more of a a higher speed type of vehicle,” he said in an interview with CNN. “You do trails and exploring, but it’s a very high performance vehicle.”When purchased with larger optional battery packs, the R2 and R3 will be able to go over 300 miles on a full charge, according to Rivian. The SUVs will be able to fast-charge on either Tesla’s NACS chargers, or on the current industry standard CCS chargers. Like most other automakers, Rivian is planning to switch to the Tesla standard.In announcing the new vehicles, Scaringe also mentioned that plans for opening a second factory in Georgia, something the company had originally announced in 2021, were being postponed. He did not say how long those plans would be delayed, though.“The Georgia site still very much as part of our our strategy,” Scaringe said in an interview after new vehicles were unveiled.Rivian’s stock rose more than 13% Thursday. The stock had tumbled recently when the EV maker announced that 2024 sales wouldn’t be much higher than 2023 sales had been, at around 50,000 units. These new models, which won’t go on sale until at least the first half of 2026, won’t do anything to change that in the short term.And by moving into a lower price range, Rivian isn’t really avoiding competition, noted Sandeep Rao, an industry analyst with Leverage Shares, in an interview with CNN.Those in the middle and upper income segments of the US EV market are “spoiled for choices,” he said.“For $75,000 I can buy a Mercedes or a BMW, a 100-year-old Europe power house,” he said. “At 40,000, I can buy a Tesla.”Rivian will also face higher-end electric SUVs from Kia and Hyundai. But Rivian can set itself apart with vehicles that are actually capable of fairly serious off-road driving, something most electric SUVs don’t even pretend to be able to handle.But competition is coming, even on forest trails, as Volkswagen Group’s new Scout EV brand is almost directly aimed at Rivian’s customers. Scout, which recently started construction on a factory in South Carolina, expects to begin delivering its own off-road-capable electric truck and SUV models, priced close to the Rivian R2, in 2026, as well.Without naming Rivian, Scout chief executive Scott Keogh noted the advantage of Scout’s established brand name. “Scout” was the model name of an early SUV made by International Harvester, which was more typically known for heavy duty trucks and farm equipment.“Those who don’t know [the Scout name], when they do investigate it, that’s exactly what you want with a brand,” Keogh said in a recent CNN interview. “They say ‘Ah, look at the history! Look at the credibility, Look at the background,’ as opposed to a created name.”"

        "title": "BMW reveals its new $120,000 electric flagship",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Electric vehicles, with their need for lots of expensive batteries, have often trended towards luxury. Electric cars from Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi have all hit the market in recent years. BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i4 and now the new i7, a battery-powered take on the brand’s new most expensive sedan.While BMW is probably better known for its smaller 3 Series and 4 Series cars, the 7 Series is the brand’s showpiece for luxury and technology. The i7 is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday.With a starting price of $119,300, the all-wheel-drive 536 horsepower i7 xDrive60 will be able to go 300 miles on a full charge, which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air. It will also offer a V8-powered gasoline version, the 760i X-drive, with the same horsepower output and a starting price that’s $300 less. It will look almost identical. A gas-powered version with a 6-cylinder engine will have a starting price of $93,300.This new version also highlights BMW’s flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy, which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. While those other luxury brands’ electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models, BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge.BMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines, fully electric power or as plug-in hybrids that combine both electric and gas power. BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines. Instead, these vehicles have been designed, from the outset, to be built with any of these drive systems.A major benefit of doing it this way, BMW executives say, is that it gives the company flexibility to easily produce more – or fewer – electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs. With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either, the car maker also doesn’t risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets.Another benefit, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said, is that customers needn’t choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car. They can just decide they want to buy a BMW 7 Series, then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version, just as they might decide whether they want a V8 or a straight-6 engine. Either way, customers get the same luxury car experience and design.The downside of a common engineering platform is that, to enable both electric and gasoline power, designers need compromises. Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine, a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank, and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels. Electric cars, on the other hand, can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels, and while they don’t have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel, they need a large, relatively flat area, typically on the bottom of the car, for the batteries.The Mercedes EQS electric sedan, for example, has only a short hood that houses some electronic components, and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space.Zipse insisted the 7 Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source. The driving experience will be excellent, he said, as will interior comfort and technology.“There is no car with a more spacious, luxurious second row,” he said, during a meeting with journalists.Back seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car. In full-size sedans, there generally isn’t much more room (if any) in the front seats compared to smaller cars. The extra space usually goes to those in the back.As in many other high-end large cars, the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats. (BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors’, though.) The front passenger seat, if it’s unoccupied, can also move forward and fold down to allow more space.BMW 7 Series buyers can get an optional 31-inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers. Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light, the 7 Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someone’s own living room, according to BMW. Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked.Four-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway. Inside, there are few knobs and buttons. Instead, buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard.The car’s headlights are obscured by dark coverings while, above them, turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars. As an option, the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight. As another option, the 7 Series’ large “kidney” grille can be outlined in lights at night.For when the driver would rather not bother, assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways. This technology, similar to General Motors’ Super Cruise, requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times.The 7 Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app. It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course, such as around pylons in a parking garage, on its own, a feature somewhat similar to Tesla’s Summon mode.A sophisticated “head up display” which displays data in the car’s windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world. The system can also display parking regulations in the area.Performance is a core part of BMW’s brand image. For decades, BMW’s marketing tagline was: “The Ultimate Driving Machine.” Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmaker’s performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered. With the new 7 Series, the i7 shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V8-powered 760i. There are no plans for a V12-powered 7-series model in this generation of the car.A sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns. Computers can use data from GPS maps and cameras on the front of the car to predict when an upcoming curve will require the suspension system to react.BMW has said that half of the cars the company sells worldwide will be electric by 2030. That includes Rolls-Royce and Mini vehicles. Both of those iconic British brands are owned by BMW, and plan to sell only electric vehicles by 2030."

        "title": "Here’s where the minimum wage is increasing this year",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "For anyone working a minimum wage job in this new year, they will be paid more in 22 states and in at least 40 cities and counties across the country than they were in 2023.The higher hourly rates are due either to scheduled increases or lawmakers having indexed the minimum wage in their jurisdiction to inflation, most typically using the Consumer Price Index as their gauge.As of January 1, seven states and the District of Columbia will have minimum wages of $15 or more, up from just four states plus DC last year. The newcomers to the category are Maryland, New Jersey and most of New York State (with the exception of New York City, Westchester and Long Island, which already had a $15 minimum in place and where the minimum wage is increasing to $16 in 2024).The highest state minimum wage in 2024 will be Washington state, at $16.28, up from $15.74. A close second is California, which is raising its minimum to $16 from $15.50 on January 1.The state with the biggest jump in its minimum wage this year will be Hawaii, which is hiking it by $2.January 1 isn’t the only day minimum wages will go up. Some states, such as Nevada and Oregon, have increases set for July 1. Florida’s minimum will go up on September 30.(See the full list of states increasing their minimum wages below.)States’ minimum wage rates are often eclipsed by those in many of their own cities and counties.Take the city of Tukwila, Washington, just south of Seattle. Its minimum wage will hit $20.29 in January, up from $18.99 now. At that level it will have the highest standard minimum wage rate in the country among states, counties and cities as of January 1, said Jana Bjorklund, senior counsel and director of employment law and compliance at GovDocs, a compliance software provider for large, multi-jurisidiction employers.Seattle, which with a rate of $19.97, won’t be far behind.At least 40 cities and counties also are hiking their minimum wages, according to GovDocs. They include Flagstaff, Arizona (to $17.40); Mountain View, California (to $18.85); Denver, Colorado (to $18.29) and Portland, Maine (to $15).And in some states, there are big sector-specific wage hikes on tap. In California, for instance, starting in April, fast food workers must be paid at least $20 an hour, and on June 1, health care workers will start earning between $18 and $23 an hour depending on their role and the size and type of employer they work for — an hourly rate that will eventually reach $25.In New York City, app-based restaurant delivery workers (e.g., those working for Uber, Grubhub and DoorDash) now must be paid a minimum hourly rate of $17.96, which is set to increase to $19.96 by 2025.The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. And 20 states — including Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Alabama and Mississippi — still adhere to it.The push to raise it has gone on for years because minimum wage workers stuck at $7.25 have lost substantial buying power.Had it just been adjusted for inflation since 2009, it would be $10.33 today. But advocates for a higher minimum wage, including Holly Sklar, CEO of Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, would rather see it adjusted for inflation from where it was in 1968. The wage then was $1.60, which in today’s dollars would be $14.39. That $1.60 provided minimum wage workers with their greatest purchasing power, Sklar said. “Every minimum wage increase since 1968 has been too little too late. … Full-time jobs used to keep people out of poverty.”She points to MIT’s living wage calculator to assess what a single person without kids would have to earn per hour just to cover the cost of basic needs (e.g., food, housing, transportation and medical care).For example, in Mississippi, where the minimum wage is just $7.25, a person would have to earn $15.30 an hour in Pike County just to pay for basic needs. But among child care workers, fast food cooks and cashiers in the state, the median wage (meaning half of people in those jobs earn less) ranges between $9.83 and $10.17 an hour, Sklar noted.Given how little movement there has been at the federal level to raise the country’s minimum wage sufficiently, she expects states and local jurisdictions will continue to do the heavy lifting.And she believes the economic case for their increases is there for both workers and employers.For workers, of course, “It eases the burden,” Sklar said. “People replace tires they couldn’t replace or get their kids clothes.”For businesses, she said, consumer spending goes up because minimum wage workers will spend their additional earnings quickly. And among other things, it will help boost retention of one’s workers because they won’t be as quick to quit for another 25 cents an hour. Less turnover, in turn, can reduce an employer’s hiring and training costs, among other benefits.“It’s a virtuous cycle,” Sklar said.Alaska: $11.73, up from $10.85Arizona: $14.35, up from $13.85California: $16, up from $15.50Colorado: $14.42 (proposed), up from $13.65Connecticut: $15.69, up from $15Delaware: $13.25, up from $11.75Florida: $13, up from $12, on September 30Hawaii: $14, up from $12Ilinois: $14, up from $13Maine: $14.15, up from $13.80Maryland: $15, up from $13.25 for large employers and $12.80 for small employersMichigan: $10.33, up from $10.10Minnesota: $10.85 for large employers, up from $10.59; $8.85, up from $8.63 for othersMissouri: $12.30, up from $12Montana: $10.30, up from $9.95Nebraska: $12, up from $10.50Nevada: $12, up from a $10.25 or $11.25 (depending on health benefits) – effective July 1, 2024New Jersey: $15.13, up from $14.13New York: $15, up from $14.20 (except in New York City, Westchester and Long Island, where it is set at $16, up from $15)Ohio: $10.45, up from $10.10Oregon: Its $14.20 minimum wage will adjust for inflation on July 1Rhode Island: $14, up from $13South Dakota: $11.20Vermont: $13.67, up from $13.18Washington: $16.28, up from $15.74District of Columbia: Its $17 minimum wage will adjust for inflation on July 1*Unless otherwise noted, changes take effect January 1"

        "title": "Why Donald Trump’s Super Tuesday win is a defeat for Rupert Murdoch",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.Donald Trump just defeated Rupert Murdoch (again).With Nikki Haley exiting the presidential race, the twice-impeached, four-time indicted, insurrection-inciting former president has vanquished the field of Republican Party challengers to secure unbridled control over the GOP.That’s an outcome that Murdoch, the billionaire media mogul and one-time Republican kingmaker who controls Fox News, had hoped to avoid. Murdoch has privately leveled harsh criticism against Trump. And after the 2020 election, he even wrote in an email to a Fox News executive, disclosed during litigation with Dominion Voting Systems, “We want to make Trump a non person.”While Fox News never completely turned on Trump and blasted the election-denying president with its full might, the network did without question give him the cold shoulder as it flirted with other candidates in the Republican field over the last few years, most notably Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.Fox News eagerly propped up DeSantis post-2020, all while effectively blacklisting Trump for a time. Murdoch’s tabloid The New York Post even once declared DeSantis “DeFUTURE.” That was no accident.Trump himself understood that Murdoch has not wanted him to serve as the Republican nominee. Over the past few years, he has repeatedly raged at the media mogul on his Truth Social platform, blasting him for perceived slights and for having worked to elevate DeSantis.Some of this criticism has been unfair, as we’ve noted, given Fox News’ general refusal to throw actual elbows at Trump and still echo much of his dishonest rhetoric, repeatedly shielding him as he was hit with 91 criminal counts and civil fraud judgments worth hundreds of millions of dollars after exiting office. But Trump was not wrong in his assessment that Murdoch’s network certainly would have preferred to have had another candidate at the helm of the Republican Party.Now that Trump has secured command over the GOP, it is déjà vu for Murdoch. Eight years after Trump beat Fox News into submission during the 2016 race (remember when the network sparred openly with him over his trashing of then-anchor Megyn Kelly, among other things?), he has done the same again. That means that as the presumptive GOP nominee, Trump will once again have Fox News at his full disposal, able to wield the network like he did during his time in the White House as an effective political weapon, which he will harness in the weeks and months ahead against President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.Of course, the writing has been on the wall for Murdoch for some time now. And that has been reflected gradually in Fox News’ coverage. In recent months, the network has returned to its old ways, handing over its massive platform to Trump and allowing him to spread mis-and-disinformation. The reversal has even led Fox anchors to attack other outlets for having the courage to hold the wall against Trump’s lies and fact check his claims.With his victory in the primaries official, Trump has not only secured control over the GOP but regained command of his most powerful propaganda organ. Fox News — which will never support a Democratic candidate for president — is left with no real choice but to prop him up. Murdoch and his network executives know that if they were to dare not fall in line, Trump could batter the right-wing channel and encourage his legion of fans to switch over to Newsmax, as was the case in the immediate wake of the 2020 election.Put more simply: Trump has checkmated Murdoch, clearing one more hurdle standing in his way on the path to the White House."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Mortgage rates ticked down slightly this week, a tiny boon to buyers eager to make a move with newly listed homes coming to market.The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.88% in the week ending March 7, down from 6.94% the previous week, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the average 30-year fixed-rate was 6.73%.“Evidence that purchase demand remains sensitive to interest rate changes was on display this week, as applications rose for the first time in six weeks in response to lower rates,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement.Thursday’s decline caps a four-week streak of rising rates and will likely draw even more people to the spring market.Applications for mortgages were up 9.7% in the week ending March 1 from the week before, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.Applications for a loan to purchase a home were up 11% from a week earlier, while refinance applications rose 8% from a week earlier, on a seasonally adjusted basis — although both were below levels reached a year ago.Also, applications for Federal Housing Administration loans were up last week, demonstrating an interest from first-time homebuyers, according to the MBA report.Still, with homebuyers struggling in one of the least affordable markets in decades, mortgage rates are one of the biggest — and most persistent — hurdles for potential homebuyers, he said, in addition to stubbornly low inventory.“It’s important to remember that rates can vary widely between mortgage lenders, so shopping around is essential,” Khater added.More homes are coming to market, as is typical during the spring homebuying and selling season.New listings of homes for sale rose 13% year over year during the four weeks ending February 25, marking the biggest increase in nearly three years, according to Redfin.Total inventory is also improving. While active listings are flat from a year ago, February’s report from Redfin was notable because it marked the first time in nine months the total number of homes for sale hadn’t declined.On the buyers’ side, the increase in mortgage applications without much of a decrease in mortgage rates suggests that people looking for a home are currently more concerned about having more homes to choose from than they are about the financing costs.On the sellers’ side, the increase in new listings suggests that at least some homeowners can no longer wait for mortgage rates to fall in order to sell their home and become buyers themselves.New listings are up in 70% of the country’s metro areas, according to Bright MLS.“Conventional wisdom was that mortgage rates had to come down significantly in order to entice homeowners to sell,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, in a statement. “However, like with so much about the current housing market, conventional wisdom has not been exactly on target.”Sturtevant said many current home sales are being driven by people’s individual life changes like a marriage or a divorce, a new baby, or a need to be closer to aging parents.“People may have been putting off moving, hoping they would be able to sell when interest rates were lower, but those life circumstances have begun to outweigh the financial considerations for some,” she said.While mortgage rates are expected to fall further in 2024, Sturtevant added, short-term movements in mortgage rates will likely be influenced by congressional testimony given this week by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. During his semiannual monetary report to Congress, he indicated there is no rush to cut interest rates with more evidence of cooling inflation. The February jobs report, which will be released Friday, is also likely to have some bearing on mortgage rates. If the job numbers are quite strong, it will suggest that the economy is still growing at a healthy pace. That means the Fed is likely to push out its timeline for rate cuts."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "The United Kingdom has announced that it will scrap a 225-year-old rule that has allowed many of its richest residents to pay hardly any tax on their vast foreign earnings — a benefit enjoyed at one point by the prime minister’s wife.The axing of the non-domiciled tax regime represents an about-face for Britain’s Conservative government, which had previously rejected calls to abolish the so-called “non-dom” status, citing the risk that would pose to the country’s ability to attract globally mobile investors and wealthy foreigners with big spending power.“Those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share,” UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt told parliament Wednesday. “After looking at the issue over many months, I have concluded that we can, indeed, introduce a system which is both fairer and remains competitive with other countries.”There were an estimated 68,800 non-doms in the UK in 2022, according to HM Revenue & Customs, the UK’s tax collecting authority. Non-doms are people living in the UK but who claim to have a permanent residence in another country.The non-dom status means they can choose not to pay taxes on income and capital gains earned abroad for up to 15 years after arriving in Britain as long as they don’t transfer any of that money into the country.Many of them are extremely rich. In 2018, more than 40% of UK residents with income of £5 million ($6.4 million) a year claimed non-dom status, according to research from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and the University of Warwick.Under Hunt’s new rules, people moving to the UK will only be exempt from tax on foreign earnings for the first four years they are resident. The changes, which will come into effect from April 2025, will form part of a “modern, simpler, and fairer residency-based system,” Hunt said, and are expected to generate £2.7 billion ($3.4 billion) a year for the government by 2029.The non-dom regime is an “archaic colonial concept,” which determines a person’s tax status based on their “intended” place of residence, said Arun Advani, an economics professor at the University of Warwick.According to the London School of Economics, tax breaks for non-doms date back to 1799 when the government wanted to protect the aristocracy from paying tax on their properties in British colonies.In contrast, a residency-based system calculates the tax owed by a person based on how much time they spend in the country, which is the approach used by most other nations, Advani said.The changes were unveiled in Hunt’s budget announcement Wednesday, which included billions in tax cuts for workers ahead of the first general election since 2019. He also slapped higher taxes on business- and first-class airfares.The opposition Labour Party had previously said it would abolish the non-dom regime if it came to power, and spend the money raised on the National Health Service.Political pressure to abolish the system has built since 2022, when it transpired that Akshata Murty, the wife of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, was registered as a non-dom and claiming tax exemptions on earnings tied to her father’s software empire in India.Murty has since renounced those advantages, citing the “British sense of fairness” and the “distraction” her tax status posed to her husband, who was serving as the UK’s finance minister at the time.But in November 2022 Hunt defended the “non-dom” status.“I’m not going to do anything that’s going to damage the long-term attractiveness of the UK, even though it gives easy shots to opposition parties,” he told the BBC at the time, according to several reports in UK media.A spokesperson for the prime minister’s office said Wednesday that Sunak had not been involved in the development of the new “non-dom” tax rules “to mitigate against potential or perceived conflicts of interest.”“The prime minister was recused from all policy development and was only sighted on the policy once final decisions had been taken,” the spokesperson added.Lauren Kent contributed to this article."

        "title": "What to expect in Friday’s jobs report",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Don’t be surprised if Friday’s jobs report shows that February’s employment gains were far below those reported for January.Economists expect that US employers added 200,000 jobs last month, according to FactSet estimates. Such a tally pales in comparison to January’s whopping 353,000 job gains.But February’s estimated monthly total would still be nothing to scoff at. In fact, it would continue a history-making stretch of labor market expansion. Additionally, January’s seemingly jaw-dropping job gains came with their fair share of caveats (namely the influence of weather, annual seasonal adjustment factors and because fewer seasonal workers were likely laid off than in previous Januarys).Friday’s jobs report could very well provide a more reliable read on what’s actually happening in the labor market than the jobs reports of recent months’ past, Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told CNN.October’s and November’s reports had some bumpiness because of striking and returning autoworkers, writers and actors. December and, especially, January likely overstated growth.“And so, February might give us a better understanding of the underlying rate of job growth,” she said.The labor market is expected to cool further in 2024 from last year, when monthly gains averaged 254,667 jobs and from the roaring post-pandemic recovery years of 2022 and 2021, when job growth averaged 377,333 and 603,750 per month, respectively, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.Even so, the projected employment gains for February would be well above historical averages and the neutral rate of job growth needed to keep up with population growth (estimated between 70,000 to 100,000 jobs).Plus, if the job gains come in as expected and unemployment stays steady at 3.7%, it would continue what’s been the fifth-longest labor market expansion on record and continue a streak of sub-4% unemployment that hasn’t been seen since Nixon was in office.“Compared to 2021 and 2022, the party has ended, and now people are feeling the hangover,” Ron Hetrick, senior economist for labor analytics firm Lightcast, said Wednesday in a statement. “People think things are terrible now, but looking at the economy as a whole, we’re not seeing that in the data — things are fantastic, but we lost track of what ‘fantastic’ was when we experienced something completely unrealistic in ‘21 and ‘22.”Beyond the headline numbers, there are plenty of metrics to watch in Friday’s report. Here are a few:Wage growth: Average hourly earnings sharply rose in January, jumping 0.6% from December and climbing to 4.5% annually, amid a drop in hours worked (more on that later). Economists expect the pace of wage growth to moderate slightly, but not slow enough for the Federal Reserve’s liking.Central bankers are likely looking for annual wage growth to be in the 3.5% realm, Gus Faucher, PNC Financial Services’ chief economist, told CNN.Other data shows that wage growth is moderating. Payroll processor ADP reported Wednesday that “job-stayers” saw annual pay gains slow to 5.1% in February.Additionally, the BLS’ latest job turnover data released Wednesday showed the quits rate (the number of people quitting their jobs as a percentage of total employment) dipped to 2.1% in January, the lowest since April 2020. Higher quit rates typically correlate to higher wage and price inflation pressures.Average workweek: The BLS’ measure of average hours worked in a week typically holds steady or moves by only 0.1 hours on a monthly basis. However, in January, the metric dropped by 0.2 to 34.1 hours, landing at the lowest level since March 2020.The decrease, which contributed to the boost in the average hourly earnings data point, was likely due to the frigid temperatures and snow in January that affected work in weather-sensitive industries, Faucher said.However, if average weekly hours do shrink more, it could be a sign that economic activity is weakening.“Oftentimes when businesses see softer demand, the first thing they’ll do is they’ll cut back on hours, because they don’t want to have to lay people off,” he said. “If we see a bounce-back in hours worked, that would be an indication that labor demand is still pretty solid.”Where the jobs are and labor force participation: For much of the past year, the lion’s share of employment gains were concentrated in only three sectors: health care, leisure and hospitality, and government. January’s jobs report showed that the gains were in a wider swath of industries (including key industries such as construction and manufacturing), so economists are looking to see if that was a statistical blip.The labor force participation rate, which is an estimation of the active workforce and people looking for work, was unchanged in January at 62.5%.Labor force participation rates have been on a decline — largely due to demographic changes and aging Baby Boomers — since hitting a high of 67.3% in early 2000, and had fallen to 63.3% in the month before the onset of the pandemic. The participation rate has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, vexing economists and the Fed, while also contributing to an imbalance of worker supply and demand.Other economic data released this week reinforces the idea that the US labor market is cooling but remains on solid footing.Private-sector US employers added an estimated 140,000 jobs in February, ADP reported Wednesday. Last month’s total landed slightly below economists’ expectations for a net gain of 150,000 jobs but above ADP’s January tally, which was upwardly revised to 111,000 hires.“The economy still seems to be chugging along, and hiring is keeping up that pace,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said during a call with reporters on Wednesday.The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for January showed that job openings, hiring activity, quits and layoffs all moved downward. Still, the number of job openings — a closely watched measure of labor demand — remains well above pre-pandemic averages, highlighting the continued strength of the labor market. In January, there were an estimated 8.86 million available jobs, down from the upwardly revised 8.89 million in December.Layoff announcements, by some measures, remain elevated.In February, US-based companies announced 84,638 job cuts, a 3% increase from January and up 9% from February 2023, according to data released Thursday by outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.While the January-February tally is running about 8% below what was seen during the first two months of last year, Challenger noted that it’s the second-highest January-to-February total since 2009.“As we navigate the start of 2024, we’re witnessing a persistent wave of layoffs,” Andrew Challenger, the firm’s senior vice president, said in a statement. “Businesses are aggressively slashing costs and embracing technological innovations, actions that are significantly reshaping staffing needs.”Reports of localized layoffs show some “pockets of weakness” in the labor market, Lydia Boussour, EY senior economist, wrote in commentary issued Tuesday.“Still, real-time data such as initial and continued jobless claims indicate that layoff activity remains low across the economy,” she noted.New data released Thursday showed that first-time claims made last week for unemployment benefits were unchanged from the week before at 217,000. In the decade before the pandemic, weekly claims for unemployment benefits averaged 311,000, Labor Department data shows.Thursday’s report also showed that continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received unemployment benefits for one week or more, were 1.906 million for the week that ended on February 24, an increase of 8,000 claims from the prior week’s level that was revised down by 7,000.Continuing claims, which could give an indication of how easy it is for unemployed workers to find jobs, are at their highest level since mid-November 2023."

        "text": "A Google employee was charged Tuesday with stealing artificial intelligence trade secrets from the tech giant while secretly working with two Chinese-based companies in the AI industry.Linwei Ding, who also goes by Leon Ding, is charged with four counts of theft of trade secrets. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison for each count.“The Justice Department will not tolerate the theft of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies that could put our national security at risk,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Wednesday, adding that “we will fiercely protect sensitive technologies developed in America from falling into the hands of those who should not have them.”Ding, a 38-year-old Chinese national who lives in California, is accused of copying more than 500 files with confidential information from Google into his own personal account over the course of one year, beginning in 2022. The files included technology involved in the building blocks of Google’s advanced supercomputing data centers, prosecutors say.An attorney for Ding is not yet listed.As part of his responsibilities at Google, prosecutors say, Ding helped to develop the software deployed in Google’s supercomputing data centers. Because of that work, Ding had access to Google’s “hardware infrastructure, the software platform, and the AI models and applications they supported,” they say.A few months after Ding allegedly began copying Google’s files, he was offered the chief technology officer role for an “early-stage technology company” based in China, the Justice Department says. Ding allegedly traveled to China for several months, where he participated in investor meetings to raise money for the company, and potential investors to the company were told that Ding was an executive and owned 20% of the company’s stock.Ding took steps to conceal his work while in China, prosecutors say, including by having another employee use his badge to access his office so that it would look like he was in the United States.Within the next year, Ding founded his own technology company in the “AI and machine learning industry,” prosecutors say. The company allegedly applied to a Chinese-based startup program and boasted that “we have experience with Google’s ten-thousand-card computational power platform; we just need to replicate and upgrade it - and then further develop a computational power platform suited to China’s national conditions.”In a statement, Google said it conducted a thorough investigation into Ding’s alleged misconduct and quickly referred the case to the FBI. Ding was a junior employee, Google spokesperson José Castañeda told CNN, and the company monitors file transfers to cloud storage platforms including Google Drive and Dropbox.“We have strict safeguards to prevent the theft of our confidential commercial information and trade secrets,” Castañeda said. “After an investigation, we found that this employee stole numerous documents, and we quickly referred the case to law enforcement. We are grateful to the FBI for helping protect our information and will continue cooperating with them closely.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry.“We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo.“We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said.In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm’s “strong partnership” with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker’s biggest financial backer.The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving.The details of Altman’s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently “candid” with the board.That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman’s ouster was the presence of tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis.As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO.But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company’s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company’s board didn’t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO.It’s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman’s return. Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work … I’m glad to have been a part of the solution.”Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X.Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision.And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades.“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”Altman’s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out.Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he has pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly.“Is [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?” he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. “Or is it gonna be more like the atom bomb — huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?”But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit.Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI’s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft’s products.OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly been in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone.— CNN’s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting."

        "title": "House panel unanimously approves bill that could ban TikTok",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "A powerful House committee advanced a bill on Thursday that could lead to a nationwide ban against TikTok on all electronic devices, renewing lawmakers’ challenge to one of the world’s most popular social media apps and highlighting unresolved fears that TikTok may pose a Chinese government spying risk.The measure that sailed unanimously through the House Energy and Commerce Committee would prohibit TikTok from US app stores unless the social media platform — used by roughly 170 million Americans — is quickly spun off from its China-linked parent company, ByteDance.If enacted, the bill would give ByteDance 165 days, or a little more than five months, to sell TikTok. If not divested by that date, it would be illegal for app store operators such as Apple and Google to make it available for download. The bill also contemplates similar prohibitions for other apps “controlled by foreign adversary companies.”It’s the most aggressive legislation targeting TikTok to come out of a congressional committee since company CEO Shou Chew testified to lawmakers last year that the app poses no threat to Americans.“Today, we will take the first step in creating long-overdue laws to protect Americans from the threat posed by apps controlled by our adversaries, and to send a very strong message that the US will always stand up for our values and freedom,” said Washington Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the panel’s chair.New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, its ranking Democrat, compared the bill to prior efforts to regulate the US airwaves, citing testimony from national security officials from a closed-door hearing earlier Thursday.“I take the concerns raised by the intelligence community this morning very seriously,” Pallone said. “They have asked Congress to give them more authority to act in these narrowly defined situations, and I believe that this bill will do that.”The bill was introduced with some bipartisan support earlier this week by Wisconsin Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher, who chairs a House select committee on China, and the ranking member of that committee, Illinois Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi. The legislation also has the support of the White House and House Speaker Mike Johnson.Now that it has cleared the committee, the TikTok legislation will head to a floor vote next week, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said in a post on X Thursday evening. Its fate is less clear in the Senate, where there is no companion bill and the Democratic chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, has made no firm commitment to advance the proposal.“I will be talking to my Senate and House colleagues to try to find a path forward that is constitutional and protects civil liberties,” Cantwell said in a statement to CNN.House lawmakers voted unanimously in the same session Thursday to advance a second bill, one that would limit US companies’ ability to sell Americans’ personal information to foreign adversaries.US officials have cited the widespread commercial availability of US citizens’ data as another source of national security risk. The US government and other domestic law enforcement agencies are also known to have purchased US citizens’ data from commercial data brokers.TikTok is mounting a push against the bill, including trying to mobilize its user base.The company has served some users with full-screen pop-ups in the app warning that the bill “strips 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression.”“This will damage millions of businesses, destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country, and deny artists an audience,” reads the notification, a copy of which was reviewed by CNN.The call to action concludes with a link prompting users to dial their members of Congress and express their opposition to the bill. Multiple congressional staffers told CNN Thursday that House offices are being flooded with phone calls — in some cases in the hundreds — amid the campaign.Many of the calls appear to be coming from teenagers and the elderly, some of whom seem to be “confused” about why they are exactly calling or why TikTok might be at risk, one GOP aide told CNN.Speaking to reporters on the Capitol steps Thursday, Gallagher rejected characterizations of the bill as a TikTok ban.“It’s not a ban,” he said. “It puts the choice squarely in the hands of TikTok to sever their relationship with the Chinese Communist Party. As long as ByteDance no longer owns the company, TikTok can continue to survive. People can continue to do all the dumb dance videos they want on the platform, or communicate with their friends, and all that stuff. But the basic ownership structure has to change.”In a post on X, TikTok rejected lawmaker claims about the legislation providing options for TikTok.“This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,” the company wrote. “The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country.”During Thursday’s session, Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw dismissed criticisms that lawmakers didn’t understand the technology they were trying to regulate.“It’s not because we’re old, and grumpy, and don’t understand TikTok, and how you use it for your business, and how you use it to communicate with your friends,” Crenshaw said. “I was on social media long before any of the Gen Z-ers who are mad about TikTok. I understand.”In addition to potentially barring app stores from hosting TikTok, the bill could also restrict TikTok traffic or content from being carried by “internet hosting services,” a broad term that encompasses a variety of industries including “file hosting, domain name server hosting, cloud hosting, and virtual private server hosting.”That language could mean many more parts of the economy will be affected by the bill than just TikTok, Apple and Google.For years, US officials have warned that China’s intelligence laws could enable Beijing to snoop on the user information TikTok collects, potentially by forcing ByteDance to hand over the data.Policymakers fear the Chinese government could use the personal information to identify intelligence targets or to facilitate mass disinformation campaigns that could disrupt elections and sow other chaos.So far, the US government has not publicly presented any evidence the Chinese government has accessed TikTok user data, and cybersecurity experts say it remains a hypothetical albeit serious concern.They also say governments can already buy vast troves of personal data from data brokers or use commercial spyware to hack individual phones with ease.State and federal lawmakers have already banned TikTok from government-owned devices, but have repeatedly run aground in trying to broaden restrictions to Americans’ personal devices.Last year, Senate lawmakers proposed legislation clamping down on TikTok but triggered concerns that it could give the executive branch too much power.Efforts to ban TikTok date to the Trump administration, which used a series of executive orders to try to force app stores not to offer TikTok and to compel ByteDance to spin off the company. Those efforts also stalled amid legal challenges, though it led TikTok to engage in negotiations with the US government about how it could secure Americans’ personal data. Those talks are ongoing, even as TikTok has moved to store US user data on US-based servers controlled by the tech giant Oracle.In Montana, a federal judge last year temporarily blocked a statewide ban on TikTok, calling the legislation overly broad and threatening Montanan users’ First Amendment rights to access information through the app.A legislative factsheet from the sponsors of the House bill claims the proposal does not censor speech.“It is focused entirely on foreign adversary control—not the content of speech being shared,” the factsheet says.But the overall effect of the bill would still implicate Americans’ free speech rights, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.“We’re deeply disappointed that our leaders are once again attempting to trade our First Amendment rights for cheap political points during an election year,” said Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU. “Just because the bill sponsors claim that banning TikTok isn’t about suppressing speech, there’s no denying that it would do just that. We strongly urge legislators to vote no on this unconstitutional bill.”And the bill would also threaten the free-speech rights of tech powerhouses Apple and Google, said a major trade group representing those companies.“The government may not tell private parties, including digital service companies, what speech they may publish. The First Amendment forbids it,” said Stephanie Joyce, senior vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association. “The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would infringe the First Amendment rights of private businesses, including app stores, to curate and display content they believe is appropriate for their communities.”CNN’s Haley Talbot and Melanie Zanona contributed to this report."

        "title": "OpenAI’s wild week. How the Sam Altman story unfolded",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week’s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating.Sam Altman — the leader of one of the world’s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the most visible figure in the fledgling industry — was fired Friday night by the startup’s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he’s back as the company’s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision.The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot.If you’re just catching up, here’s what you missed from a week so incredible you’d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI’s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public.Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board.Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO.OpenAI’s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman’s ouster just minutes before the board’s announcement.Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he “loved working with such talented people” and that he would have “more to say about what’s next later.”Brockman promptly quit. “Please don’t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,” Brockman said in a Friday post on X. “Greater things coming soon.”A key factor in the CEO’s firing was tension between Altman, who favored developing AI more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events.Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture.OpenAI’s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return.By Sunday afternoon, Altman was back at OpenAI’s headquarters — this time with a guest badge — to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman’s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO.But those talks broke down.As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon’s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI’s chief technology officer.In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as “a once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman’s firing.But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company’s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met.Altman posted on X, saying, “we have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i’m so excited. one team, one mission.”The drama was far from over. The Verge reported Monday afternoon that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign.And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was “open to both options” when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft.“Look, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,” Nadella said. “We chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.”Altman was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI’s CEO, the company said on X.“We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo.“We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said.In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm’s “strong partnership” with Microsoft.It’s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman’s return. Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work … I’m glad to have been a part of the solution.”Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X.Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI.“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”"

        "title": "Germany is gripped by strikes and Lufthansa is hurting",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Germany’s biggest airline has warned that ongoing strikes by thousands of its ground staff and airport workers could hurt its earnings this quarter, after walkouts earlier this year already cost the company more than $100 million.Lufthansa Group, which owns German flag carrier Lufthansa and several smaller airlines including Austrian Airlines and Eurowings, said Thursday that it expected to suffer a bigger operating loss in the first three months of 2024 than a year ago, partly because of the industrial action.Strikes by Lufthansa’s ground staff over the past few weeks have so far cost the company nearly €100 million ($109 million) in direct costs, chief financial officer Remco Steenbergen said at a press conference Thursday.The strikes have also discouraged numerous customers from booking flights — particularly last-minute ”profitable” flights — resulting in a ”significant sales loss” for the company, he added.The bumpy start to the year follows a stellar 2023. Lufthansa Group reported operating profit of around €2.7 billion ($2.9 billion) — the third-biggest in its history, and up 76% from 2022.The warning of more losses came on the same day as thousands of the airline’s ground staff staged fresh strikes, forcing flights to be canceled. Their action was timed to coincide with a walkout by security staff that closed Frankfurt airport — one of the world’s busiest hubs for international air travel.The industrial action “will cause major disruptions and flight cancellations throughout the day, (and) security checkpoints will remain closed,” the airport said in a statement on its Facebook page Wednesday.Security staff at Hamburg and Dusseldorf airports have also walked off the job.The Verdi union, which represents 25,000 Lufthansa ground staff, had called for them to go on strike from early Thursday and until Saturday morning. The union, which is pushing for a 12.5% pay rise or at least €500 ($545) more a month for the workers, said the latest round of negotiations with Lufthansa had fallen through.The company said Wednesday that between 80% and 90% of its flights could be disrupted Thursday and Friday, impacting more than 200,000 passengers.Marvin Reschinsky, a negotiator for Verdi, said Monday that it was “impossible” to believe that Lufthansa could be so financially successful while “employees on the ground, with hourly wages of sometimes €13 ($14), no longer even know how they are able to make ends meet in the most expensive cities in Germany.”That financial success means the airline group will pay shareholders a dividend for the first time since 2019, it said in its results announcement Thursday.Michael Niggemann, Lufthansa’s head of human resources, said Monday that the company was prepared to negotiate with Verdi at short notice, and that it had already made an offer in response to the union’s demands.“The economic damage is already enormous, and all customers suffer from these strikes,” he added at Thursday’s press conference.The strikes are just the latest in a wave of industrial action in Germany, famed for its strong legal protections for workers, and follow walkouts by train drivers in January over wages.Resulting travel chaos this year has compounded the gloomy outlook for Europe’s largest economy, which shrank in 2023 for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, as it grappled with high energy prices and weak demand for its goods at home and abroad.The International Monetary Fund predicts Germany will be the slowest-growing major economy this year, eking out an expansion of just 0.5%.GDL, the German trade union representing rail workers, also said its members were going on strike Thursday and Friday. Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s state-owned rail operator, said it expected the industrial action to have a “massive” impact on its operations.Chris Stern in Berlin and Olesya Dmitracova, Eve Brennan and Rob North in London contributed reporting."

        "title": "Fatal Houthi rebel attack may be a ‘red line’ in Red Sea shipping crisis",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The first fatal attack on a commercial vessel in the Red Sea since Iran-backed Houthi rebels began targeting ships late last year has laid bare the enormous challenge of restoring safe passage along one of the world’s most important trade routes.At least three crew members were killed and four others injured in the assault Wednesday on the M/V True Confidence, a Liberian-owned bulk carrier, one of the ships that transport dry cargo such as grain and iron ore.The deadly strike marks a significant escalation of the Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea and and comes despite a US-led naval coalition to protect the crucial waterway. It also follows an assault late last month that sank a cargo ship, which is now discharging fertilizer into the ocean.Fewer ships appear to be transiting through the Red Sea and adjoining Suez Canal after the latest attack, according to maritime risks analytics company Windward. Transits have already dropped substantially since December when carriers started avoiding the area and rerouting vessels around the southern tip of Africa.Windward said the number of bulk carriers anchoring outside ports to the north and south of the Suez Canal surged 225% Wednesday compared with the previous day. “Our data shows that 61% of these (anchored) after 13:30 UTC (18:30 ET), which was the time of the attack,” Windward CEO Ami Daniel told CNN.He expects the attack will lead to even larger numbers of bulk carriers avoiding the Canal, through which 10-15% of world trade and 30% of container trade passes. “The propensity that something will happen is higher than people thought and the severity of the impact, once something happens, is (worse) than people thought,” he added.Windward data shows that last month the number of bulk carriers in the Red Sea was already at its lowest level in two years.The Houthis have launched more than 45 missile and drone attacks against commercial as well as US and allied naval vessels operating in the Red Sea, according to US and other Western officials.Most of these have been intercepted or have landed harmlessly in the water, making Wednesday’s attack even more of a shock, which could cause shipping companies still transiting the waterway to think again.“A red line may now have been crossed with the casualties,” said Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta, a shipping analytics company based in Norway.Just 30% of the usual shipping capacity — including container ships, bulk carriers, car carriers, and tankers carrying oil and liquefied natural gas — is still passing through the Red Sea and Suez Canal, according to Sand.“I am expecting that the deadly attack will see that level sink to a new low,” he told CNN. “It’s mainly oil tankers that are still transiting and (they are) those that we should now expect to retreat too in greater numbers.”At the very least, the assault makes clear that it could be many months before the crisis is resolved.That means major container shipping companies — including Maersk, MSC and Hapag Lloyd — will continue sending their vessels on the much longer, costlier route around Africa, keeping costs to transport goods elevated.Container shipping costs along some of the world’s busiest trade routes remain more than double what they were in December, according to data from London-based shipping consultancy Drewry.French container shipping firm CMA CGM said last week that it would resume “some transit” through the Red Sea “on a case-by-case basis.” The company did not respond to a CNN query on whether it plans to change its approach following the deadly attack.On Wednesday, the International Transport Workers’ Federation renewed its call on the shipping industry to divert ships around the Cape of Good Hope until safe transit through the Red Sea can be guaranteed.“We have consistently warned the international community and the maritime industry about the escalating risks faced by seafarers in the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea,” the organization’s secretary-general, Stephen Cotton, said in a statement.It could become more difficult to hire seafarers following the attack, Cotton told CNN, even as basic pay for many of those working in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to its southeast has already doubled following recent bargaining agreements.David Ashmore, an employment lawyer at global law firm Reed Smith, echoed this view. “In a world grappling with a shortage of maritime workforce, these safety concerns add another layer of complexity to an already challenging task,” he said.The incident “demonstrates what we’ve been saying since the start of the crisis, which is that the biggest impact is on seafarers,” added John Stawpert, senior manager for the environment and trade at the International Chamber of Shipping.“They’re in the front line… We always felt it would only be a matter of time before the Houthis’ attacks reach this conclusion.”"

        "title": "Liberal California mayors are backing this ballot measure that could lock up repeat retail thieves",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "For the first time in ten years, California voters could get the opportunity to change a controversial law aimed at criminal justice reform.A new proposal, called The Homelessness, Drug Addiction and Theft Reduction Act, would roll back parts of Proposition 47, approved by California voters in 2014 to reduce overcrowding in jails by reducing punishments for some crimes, like theft and drug possession.Many of the proposal’s backers are exactly who you’d expect: district attorneys, Republican lawmakers and big chain stores that have been lashing out against a Covid-era rise in shoplifting that last year subsided. But it has support from a handful of Democratic mayors, too.Although Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom opposes the proposal, arguing the system is sufficiently tough on crime. But it appears destined to be decided by voters: The proposal needs fewer than 547,000 signatures to get on California’s ballot in November, and organizers tell CNN they have 75% of the signatures needed.Currently under Prop 47, if someone steals less than $950 in merchandise, in most cases they will be charged with a misdemeanor. It’s a leniency compared to many other jurisdictions that some argue has led to skyrocketing theft in recent years. From 2019 to 2022, San Francisco saw an increase in shoplifting by 24%, according to the Public Policy Institute of California, which used data from the state’s Department of Justice to examine the problem.The situation was so dire last year at one Walgreens store in San Francisco, employees resorted to padlocking frozen foods.Under the new proposal, “an offender with two prior convictions for theft can be charged with a felony, regardless of the value of the stolen property.” It would also allow prosecutors to add together the value of property stolen across multiple thefts to exceed the $950 threshold for a felony charge, and create harsher punishments for organized retail theft rings.The proposal has garnered predictable support from big retailers.Walmart, which has 144 Supercenters and more than 100,000 employees in the state, is the top funder of the ballot initiative. It dontated $2.5 million to the committee sponsoring the measure.“The Homeless, Drug Addiction, Retail Theft Reduction Act is a balanced community safety approach with effective tools to allow judges to use their discretion to hold individuals accountable for repeated retail theft offenses,” Walmart said in a statement. “We believe these tools are what is needed to help communities enforce the law and improve safety for all.”Similarly, Walgreens expressed its support of the proposal in a statement to CNN.“Walgreens has taken a number of steps to address safety in our stores,” the company said. “Walgreens also supports the various external efforts of policymakers and advocacy groups, including proposed ballot measures, legislation and funding that will help foster a safer environment in the communities we serve.”Target, which donated $500,000 in support of the measure, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.But on a broad scale, the numbers don’t necessarily support retailers’ outcry on this issue. The National Retail Federation, a lobbying organization that represents big retailers, reported that shrink – losses due to external and internal theft, damaged products, inventory mismanagement and other errors — has remained about the same, between 1 and 1.5% of sales, since 2016. Target on Tuesday reported shrink declined in the fourth quarter.So why the outcry? Some analysts say it’s because it’s a useful deflection from other issues retailers face, like inflation, the shift to online shopping and over-expansion of brick-and-mortar retail, and their own mismanagement of inventory. And it forces lawmakers to respond.In 2022, Marlene Harden’s teen daughter was killed by fentanyl poisoning. Harden said 18-year-old Chloe got what she thought was a Percocet from a dealer on Snapchat. But the pill was laced with fentanyl.“The toughest decision of my life … was to take her off life support,” Harden told CNN.Harden believes lax California criminal policies contributed to her daughter’s death and now she is speaking out in hopes of changing them.“Nothing is being done. They’re coming into the court through the court system getting a slap on the wrist and getting sent home. We want change and we want to help hold these drug dealers accountable for the murder that they’re selling our children,” said Harden.When Prop 47 was approved by California voters ten years ago, it turned most drug possession offenses from felonies to misdemeanors. And right now, non-prescription fentanyl is not listed on Prop 47 as a hard drug that can result in harsher punishments in certain cases.The new proposal would create harsher penalties for people who deal fentanyl and other hard drugs.It would also “warn convicted hard drug dealers and manufacturers that they can be charged with murder if they continue to traffic in hard drugs and someone dies as a result,” and, “reinstate penalties for hard drug dealers whose trafficking kills or seriously injures a drug user,” according to the Act.In addition to harsher punishments for repeat offenders, the proposal would “create a new class of crime called a treatment-mandated felony.” Offenders could serve jail time for repeated hard drug related offenses if they refuse to participate in drug and mental health treatment.The effort to undo some aspects of Prop 47 comes amid a broader check on some other liberal crime enforcement policies in America. Oregon’s legislature, which also recently passed laws to reduce penalties for drug possession, reversed course last week and re-criminalized substances like fentanyl.Thanh Tran spent 10 years behind bars, with most of his time in state prison for attempted robbery and attempted murder.Tran said his biological mother has been unhoused and addicted to drugs for decades, so Tran spent most of his early life in foster care. During those turbulent years, he was in and out of juvenile hall and eventually joined a gang. At 18-years-old, he said he attempted to rob a drug house and was convicted of attempted robbery and attempted murder.Now a policy consultant for the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, Tran believes fixing the root of the problem is the only way to freedom.“When I was incarcerated, I saw a lot of people coming in and out and more often than not, they’re coming in and out because of mental health issues and poverty. And all of these issues we don’t necessarily want to address. It’s easier to say this is a criminal problem.”Lenore Anderson, a co-author of Prop 47, stood by the law as it stands.“Stringency of penalties is not going to be the way we get ourselves out of this,” she said. “What works better for accountability is not the severity of the sentence, it’s the likelihood of getting caught.”Anderson said lawmakers should require law enforcement to share data – like arrest records and bench warrants – in real time, so officers can make quick arrests out of repeat offenders.And, she said, lawmakers should update procedures in courtrooms that process misdemeanors to eliminate delays in the state’s treatment (or punishment). “It’s important that we go for swift and certain as opposed to bureaucratic and lengthy.”She also suggested that lawmakers take alternatives to incarceration – like addiction treatment, sober housing options, and other diversion programs – more seriously. “When we start to rebalance our justice system, and back away from the one-size-fits-all prison approach, it means that we need to get more forward thinking with the systems we use to hold people accountable.”Dozens of Republican and non-partisan lawmakers across the state, in addition to numerous District Attorneys, have signed on in support.“This initiative is a balanced approach, that will fix [Prop] 47, that will reduce crime, that will help people that are on the street actually go through a rehabilitation program, that will actually allow them to get back on their feet,” said Republican Mayor Richard Bailey of Coronado, a city in San Diego County. “And that’s why you’re seeing so many mayors from across the political spectrum with very diverse backgrounds coming out in support of this initiative.”The proposal has another unlikely champion: San Francisco Mayor London Breed. She is one of three Democratic mayors supporting the proposal.When asked by CNN why she was breaking from the Democratic party on the issue, Mayor Breed responded, “This is not a party issue. I don’t see this as a partisan issue. This is about keeping people safe.”It comes as she faces a tough re-election campaign – and a city full of voters frustrated with crime and blight. A recent San Francisco Chronicle poll found that just 28% of likely voters approve of Breed’s performance, even though crime in San Francisco is down in recent years.Police data shows that larceny theft, which includes retail theft and car break-ins, is down 37% from this time last year. “[Residents] want us to hold people, especially people who are violent criminals, accountable. They want to make sure that their communities aren’t destroyed by just what’s happening around the violence related to some of the crimes or fentanyl or anything of that nature,” Breed said.On Tuesday, San Francisco voters approved two ballot measures spearheaded by Breed. Prop E allows SFPD to deploy new technologies, including surveillance cameras and drones, and, loosens restrictions around vehicle chases. Prop F allows the city to require welfare recipients to undergo drug screenings, and to withhold public funds from those who decline treatment.Violent crime in San Francisco is down in recent years. But some crimes like robbery are up more than 20% since 2021, according to police data. “[Residents] want us to hold people, especially people who are violent criminals, accountable. They want to make sure that their communities aren’t destroyed by just what’s happening around the violence related to some of the crimes or fentanyl or anything of that nature.”Miracle also asked Breed if, “the rest of the country is going to see this and think maybe liberal policies don’t entirely work?”“I don’t think it’s fair to say that liberal policies don’t work. We’re not abandoning San Francisco values of second chances and compassion and support and help those things will continue in addition to the accountability piece,” Breed responded.California Governor Gavin Newsom recently criticized calls to change Prop 47 when he argued, “…the nature of retail theft has changed… it has become deeply organized and that’s what we need to go after.”He also reminded reporters that California’s $950 threshold for prosecuting retail theft as a felony is one of the toughest in the nation. Some red states like Texas and South Carolina require theft of at least $2,500 and $2,000 worth of items, respectively, to charge someone with a felony.Last September, the state announced it would be sending $267 million to law enforcement agencies throughout the state to tackle organized retail theft.In January, Newsom also called upon the state legislature to allow law enforcement to combine the value of multiple thefts to exceed the $950 threshold – just like the change called for in The Homelessness, Drug Addiction and Theft Reduction Act.He’s also calling for additional penalties for thieves who sell or intend to resell stolen items.The problem may have different solutions – and could be in the hands of California voters this fall."

        "title": "Opinion: The drama around Sam Altman is an urgent warning",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the ouster of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to resign. Altman has already moved on to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its third CEO in as many days.It’s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company’s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions – governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies – reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators?OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence “to benefit humanity as a whole.” But that sensibility hasn’t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it – but they also won’t tell reporters or the public exactly what it is.This dynamic – a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors – is partly to blame for Altman’s firing. The OpenAI board, according to CNN’s David Goldman, worried that “the company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.” At particular issue seemed to be Altman’s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried.But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company’s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he’ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy – without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives.AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to suggest the design to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers acutely understand just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper’s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and “gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force” in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans, according to reporting in the New Yorker.But don’t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, “no gas mask is helping anyone.” (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI’s risks – at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils – the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology is worth a read).AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of “it may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier” but in the sense of “it could break down human societies and kill us all.”Given the life-altering potential of AI – that even if it doesn’t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed – we all have a stake in how it’s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be largely men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve – and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit.Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs?One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential – except likely more difficult to regulate and control.“Regulation” does not begin to scratch the surface of what’s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step.So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity – our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety.The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?"

        "text": "Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg.Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17.That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm’s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company.Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman’s firing, is also joining Microsoft.Altman’s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive.Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the “Magnificent Seven” that have powered the lion’s share of the market’s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street’s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, reiterated his $425 price target for Microsoft’s stock following Altman’s and Brockman’s hires.“We view Microsoft now even in a stronger position from an AI perspective with Altman and Brockman” at the company, Ives wrote in a note on Monday.Other members of the “Magnificent Seven” saw a boost on Monday. Nvidia shares gained 2.3% to end the trading session at $504.20 ahead of its earnings due on Tuesday, notching a record-high close for the chipmaker."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Shares of New York Community Bank (NYCB) fell 23% Monday, hitting their lowest level since 1996.The stock is struggling to recover after the beleaguered regional lender said in a filing last week it had identified “material weakness” in the company’s controls. The issues caused a $2.4 billion loss to shareholders last quarter, NYCB said.Shares of NYCB slid more than 25% on Friday, a day after the company disclosed the new developments, including a major leadership shakeup resulting in Alessandro DiNello, its recently appointed executive chairman, becoming the new president and CEO.The stock was further pressured Friday evening after Fitch Ratings downgraded the quality of NYCB’s debt to junk status and Moody’s Investors Service lowered its rating further into junk territory.Last week, the Long Island-based bank announced it delayed the release of its required annual financial disclosure, known as a 10-K, to focus on addressing the issues it identified. The bank said it now expects to file its 10-K by March 15. Unless the company provides an additional update, the 10-K will be the latest source of information on whether depositors are withdrawing their funds. The delay draws eerie parallels to First Republic Bank, which postponed reporting its quarterly earnings shortly before it failed last year.The bank’s latest troubles come just one month after NYCB reported it would slash dividends after reporting a surprise loss of $252 million last quarter, compared to a $172 million profit in the fourth quarter of 2022. That caused the stock to plunge, bringing it to its lowest level since 1997.Amid the selloff, the company sought to reassure depositors and investors by notifying them that deposits were stable and had even increased slightly in the last quarter of 2023.Last week’s updates invite new questions regarding the strength of the bank. The problems management identified had to do with “internal loan review, resulting from ineffective oversight, risk assessment and monitoring activities.”Such language mirrors post-mortem reports of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — both failed a year ago.Year to date, shares of NYCB are down over 70%.NYCB’s troubles are having a mixed effect on other regional bank stocks.Shares of Valley National Bank (VLY) closed 5.6% lower on Monday, while Zions Bancorporation (ZION) closed 1% higher. The KBW Regional Banking Index closed 0.7% lower for the day."

        "title": "What ‘Super Tuesday’ means for your portfolio",

        "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.US investors have a lot to sweat this year: still-too-high inflation, a lack of clarity about when rates will come down to earth, tense foreign relations, and now, a presidential election season that is officially in full swing.Welcome to “Super Tuesday.” Today, a whopping 16 states and territories hold primary elections. And, as campaigning heats up, so too do investors’ worries: About one-third of Americans believe their investment strategy could change depending on who the next president is, according to recent research from Edward Jones.But stock market analysts say not to fret and to hold tight. They think markets are ultimately more powerful than politics.Markets over politics: This election cycle, polling and early primaries make Donald Trump and President Joe Biden the frontrunners in the 2024 race. Markets like certainty, and because both candidates have already been president, there’s some relief about the familiarity and knowledge of what to expect, said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.Although there are large divergences between the major candidates’ views on the economy, politics and policies often influence the market less than other factors. For example, Covid decimated a tax-break-induced market run during Trump’s administration. Markets loved Biden’s stimulus plan in his first year, but the Federal Reserve’s hyper-aggressive rate hikes in response to inflation sent stocks tumbling in 2022, only to rebound in 2023 and this year in anticipation of rate cuts.Also, promises made by candidates are not always promises kept.“What sounds promising during election campaigns often may not work in reality, so don’t put stock (literally or figuratively) into those claims,” Kourkafas said. “Market forces are more influential than political forces over the long term.”The stock market has increased under every political combination in Washington, and the economy has grown regardless of which party controlled the White House and Congress, Edward Jones found.That’s part of what analysts at Raymond James call the perception gap, where political polarization can distort economic views.An example: “The annualized return for the S&P [500] was almost identical in the Trump administration and the Obama administration, despite antithetical policies and beliefs,” said Simon Hamilton, a financial adviser at Raymond James.Based on annualized returns for the S&P 500, stocks gained an average 13.75% during Trump’s presidency. President Barack Obama saw a 13.84% return over both of his terms.Political talk can also paint a bleaker economic picture than the data suggests: More than 48% of Americans say they believe the economy remains in a downturn, according to a recent CNN poll. But, in reality, incomes are up, the economy is growing and consumer sentiment is near recent highs. While 49% of Democrats said they believe the economy is recovering, just 6% of Republicans said the same thing, according to the poll.“Because there’s so much political discord and polarization, even though a Republican may still be spending plenty, their perception of the economy is negative,” said Hamilton.Investors are reminded every four years that “markets are, at the end of the day, guided by the broader path of the economy, earnings and interest rates, not politics,” said Kourkafas. “That’s not to downplay the importance of the democratic process. But we have a long history of market data that support this view.”How to ride the wave: There may be some knee-jerk market reactions to political developments, especially as we get closer to November, said Kourkafas, but it’s “crucial to tune out the noise.”The success and resiliency of the markets don’t change with each election, “and neither should your investment strategy,” he said.While election outcomes are incredibly important to the fabric of the United States, companies and markets “tend to anticipate and adjust rather than reacting solely to policy changes,” said Hamilton.Election year math: History shows that stocks typically gain during the fourth year of presidential terms.The S&P 500 index has added 5% in the eight weeks following Election Day through the end of the year in the median election year since 1984, compared to a 2.6% gain during the same period during non-election years, according to Goldman Sachs.Still, stocks could see a milder rally this year. The S&P 500 has gained 6.2% on average during the fourth year of presidential terms since 1932, according to Yardeni Research. That’s below the 13.5% gain the index has averaged during the third year of presidential terms since 1931.Cocktail party fodder: While markets tend to advance during election years, they do better when Congress is out of session entirely.More than 90% of the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average between 1897 and 2004 took place on days when Congress was out of session, according to a study by economists at the University of Cincinnati and University of Missouri.Bitcoin surged to its all-time high on Monday, shaking off a more than two-year rut that put the future of the entire crypto ecosystem in question, reports my colleague Allison Morrow.Bitcoin, the world’s first and by-far largest digital currency, was trading at $68,791, topping the previous record of $68,789 reached on November 10, 2021.Over the past several months, bitcoin’s rally has been turbocharged by US regulators’ approval of exchange-traded funds pegged to the digital asset, which created an on-ramp for more traditional investors to incorporate bitcoin into their portfolios.That approval took years of lobbying by crypto firms, and was granted only grudgingly by the Securities and Exchange Commission after a court ruled the regulator’s reasons for rejecting bitcoin ETF applications were “arbitrary and capricious.”The first 11 “spot” bitcoin ETFs — which track the real-time market price of the asset — launched in January.After just a month, the ETFs had spurred more than $4.2 billion in net new flows, according to Bloomberg.China has set an ambitious economic growth target of “around 5%“ for 2024, as its leaders vowed to “transform the growth model” in the face of growing challenges, reports my colleague Simone McCarthy.The figure — similar to last year’s growth target — was announced by Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday at the opening of the annual gathering of the National People’s Congress (NPC), the country’s rubber-stamp legislature, which draws nearly 3,000 delegates to Beijing for a week-long meeting.Officials are seeking to boost confidence in China’s economy, while grappling with how to stabilize the property sector, counter deflationary pressures, reverse a foreign capital exodus and save a battered stock market.Li’s speech did not contain any major new stimulus measures, leaving investors unimpressed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed down 2.6%."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "ASML has been ordered by the Dutch government to restrict shipment of some of its chip-making equipment to China, the company said on Monday.The curb comes after the United States ramped up its own restrictions on the types of semiconductors that American companies will be able to sell to China and also pressed its allies to enact their own.ASML, a maker of semiconductor production equipment based in the town of Veldhoven in the Netherlands, said in a statement that its “license for the shipment of NXT:2050i and NXT:2100i lithography systems in 2023 has recently been partially revoked by the Dutch government,” and the decision would impact “a small number of customers in China.”ASML is known for its prowess in making lithography machines, which use light to print patterns on silicon. That step is crucial in the mass production of microchips, which power everything from phones to washing machines.Because of its dominance in the market, ASML has been cited by experts as a bellwether of the growing rift between China and the West over access to advanced technology.For several years, the Dutch government has faced pressure from the United States to limit chip-related exports to China.In October, the Biden administration unveiled new rules that further expand on a sweeping set of export controls first introduced in 2022. ASML said when the rules were updated that due to “the length and complexity of the regulations, ASML will need to carefully assess any potential implications.”The updated export restrictions would affect between 10% and 15% of the firm’s sales to China, ASML Chief Executive Peter Wennink said during an earnings call in October.In its statement on Monday, the company said after discussions with the US government, it has “has obtained further clarification of the scope and impact of the US export control regulations.”But it does not “expect the current revocation of our export license or the latest US export control restrictions to have a material impact on our financial outlook for 2023,” ASML added.China reacted on Tuesday, by calling the US curbs “hegemonic” and “bullying.”These actions will “undermine the global semiconductor landscape,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said. “It will only backfire against the US.”He also urged the Netherlands to “protect the common interests of businesses from both countries with concrete action,” and ensure a “non-discriminatory business environment.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Harvard University turned over another trove of documents about campus antisemitism to Congress on Monday evening in response to an unprecedented subpoena from the House Education and Workforce Committee.Harvard was facing a 5 pm ET Monday deadline to respond to the subpoena, the first issued since the House Education Committee was founded in March 1867.It’s not clear whether the latest round of documents will satisfy Rep. Virginia Foxx, the Republican chairwoman of the committee who has accused Harvard of “obstructing” her investigation into campus antisemitism.“Harvard has produced documents in response to the Committee’s subpoena,” Nick Barley, a spokesperson for the House Education Committee, told CNN on Monday evening. “The Committee is currently reviewing those documents.”If Harvard had not responded, the committee would have had to consider further steps to enforce its subpoena.Harvard confirmed to CNN it submitted additional documents to Congress on Monday.University spokesperson Jason Newton said Harvard continues to respond “in good faith” to the committee’s inquiry, adding that it has now provided nearly 4,900 pages of information through 11 rounds of document submissions since January.That response, according to Newton, includes “non-public information and internal communications” that the committee has requested.“Harvard denounced antisemitism on our campus and have made clear that the University will continue to take actions to combat antisemitism in any form,” Newton said. “This includes ongoing efforts to engage with and learn from students, faculty and staff to identify the causes of antisemitic behaviors and address them when they occur on our campus.”Harvard previously indicated it would cooperate with the investigation, though the university did not say whether it would try to fight the subpoenas in court. Harvard said its cooperation would include “protecting the legitimate privacy, safety and security concerns of our community.”Three different Harvard officials were subpoenaed on February 16: Alan Garber, Harvard’s interim president; Penny Pritzker, the billionaire leader of the Harvard Corporation, the school’s governing board; and N.P. Narvekar, the CEO of the Harvard Management Company.The subpoena instructed Harvard to produce documents in 11 key areas that Foxx said would shed light on what steps the university is taking and previously took to keep Jewish students safe.Those requested documents include reports of antisemitic acts since early 2021, communications related to disciplinary action involving antisemitism, all documents and communications involving top Harvard officials relating to antisemitism and all meeting minutes since early 2021 of Harvard’s top boards.Harvard’s response to the House Education Committee on Monday included a four-page overview laying out steps the university has taken to combat antisemitism.Harvard told lawmakers it has increased campus security in “potentially vulnerable” spaces, including student residences, increased police presence and patrols at locations and events where the Jewish community gathers and periodically restricted access to Harvard Yard to “limit outside disruptions.”As CNN previously reported, Harvard told the House that officials have met with executives from anonymous social media app Sidechat following reports of a “disturbing rise in antisemitic posts.”Like other campuses, Harvard has been challenged by protests against the Israeli military action in Gaza. Harvard told lawmakers it will support the right to protest but not tolerate preventing students from exercising their right to learn, study, work and live. The university pointed to new guidance that emphasizes that “exercising the right to protest must not disrupt the University’s core work and campus life.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "While a mega merger between two of America’s largest grocery chains is snarled in regulatory red tape, a smaller European rival is eyeing a major expansion in the US.Aldi said Thursday that it plans to open 800 new stores nationwide in a $9 billion expansion plan, with the discount grocer announcing in a press release it wants to bring the “lowest possible prices during a time when consumers are more focused than ever on saving money.”The announcement from the chain, known for its low prices, comes as US shoppers are squeezed by higher food prices, with people cooking at home more as soaring prices make restaurant dining an unaffordable luxury for many.Specific locations for the new stores weren’t revealed, but the German company said it wants to strengthen its “already strong presence” in the Northeast and Midwest, plus expand out West in Southern California, Phoenix and new cities, like Las Vegas.Some of the 800 new locations will be store conversions from its now-complete acquisition of Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarkets, with a “significant number” of those locations — largely located in the Southeast — ditching their respective names and being remodeled into an Aldi.Approximately 50 stores will be converted later this year, with a majority of those reopening under the Aldi name in 2025. However, the Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarkets names won’t completely disappear: Aldi said that a “meaningful amount” of locations will retain that branding.Aldi’s expansion shows that it’s “throwing down the gauntlet to traditional grocery players,” according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail, adding that it’s a “major challenge to the market which could cause significant disruption and pain for other retailers.”Aldi has a low-cost business model and boasts that its prices are up to 50% cheaper than traditional supermarkets. At around 12,000 square feet, its stores are much smaller than a typical US supermarket of 40,000 square feet. More than 90% of the brands Aldi sells are its own private labels.Also, with shoppers still dealing with inflation and high prices at the grocery store, the announcement is “fortuitous” for consumers, Saunders said, because people are increasingly shopping around for better deals and seeking out value-oriented outlets, like Aldi.“Ultimately Aldi’s expansion is good news for US consumers. However, it will ramp up the competitive pressure in the grocery market,” Saunders said.The chain first opened its first US store in 1976, but in recent years has invested more than $5 billion to remodel existing stores and has opened hundreds of new ones.Aldi’s newest plan brings its store count to nearly 3,000 US locations, a notable expansion but still trailing against its rivals. If their merger is approved, Kroger and Albertson’s will have about 4,500 locations and Walmart, the nation’s largest grocer, has nearly 5,000."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "A group of former Twitter executives sued Elon Musk on Monday in a bid to recover more than $128 million in severance that they allege Musk has not paid since he acquired the company, now called X, more than a year ago.The executives include former Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, former CFO Ned Segal, former Chief Legal Officer Vijaya Gadde and former General Counsel Sean Edgett — all of whom were fired within hours after Musk took control of Twitter.The lawsuit alleges that Musk declined to make the severance payments as a form of “revenge” against the executives after he was forced to go through with the $44 billion acquisition deal, wh﻿ich he had spent months trying to get out of.“Because Musk decided he didn’t want to pay Plaintiffs’ severance benefits, he simply fired them without reason, then made up fake cause and appointed employees of his various companies to uphold his decision,” the complaint, filed Monday in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, states. “He claimed in his termination letters that each Plaintiff committed ‘gross negligence’ and ‘willful misconduct’ without citing a single fact in support of this claim.”X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Monday’s lawsuit is just the latest legal action brought by former Twitter employees related to Musk’s acquisition. One lawsuit brought by a former Twitter human resources leader in July, seeking class action status, seeks an order for Musk and the company to pay additional severance benefits allegedly owed to former employees in an amount no less than $500 million. The company has also been accused of failing to pay annual bonuses to employees laid off after Musk’s takeover.Agrawal, Gadde and Segal also previously sued Musk to recover more than $1 million in legal fees they said they were owed; the company was ordered to pay the fees in a Delaware Chancery Court ruling last year.Musk and X have also faced lawsuits from vendors, landlords and business partners who claim the company has failed to pay what they are owed.“Musk’s refusal to pay Plaintiffs is part of a larger pattern and practice of failing to comply with his payment obligations,” the former executives claimed in Monday’s lawsuit.A key focus of Monday’s lawsuit is an anecdote reported in the Musk biography published by journalist Walter Isaacson last year.The complaint cites the anecdote as evidence Musk intentionally sought to “cheat” the former executives out of what they were contractually owed, quoting the biography’s account of the moments leading up to Musk closing the Twitter acquisition in October of 2022.In the narrative, Musk reportedly claimed that closing the deal on Thursday, October 27 — a day before the scheduled close — and firing Agrawal and the other executives immediately would prevent them from resigning and claiming their severance benefits, saving the company an estimated $200 million.Closing the deal so quickly forced Agrawal to scramble to send his own letter of resignation, but it was too late, according to the account; Agrawal had already been fired and his access to email revoked.Musk’s apparent gambit to head off the severance obligations violated federal labor laws, the lawsuit alleges, because the reasons Musk cited for firing Agrawal and others do not stand up to scrutiny.“’Cause’ under the severance plans is limited to extremely narrow circumstances, such as being convicted of a felony or committing ‘gross negligence’ or ‘willful misconduct,’” the lawsuit said. “’Cause’ is not ‘Board-approved business decisions that Musk dislikes’ from the time before he owned the company.”According to the complaint, Musk’s termination letters to some of the executives explained that the source of their misconduct was a failure to cooperate with a government or internal investigation of Twitter, but the letters did not substantiate those allegations.The former executives claim they spent months trying to obtain the severance payments from X prior to filing the lawsuit but allege that the company and its leaders “have withheld documents and taken other actions designed to inhibit Plaintiffs’ presentation of their claims.”In addition to the severance payments themselves, the lawsuit also seeks a court order forcing Musk to make interest payments on the allegedly unpaid amounts, as well as a penalty for Musk’s alleged failure to send the executives legally required plan documents associated with their benefits."

        "text": "Investment giant Fidelity believes the shares it holds of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, are worth 71.5% less than when Musk first purchased the social media company in October 2022, according to a new securities filing.The latest disclosure by a Fidelity mutual fund reflects a long-running trend that has steadily reduced X’s estimated value over the past year amid successive crises at the company, many of which have been driven by owner Elon Musk.According to the new filing by Fidelity’s Blue Chip Growth Fund dated Dec. 30 and reporting information through Nov. 30, Fidelity estimates the shares of X that it owns are worth just under $5.6 million. The filing said its shares in X represent less than .01% of the total value of the fund, which it said is more than $49 billion.That’s a sharp drop from the $19.66 million the Fidelity fund said its stake was worth around the time that Musk was finalizing his acquisition of Twitter, and 14.5% less than the $6.55 million the fund said its shares were worth last April.Fidelity’s latest filing was earlier reported by Axios.Fidelity did slightly increase its estimated value of X multiple times last summer, around when Linda Yaccarino became X’s CEO. Since then, however, Fidelity has continued to cut the estimated value of its X shares.With X being privately held, Fidelity’s estimates have emerged as a closely watched indicator of X’s health and a reflection of the attitudes of Musk’s own investors."

        "text": "“Dune: Part Two” raked in $82.5 million at the domestic box office on during its opening weekend, narrowly surpassing the opening weekend of the 2023 blockbuster film “Oppenheimer.”The two films came from different studios — “Dune: Part Two” is a Warner Bros. Pictures movie and shares the same parent company as CNN, while Universal Pictures distributed ‘Oppenheimer.’In updated box office receipts released Monday, “Dune: Part Two,” directed by Denis Villeneuve, surpassed the milestone set last summer by the historical epic that was catapulted to success in theaters amid the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon. Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, brought in $82.4 million in its opening weekend.“Denis Villeneuve and Christopher Nolan inhabit that rarefied air of marquee filmmakers and both ‘Dune: Part Two’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ inspired audiences to head out to the multiplex on their opening weekends to the tune of over $80M in domestic receipts,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, said.The film is a much-anticipated sequel to one of the most popular science fiction adaptions in recent years, and helped revive a sleepy box office. Similarly, “Oppenheimer” was one half of the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon last summer, which took social media and the movie theater industry by storm.“This is just what the box office needed and much higher than any of us could predict,” said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. Pictures, which distributed the movie. “That’s especially true given that it’s a sci-fi movie, which is a genre that is a hard nut to crack. And we grossed $178.5 million worldwide, which is quite a standup.”The sequel doubled the domestic opening of the first “Dune” installment, which opened with $41 million when it was simultaneously released in theaters and on the streaming service HBO Max in October 2021. The film is also Villeneuve’s highest grossing movie.CNN’s Eva Rothenberg contributed to this report."

Last March, the media titan announced plans to marry Ann Lesley Smith, a former dental hygienist and conservative radio host. But the wedding was called off weeks later.This time, Murdoch will wed Elena Zhukova, a 67-year-old retired molecular biologist, according to The New York Times, which first reported the impending nuptials.Murdoch and Zhukova reportedly started dating in the summer and plan to marry at Moraga Bel Air, Murdoch’s luxury vineyard and estate in California.Images of the couple together have been published in recent months on news sites. Zhukova is the mother of Russian American art collector Dasha Zhukova, the former wife of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.Murdoch was recently listed as #280 on Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index, with a net worth of $9 billion.He stepped down as chairman of News Corporation, the print publishing arm of his media empire, last November, handing control of the business to his eldest son, Lachlan.At the time, Murdoch said he would continue an “active role” in the company, adopting the title of chairman emeritus of Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News and other broadcasting assets.Murdoch was previously married to former flight attendant Patricia Booker, journalist Anna Murdoch and entrepreneur Wendi Deng, who reportedly introduced him to Zhukova.He married his fourth wife, former model Jerry Hall, in 2016. Their divorce was finalized in August 2022.It’s unclear why Murdoch’s last engagement was called off.At the time, he said of the proposal to Smith: “I was very nervous … “I dreaded falling in love – but I knew this would be my last. It better be. I’m happy.”Murdoch’s office did not reply to a request for further information on the timing and location of his upcoming wedding."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.Reuss didn’t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. “We will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,” he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only.While Reuss’s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it’s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model.“Electrified” is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as “electrified.” It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car.Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla’s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production.Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn’t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though.To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels.Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari’s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "It was the year of artificial intelligence, and no Big Tech company leaned into the trend like Microsoft.In 2023, the company’s CEO Satya Nadella made a multi-billion dollar investment in AI, commercialized and added AI tools like ChatGPT into its suite of products before rivals, and stunned industry onlookers with his ability to handle a crisis quickly, calmly and thoughtfully.Under his leadership, the company is re-emerging as a tech innovator after years of riding the success of Windows. Wall Street has noticed, too: Microsoft’s stock is up 55% this year.That’s why CNN Business’ staff chose Nadella as the CEO of the Year, beating out other contenders including Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.“There’s no question 2023 was the year of AI,” Nadella told CNN in an emailed response. “We’re no longer just talking about innovation in the abstract; we’re seeing real product-making, deployment and productivity gains. At the end of the day, though, this innovation will only be useful if it’s empowering all of us in our careers, in our communities, in our countries.”Since 2018, the CNN Business’ team of writers and editors have met at the end of each year to select one person whose executive performance stood out. The process is admittedly subjective — we choose someone based on criteria that shifts year to year.Maybe the company’s stock outperformed its rivals. Maybe the CEO righted the ship after a messy product launch or the company developed a lifesaving vaccine that altered the course of human history (tip of that hat to 2021’s CEO of the Year, Pfizer’s Albert Bourla).This year’s CEO of the Year is once again a man, indicative of a larger representative problem in corporate America’s top positions. About 10% of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies are women, according to Fortune. But our aim has never been to endorse any one executive over another. Rather, we hold a mirror up to the business world and tell a story about what we see. (We also considered non-CEO leaders, and chose Taylor Swift as our business leader of the year.)For 2023, Nadella’s decisions have heavily impacted and influenced the direction of AI, the most significant innovation to come from Silicon Valley in decades.As Gil Luria, a senior research analyst at wealth management firm DA Davidson, puts it: “His ability to steer the aircraft carrier that is Microsoft into this new era has been nothing short of remarkable.”Nadella’s background doesn’t entirely fit the Ivy League dropout archetype of Silicon Valley. Born in India, Nadella came to the US in the late 1980s to pursue a master’s in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, later receiving an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Nadella’s standout performance is a culmination of his work from prior years. He joined the company in 1992 as an engineer, at a time Microsoft was characterized by regulators as a monopoly.When he was promoted to CEO nearly 10 years ago, Microsoft had developed a reputation for being slow to adapt to major trends, such as mobile. Fast forward to now and tech companies are lining up to partner with Microsoft and align with its mission to commercialize artificial intelligence for the masses.In Nadella’s 2017 book, “Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft’s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone,” he wrote about his experience reworking everything internally, team by team and product by product, so Microsoft would be better set up for employees to collaborate with others.He also worked to soften and revitalize Microsoft’s image. As far back as 2016, the company partnered with OpenAI — a then-emerging company with new AI tools — and allowed them to operate the technology on its Azure cloud servers in exchange for access to those tools.But after a massive $13 billion investment in OpenAI earlier this year, following the viral launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Microsoft rolled out AI-powered versions of its flagship products, such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, breathing new life into otherwise dulled software. Nadella’s push to commercialize these tools quickly gave it a head start against competitors such as Google and Amazon, who were working on similar technologies, and helped ignite an arms race across the industry.Now as more companies, from Instacart to Snapchat, add ChatGPT and other OpenAI technologies to their own services, Microsoft’s cloud business is poised for deeper growth. Microsoft has reported strong Azure growth over the last three quarters.While Nadella had an impressive year across the board, his leadership shined even brighter during the string of events that followed the surprising ousting of OpenAI’s Altman, the Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving week.The timing was noteworthy too: Just four days before, Nadella joined Altman on stage at OpenAI’s first developer conference to discuss the future of artificial intelligence and their partnership together.The executives represented one of the most dynamic and key relationships in the tech industry, not only of the year but in years: Altman had clearly emerged as the face of the generative AI movement, and Nadella was one of the most powerful tech leaders funding the development of these tools.“You guys have built something magical,” said Nadella at the time. “It’s been fantastic for us.”But despite his long-standing relationship with OpenAI, Nadella reportedly found out about Altman’s removal from the company “just before” OpenAI released a statement, rendering Microsoft with no control over the situation.The company in a statement said an internal investigation found that Altman was not always truthful with the board.Microsoft’s stock sank in response, perhaps because OpenAI was to serve as a linchpin to their plans to expand AI across its products. “It was not a good look for Microsoft,” Luria said.Nadella swiftly picked up the phone and offered to hire Altman at Microsoft to lead a new AI research lab, along with one of the co-founders, Greg Brockman, and any of the 700 Open AI employees who wanted to leave the company.He also spoke to some OpenAI board members — the people who initially kept him out of the loop — and was able to get them on board with a solution that would be favorable to Microsoft, according to Luria.Altman ultimately returned to OpenAI, with a new board intact.“He turned what looked like a bad and embarrassing situation into a way to improve Microsoft’s standing with this very important partner,” Luria added. “What we saw from Mr. Nadella is an interpersonal skill you don’t always find with CEOs, who can be visionaries and luminaries and great at product, but aren’t necessarily able to pick up a phone, talk to people and get them to see things your way.”As Fred Havemeyer, a senior enterprise software analyst at the Macquarie financial services firm, said in a letter to investors, “Mr. Nadella may have pulled off his own coup, acquiring the most important part of OpenAI — its ambitious talent.”By Monday morning, Microsoft was in better shape than they were a week before. Its stock reached a record that day; shares rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44, beating the previous record of $376.17.According to Stuart Carlaw, chief research officer at ABI Research, Nadella’s successful year can be largely attributed to the fact that he’s remained extremely “focused.”“His approach to the mechanics of leadership remains people driven,” Carlaw said. “He understands that people drive outcomes, and remained true to that ethic in the way he dealt with Sam Altman and the wider OpenAI team.”Nadella also narrows in on where he wants to spend his energy. “He hasn’t been on a scattergun spree of investment ever since he took the reins,” Carlaw said. “He has been very focused on accretive areas that take the Microsoft brand forward.”Takeshi Numoto, Microsoft’s chief marketing officer who has been employed in various roles at the company for 25 years, said he felt an internal culture shift this year, saying the company feels “fresh” and “energizing.”“There is a sense that we are contributing to building the next wave of computing broadly for the world, and doing so thoughtfully,” he said.Nadella told CNN he indeed remains “focused” on empowering both people and organizations to achieve more, as it continues to make and deploy new products.“That’s our mission at Microsoft … and what we continue to focus on as we look to 2024 and beyond,” he said. “Just imagine if 8 billion people had access to a personalized tutor, a doctor that provided them medical guidance, a mentor that gave advice for anything they needed. I believe all that’s within reach. It’s about making the impossible possible.”The biggest challenge, however, is if Nadella can take Microsoft to the next level by making these AI-powered products profitable.“You are only as good as your last results release,” Carlaw said. “[But] he is not the only one facing this dilemma.”—CNN’s Allison Morrow contributed to this report."

        "title": "Forget ‘spend less’ or ‘save more.’ Make this your No. 1 financial resolution for 2024",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "You may think that improving your financial life is simply a matter of taking unpleasant but necessary steps: Curb spending. Cut debt. Make more. Boost savings.But, in real life, if your money resolutions for 2024 are just a long list of financial chores that you know you “should” have been doing but haven’t, you’re likely to ditch the plan by your third pot of coffee in January.Here’s why: When it comes to managing our money, regardless of our net worth, there is usually a persistent gap for most of us: We know what we should do, but we struggle to actually do it.“If you have the key fob to the gym, it doesn’t make you fit,” said Ashley Agnew, president of the Financial Therapy Association and director of relationship development at Centerpoint Advisors.It’s hard to get motivated to do anything when you’re just doing it because you think you “should.” When it comes to improving your finances, staying motivated is much easier when you’ve honestly assessed what makes you feel content and secure in life and then figured out how to use your money to foster those feelings.So make just one financial new year’s resolution for 2024: Figure out what financial well-being means for you. It will be a highly personal endeavor. Then pick one or two steps to improve it.Here are seven ways you might define it and improve upon it in the new year:Money helps mitigate uncertainty like emergencies, job loss, illness or premature death. Hence the desire for rainy day funds and insurance.How much you’ll need for either depends on your circumstance. To help figure out what is right for you, familiarize yourself with what your life today costs, so you know what baseline you’re working with, Agnew suggested.Beyond reviewing your monthly expenses (food, housing, utilities, health care, debt payments, subscriptions, etc.), map out when those and other anticipated expenses will arise. She recommends drawing a quadrant, and labeling each box with a season. In each season’s box, include your regular expenses plus special ones like birthdays, weddings and vacations, or scheduled expenditures like a roof replacement or tuition bill.Doing so will make it easier to see how much you’re really spending, what you can cut if need be and where you might be able to free up money to do something you’ve been avoiding but that might give you peace of mind. For instance, if you have young kids, you might make 2024 the year you buy a low-cost life insurance policy so you know you’ll be able to provide for your family when you’re gone.No one wants to think about their own death, but avoiding the issue just makes things harder on your family. “Avoidance will prevent you from taking a deep breath. You can avoid the action but you can’t bury something completely when it comes to money,” Agnew said.Beyond creating a greater sense of security, financial well-being is about using your money as you wish.So look at where your money goes. Does it reflect what you really want? Or do you spend some of it living up to the standards and expectations set by your parents or society? For example, maybe you got a bigger, more expensive home than you feel you need or you feel an unspoken pressure to buy more expensive brands. Or maybe you spend too much on your children in ways that aren’t really that meaningful to either of you, or which your adult children take for granted.“We live in a world of comparison. It can be difficult to live up to someone else’s financial standards,” Agnew said.Financial well-being is also about reallocating the money you have in ways that serve you better.“Sometimes it isn’t about adding more. It’s about subtracting. Sometimes it can be, ‘How can I spend my money to do less?’” said Meghaan Lurtz, learning and development specialist at Shaping Wealth, which trains financial professionals to help their clients achieve “funded contentment.”Lurtz is referring to the fact that time is everyone’s most limited resource. You can use money to buy a little time back if it lets you focus on what is most important to you.Take house chores and cooking. If they eat up most of your free time outside of work and take you away from being fully present with your young kids at key times of the day, you might consider spending money on a meal plan or hiring a house cleaner to help out once in a while.Financial well-being also results when you use your money to express your values in the world through charitable donations or providing a meaningful gift for someone in need — e.g., help with tuition or paying off a medical bill or student loan, etc. Or it can simply be having the capacity to volunteer your time.It’s not necessary to be a multi-millionaire in any of these regards. “People can be wealthy in that they live within their means and live within their values,” Lurtz said.Money is a tool that can free you from the distress of always having to choose between paying for groceries or paying the electric bill. But beyond allowing you to afford life’s basic necessities, it’s not a magic wand that can buy you deep-in-your-bones happiness.That’s worth remembering the next time you’re thinking about buying something that was marketed to evoke feelings of a beautiful home, a perfect family or a sense of being on top of the world. Ask yourself, “Is it the thing you want or the feeling from the thing you want?” Agnew said.Take time to envision what would make you feel more content in your life overall because ultimately money should serve you in achieving that vision.“What do you enjoy? What did you like doing as a kid that you don’t do now? Everyone has their own picture of contentment. Get in touch with what you want your picture to be,” Lurtz suggested.Be specific, she said. Envision what would be happening, where you are, how you are spending your time, who is with you and how you feel.Compare that vision with where you are today. Then come up with a couple of small, achievable goals to move you closer to that vision. For instance, if you used to love playing the piano or painting when you were younger, it might mean committing time to doing that and maybe even some money for lessons. Or if you miss spending time with old friends who live far away, it may mean setting aside some money to travel to see them.There are plenty of other ways to define financial well-being for yourself. And you can help keep your new year’s resolution by simply reading a book that helps you think differently about money and its role in your life.Among the ones Agnew and Lurtz like best are: Mind over Money by Brad Klontz; The Psychology of Money by Morgan Hounsel; and The Geometry of Wealth by Brian Portnoy.Ultimately, the goal is to figure out what role you want money to play in your life. “It only does what you tell it to do,” Agnew said."

        "title": "Deliberate toxic burn following Norfolk Southern derailment was not necessary, safety regulator testifies",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "A massive controlled burn that sent toxic chemicals into the air of East Palestine, Ohio, in February 2023 was not necessary, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board testified at a Senate hearing Wednesday.Under questioning from Sen. J.D. Vance, an Ohio Republican, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy agreed with the senator that evidence gathered since the incident showed the controlled burn of five railroad tank cars full of vinyl chloride was the wrong decision because the temperature in one tank car was coming down, the other four were all less than 70 degrees and there was no risk of explosion.On February 3, 2023 a Norfolk Southern freight train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, a small town near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border, sending more than a million pounds of hazardous chemicals into the soil, water and air.Residents were ordered to evacuate temporarily and while state and federal environmental officials say testing shows the air and water in the town is now safe, some residents still complain of health symptoms such as burning sensations in their eyes, tingling in their lips, heaviness in their chest and swelling of lymph nodes in their neck and groin.When the controlled burn of the toxic chemicals was executed, three days after the derailment, it was announced it was because there was an imminent risk of an uncontrolled explosion if the chemicals were not released and burned off. The officials on the ground who authorized the controlled burn were told they had only minutes to make the decision before an explosion.But Homendy said there was no scientific basis for the controlled burn. “There was another option: let it cool down,” she said. “It was cooling down.”Vance said the NTSB investigators’ findings, which he praised, were very troubling. He said East Palestine residents have said freight started moving on tracks through the town soon after the controlled burn allowed for the removal of the tank cars.“I won’t ask you to speak to motivation here, but when you have an unnecessary [controlled] burn that poisoned a lot of people, then led to rapid transit of train traffic, a lot of people, including me, are wondering, did they do this, not because it was necessary but because it allowed them to move traffic and freight more quickly,” Vance said to Homendy.“At the very least, it was poisoned for reasons that we can’t identify,” he said later in the hearing. “That should really concern every single person on this committee.”Homendy’s comments also brought harsh criticism from Ohio’s other senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown. Brown is not a member of the committee that heard the testimony and was not present Wednesday.“This is outrageous,” he said in a statement after the hearing. “The people of East Palestine are still living with the consequences of this toxic burn. This is more proof that Norfolk Southern put profits over safety and cannot be trusted.”Norfolk Southern, which did not have a representative testify at the hearing, issued its own statement Wednesday defending the decision to have a controlled burn.“The final decision to conduct a controlled release was made by the incident commander, with input from multiple stakeholders, including Norfolk Southern and local, state, and federal authorities,” said the railroad’s statement after the hearing.“The top priority of everyone involved was the safety of the community, as well as limiting the impact of the incident. The successful controlled release prevented a potentially catastrophic uncontrolled explosion that could have caused significant damage for the community,” it said.“To date, continuous environmental testing in coordination with and alongside US and Ohio EPA has shown the air and drinking water in the community are safe,” it added.But Homendy said in her testimony Wednesday that the people who were making the decision to execute a controlled burn were not aware that executives with Oxy Vinyls, the company whose chemicals were in the tank cars, were on the scene and telling Norfolk Southern and its contractor that there was no risk of an explosion.“When advice was given to the governor of Ohio, to the incident commander, they were not given full information because no one was told Oxy Vinyls was on scene,” Homendy testified. “They were left out of the room. The incident commander didn’t even know they existed. Neither did the governor. So they were provided incomplete information to make a decision [to have a controlled burn].”"

        "title": "Church of England urged to build a $1.3 billion fund to tackle its legacy of slavery",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The Church of England has welcomed a report that calls for it to spearhead the establishment of a £1 billion ($1.3 billion) fund to address its historical ties to slavery.The document, released Monday, recommends that the church’s initial commitment of £100 million ($127 million) to the “Fund for Healing, Repair and Justice” should form the nucleus of a bigger initiative that would target assets of over £1 billion.The Church Commissioners group, which manages the church’s £10.3 billion ($13 billion) investments, has accepted the report “in full,” the church said in a statement.The report was drafted by an independent “oversight group” comprising mainly Black experts from various fields, recruited to advise the Commissioners on the new fund.Established last year following revelations that the Church had profited from the South Sea Company, which was involved in the transatlantic slave trade, the fund will invest in Black-led businesses focusing on education, economic empowerment, health and improving Black people’s access to land and food.The report also calls for the Church Commissioners to build up the value of the fund by bringing in co-investors while also increasing its own allocation.The Church of England is the established church in the United Kingdom. Its most senior leader, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, is also the spiritual head of the worldwide Anglican church.“No amount of money can fully atone for or fully redress the centuries-long impact of African chattel enslavement, the effects of which are still felt around the world today,” said Barbados-born Bishop Rosemarie Mallett, who led the oversight group.“But implementing the recommendations will show the commitment of the Church Commissioners to supporting the process of healing, repair and justice for all of those across society impacted by the legacy of African chattel enslavement.”Britain enslaved 3.1 million Africans between 1640 and 1807, transporting them to colonies around the world, according to Historic England, a public body. Many of these people were taken to the Caribbean to work on sugar plantations, which made their owners very wealthy through the export of sugar, molasses and rum, according to the National Archives.“Crimes against humanity rooted in African chattel enslavement have caused damage so vast it will require patient effort spanning generations to address. But we can start today, in small and large ways,” Monday’s report said.It also urged the Church Commissioners to deliver the full sum committed to the fund sooner than over the nine years originally envisaged.“The oversight group’s independent work with the Church Commissioners is the beginning of a multi-generational response to the appalling evil of transatlantic chattel enslavement,” said Welby.In 2020, major British institutions, including the Bank of England and insurance market Lloyd’s of London, apologized for their historic ties to the transatlantic slave trade in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd in the United States.The movement saw companies around the world pledge to address racial injustice by, for instance, increasing ethnic minority hiring or donating to charitable organizations."

        "title": "Why lab-grown diamond sales are surging",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "It’s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales.Not that you’d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag.“The result is really stunning,” said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst.He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period.Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.“The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,” he said. Too late. “It’s actually happening.”Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.“This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.“A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.”This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds.The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world’s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output.Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious.Mined diamonds have a controversial history that’s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded “conflict diamonds” that fund conflict in war-torn areas.Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot.Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small.Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world’s largest jewelry company, Pandora (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.Pandora said it’s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it.Signet, (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts.Calling it a “fast-growing category” in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don’t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it.“As the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn’t surprising,” said Don O’Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. “[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they’re conflict-free. They’re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.”Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting.There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won’t get much for it.But the value of a ring isn’t just monetary.“As a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,” said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. “I always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Within a year of calling off his last wedding, nonagenarian billionaire Rupert Murdoch has popped the question to another partner, months after they started dating.The former News Corp chairman’s media representative confirmed the news to CNN on Friday, just days before the billionaire’s 93rd birthday next Monday.It’s the second time Murdoch has been engaged in a year. Last March, the media titan announced plans to marry Ann Lesley Smith, a former dental hygienist and conservative radio host. But the wedding was called off weeks later.This time, Murdoch will wed Elena Zhukova, a 67-year-old retired molecular biologist, according to The New York Times, which first reported the impending nuptials.Murdoch and Zhukova reportedly started dating in the summer and plan to marry at Moraga Bel Air, Murdoch’s luxury vineyard and estate in California.Images of the couple together have been published in recent months on news sites. Zhukova is the mother of Russian American art collector Dasha Zhukova, the former wife of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.Murdoch was recently listed as #280 on Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index, with a net worth of $9 billion.He stepped down as chairman of News Corporation, the print publishing arm of his media empire, last November, handing control of the business to his eldest son, Lachlan.At the time, Murdoch said he would continue an “active role” in the company, adopting the title of chairman emeritus of Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News and other broadcasting assets.Murdoch was previously married to former flight attendant Patricia Booker, journalist Anna Murdoch and entrepreneur Wendi Deng, who reportedly introduced him to Zhukova.He married his fourth wife, former model Jerry Hall, in 2016. Their divorce was finalized in August 2022.It’s unclear why Murdoch’s last engagement was called off.At the time, he said of the proposal to Smith: “I was very nervous … “I dreaded falling in love – but I knew this would be my last. It better be. I’m happy.”Murdoch’s office did not reply to a request for further information on the timing and location of his upcoming wedding."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "China registered a surprise jump in foreign trade at the start of the year, partly because of strong demand from Russia, India and emerging markets in Africa and Latin America.Exports from the world’s second largest economy rose by 7.1% in the January-to-February period, beating the 1.9% growth forecast by a Reuters poll of economists. The growth is also significantly higher than the 2.3% gains recorded in December.China typically reports economic data for the first two months of the year together to avoid any distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday.Imports also beat expectations, up 3.5% from a year ago, while the trade surplus reached $125.2 billion, about 7% higher than the same period last year.China’s economy is battling a number of headwinds, including weak consumer and investor confidence, high youth unemployment and a long-running real estate crisis. The turnaround in trade — a year ago it was shrinking — is a rare bright spot in a gloomy picture.Apart from the weak base effect, strong demand from emerging markets helped China’s trade surge at the start of the year. Shipments to Africa, Latin America, and India rose by 21%, 20.6%, and 12.8% respectively.“While the strong export growth to India may reflect more its strong domestic economy, exports to Africa and LatA﻿m could indicate growing trade ties between China and these emerging economies, amid a broad global geopolitical shift,” said Nomura analysts on Thursday.India is the world’s fastest growing major economy, and its government expects it to expand by 7.6% this year.Meanwhile, China’s exports to Russia increased 12.5%, representing a slowdown from the rapid growth seen last year. Moscow became China’s 10th-largest trading partner last year, with a record $240 billion worth of goods shipped between the two countries. At the start of 2024, it slipped to the 11th spot.“China’s exports to Russia are unlikely to surge again in the near term to levels on par with those in 2023, due mainly to a high base and limited space for Chinese exporters to further expand their market shares in Russia,” said Nomura analysts on Thursday.China’s shipments to the United States also increased, up 5% from a year earlier. But its exports to other traditional trading partners, such as the European Union, Japan, and Australia, registered declines.Analysts are cautious about the outlook of the trade sector.“At the current juncture, it is likely too soon to call for a revival in China’s trade sector,” said HSBC analysts on Thursday.“We hold the view that trade uncertainty is likely to persist as global growth may still [be] soft amid high interest rates.”Trade restrictions against China might also hamper growth later this year, said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING.In October, the European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicle imports into the bloc. The Biden administration has also been discussing raising tariffs on some Chinese goods, including EVs, the Wall Street Journal reported in December, citing anonymous sources.Wang Wentao, the country’s commerce minister, said Wednesday at a press conference that foreign trade might face a severe situation this year amid weak international demand and trade protectionist measures globally."

        "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.Nvidia isn’t the only stock capturing the attention of AI enthusiasts these days.Nvidia is undoubtedly the poster child for artificial intelligence. Shares of the American chipmaker have soared roughly 277% over the last 12 months, helping drive a powerful bull market that’s led stocks to record highs. Nvidia closed above a $2 trillion market cap on March 1, joining an elite cohort including Apple and Microsoft.But there’s another AI-related stock that has quietly logged eye-popping gains.Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) have surged about 296% so far in 2024, following a 246% jump in 2023. Supermicro’s stock gained even more momentum in January, after the company reported second-quarter results that blew past expectations and raised its full-year revenue forecast.Supermicro’s stock was one of the most popular names bought by Charles Schwab clients in February, according to the firm’s latest trading activity index.The server producer counts Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices among its customers. Its stock had risen at a breakneck pace even before last year’s bull market. The shares jumped roughly 87% in 2022, while other tech names and the broader market got pummeled as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively to bring down wayward inflation.Supermicro’s runaway gains are indicative of the burgeoning demand for high-quality infrastructure to support AI chips, after the creation of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 kickstarted a race among tech behemoths to develop generative AI platforms and tools.Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom. The chipmaker, which produces processors that power AI systems, reported last month that its full-year profits grew more than 580% from the prior year.“Everyone’s looking for something that looks and smells and tastes like Nvidia. … [Supermicro] is exactly that,” said Victoria Bills, chief investment strategist at Banrion Capital Management.Supermicro has a market cap of roughly $63 billion, up from $5 billion just a year ago. The stock is set to join the benchmark S&P 500 index at its next quarterly rebalance.Wall Street thinks it has more room to run. Bank of America analysts initiated coverage on Supermicro last month with a “buy” rating and price objective of $1,040, which the stock has already surpassed, closing at $1,124.70 a share on Wednesday. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs analysts also recently initiated coverage.“The company’s willingness to experiment with different combination of components, its close proximity to leading semiconductor companies in San Jose and the fact that a majority of its manufacturing is in the United States is a competitive advantage,” wrote BofA analysts in a February 15 report.Beleaguered regional lender New York Community Bank is receiving a more than $1 billion equity investment, reports my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald.The majority of the investment, $450 million, is coming from former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s firm, Liberty Strategic Capital. The remaining sum will come from Hudson Bay Capital, Reverence Capital Partners, Citadel Global Equities and “other institutional investors and certain members of the Company’s management,” according to an announcement NYCB made Wednesday afternoon.The bank’s stock plunged more than 40% earlier on Wednesday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the bank was seeking a major cash infusion. After the deal was announced, the stock shot up 31% but those gains quickly leveled off. Ultimately, shares of NYCB closed 7% higher for the day after trades settled.The money “provides a lifeline,” David Chiaverini, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, told CNN.In addition to the investment, NYCB announced Joseph Otting, a former comptroller of the currency, will replace Alessandro DiNello as CEO. DiNello, who was named CEO less than a week ago, will now become non-executive chairman.Read more here.UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt announced a tax cut for workers Wednesday as he unveiled what is likely to be the government’s last budget before a general election later this year, reports my colleague Hanna Ziady.Hunt cut national insurance — a levy paid by people who work — by two percentage points. That means an additional £450 ($572) a year for the average employee or £350 for someone who is self-employed. It’s the second such cut in a matter of months.“If we want to encourage hard work, we should let people keep as much of their own money as possible,” Hunt said.But soaring UK government debt, crumbling public services and a lackluster economy left the chancellor with very little room for further substantial giveaways.The economy barely grew in 2023, slipping into recession at the end of the year in stark contrast with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s pledge to generate growth. In 2024, the Bank of England sees output expanding just 0.25%, while the International Monetary Fund has forecast growth of 0.6%.Hunt’s Conservative Party is trailing the opposition Labour Party by a wide margin in opinion polls, which had put him under enormous pressure to unveil tax cuts — however small — in a last-ditch bid to win voters.Read more here."

        "title": "The Rivian R2 and R3 are Rivian’s smaller, more affordable off-road EVs",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Rivian, the electric vehicle startup known for its of-road capable truck and SUV models, has unveiled two new, more affordable SUVs that the company hopes will take its sales to a new level.Currently, Rivian sells only two models, the big R1T SUV and the the R1S pickup, priced starting around $70,000 and $75,000, respectively. The new SUVs, called the R2 and R3, will be smaller and much less expensive.Prices for the R2 SUV, which will go on sale in early 2026, will start at around $45,000, Rivian said. At that price, it will still be relatively costly but it’s at least closer to an entry-level luxury vehicle, rather than at the high end.The R3 will cost even less than the R2, but Rivian didn’t provide any more specific pricing for that model. It will also be smaller, about 5 inches shorter, front to back, than the R2 and with a more sloped rear profile.The R2 is roughly the length of a Chevrolet Equinox, and neither the R2 and R3 will have a third row of seats. That’s something that set the larger R1S apart among electric SUVs, few of which can seat more than five.The new SUVs will be available in single-motor versions, which will have rear-wheel-drive. There will also be all-wheel-drive versions with either two or three motors. Three-motor versions will be able to accelerate from a stop to 60 miles an hour in under three seconds, according to Rivian. The R3 will be offered in a special high-performance model called the R3X.Although Rivian did not disclose specific performance numbers for the R3X, chief executive R.J. Scaringe described it as something like an off-road rally racing car.“It’s not a rock crawling vehicle, but it’s more of a a higher speed type of vehicle,” he said in an interview with CNN. “You do trails and exploring, but it’s a very high performance vehicle.”When purchased with larger optional battery packs, the R2 and R3 will be able to go over 300 miles on a full charge, according to Rivian. The SUVs will be able to fast-charge on either Tesla’s NACS chargers, or on the current industry standard CCS chargers. Like most other automakers, Rivian is planning to switch to the Tesla standard.In announcing the new vehicles, Scaringe also mentioned that plans for opening a second factory in Georgia, something the company had originally announced in 2021, were being postponed. He did not say how long those plans would be delayed, though.“The Georgia site still very much as part of our our strategy,” Scaringe said in an interview after new vehicles were unveiled.Rivian’s stock rose more than 13% Thursday. The stock had tumbled recently when the EV maker announced that 2024 sales wouldn’t be much higher than 2023 sales had been, at around 50,000 units. These new models, which won’t go on sale until at least the first half of 2026, won’t do anything to change that in the short term.And by moving into a lower price range, Rivian isn’t really avoiding competition, noted Sandeep Rao, an industry analyst with Leverage Shares, in an interview with CNN.Those in the middle and upper income segments of the US EV market are “spoiled for choices,” he said.“For $75,000 I can buy a Mercedes or a BMW, a 100-year-old Europe power house,” he said. “At 40,000, I can buy a Tesla.”Rivian will also face higher-end electric SUVs from Kia and Hyundai. But Rivian can set itself apart with vehicles that are actually capable of fairly serious off-road driving, something most electric SUVs don’t even pretend to be able to handle.But competition is coming, even on forest trails, as Volkswagen Group’s new Scout EV brand is almost directly aimed at Rivian’s customers. Scout, which recently started construction on a factory in South Carolina, expects to begin delivering its own off-road-capable electric truck and SUV models, priced close to the Rivian R2, in 2026, as well.Without naming Rivian, Scout chief executive Scott Keogh noted the advantage of Scout’s established brand name. “Scout” was the model name of an early SUV made by International Harvester, which was more typically known for heavy duty trucks and farm equipment.“Those who don’t know [the Scout name], when they do investigate it, that’s exactly what you want with a brand,” Keogh said in a recent CNN interview. “They say ‘Ah, look at the history! Look at the credibility, Look at the background,’ as opposed to a created name.”"

        "title": "First on CNN: First over-the-counter birth control pill in US ships to retailers, costing about $20 for one-month pack",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Opill, the first oral contraceptive approved for over-the-counter use in the United States, will be available in stores and online this month, with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $19.99 for a one-month supply and $49.99 for a three-month supply, according to Perrigo, the company behind the product.Perrigo announced Monday that Opill has shipped to major retailers and pharmacies and will be available to pre-order from select retailers beginning this week. Once the product hits shelves, anyone can buy it without a prescription. It will also be available at Opill.com.“From an online perspective, it should be available for order pretty much immediately,” said Triona Schmelter, executive vice president and president of consumer self-care Americas at Perrigo.As for the availability, “I expect it’s going to take a few weeks for it to get through the distribution pipeline, of us shipping to retailers’ distribution facilities and then them shipping to their stores,” she said. But once the product is on shelves, “consumers will find it in the family planning section in most retailers and should be able to pick it up at their convenience.”Opill will be available in stores and online as one-month and three-month packs, according to Perrigo. And at Opill.com, a six-month supply will be available at a price of $89.99.When taken as directed at the same time every day, Opill has been found to be 98% effective at preventing pregnancy, according to Perrigo. Most birth control pills are up to 99% effective at preventing pregnancy if taken as instructed every day.“We’re excited about this. It looks very good,” Patrick Lockwood-Taylor, president and chief executive officer of Perrigo, said of Opill’s rollout in a company earnings call last week. “The product is here, waiting to be distributed.”Walgreens and CVS have said they will offer the product.“Opill will be available at CVS.com and through the CVS Pharmacy app in late March,” spokesperson Matt Blanchette wrote in an email Friday. “In early April more than 7,500 CVS Pharmacy stores will offer Opill and for added privacy and convenience, customers will be able to choose same-day delivery or buy online and pick-up in store.”Some online retailers, such as the women’s health hub Stix, are poised to offer the product, as well. Stix founders Jamie Norwood and Cynthia Plotch said they are “excited” about the significant milestone that Opill marks for the accessibility of contraception but are “acutely aware” of the impact that cost may have on access.A survey conducted by the nonprofit KFF in 2022 found that among women who said they were likely to use over-the-counter birth control pills, 39% said they were willing and able to pay up to $10 per month for them, 34% would be willing and able to pay up to $20 per month – the recommended cost of a one-month pack of Opill – and only about 16% said they would pay more than $20. Under the Affordable Care Act, most insurance plans are required to offer coverage of birth control with no out-of-pocket cost, so it is free.“With these insights, Stix is committed to breaking down financial barriers, ensuring that essential health products and services are within reach for everyone,” Norwood and Plotch said.Plotch said Opill “is going to be really amazing for people who don’t otherwise have access to the prescription form of oral contraception that is covered by health insurance.”Last year, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Opill for over-the-counter availability, meaning it can be obtained without a prescription. Since then, questions have swirled around how much it would cost.A group of advocates called Free the Pill is among those urging a lower price. In January, Free the Pill sent a letter to Perrigo, calling on the company and retailers to price Opill at only $15 for a three-month supply.“We also urge Perrigo to implement a robust and accessible consumer assistance program for those who cannot afford to pay that price,” the letter said. “Perrigo’s and retailers’ decision to price Opill affordably can help to combat contraceptive inequities – rooted in systemic racism and other forms of oppression – that already persist across the United States.”Perrigo’s Schmelter said that advocacy groups like Free the Pill have been “essential in building the research, in educating the public, educating us, and being an advocate for bringing a birth control pill over the counter.”She added that Perrigo will have a cost assistance program available for qualified low-income and uninsured people, which will be available in the coming weeks.“We really wanted to think about all consumers as we were crafting our pricing strategy just to make sure that it was accessible to our consumers, and ensure both affordability and availability on shelf,” Schmelter said.For people with insurance, Opill may be eligible to be paid for or reimbursed through flexible spending or health savings accounts, according to Perrigo.Issues of cost and insurance coverage could still put Opill out of reach for some people, but overall, an over-the-counter birth control pill is a “great step forward,” said Dr. Colleen Denny, director of family planning at NYU Langone Hospital - Brooklyn, in an email.“Having an over-the-counter, highly effective birth control option on the shelves is potentially a great step forward in improving access to high quality birth control. We know that getting a prescription medication, which is required for all other birth control pills in the U.S., can potentially be a big barrier for patients,” she wrote. “A pill you could buy off the shelves could potentially help with that.”Opill works as a “mini-pill,” using only the hormone progestin to prevent pregnancy. Combination hormonal birth control pills, which contain both progestin and estrogen, increase the risk of blood clots more than progestin-only birth control pills, said Dr. Asima Ahmad, chief medical officer and co-founder of Carrot Fertility, a global fertility care platform.“Progestin-only pills do not increase the risk of having a blood clot like combined OCPs can, which can make it a great option for some people who cannot take combination OCPs,” Ahmad wrote in an email, referring to oral contraceptive pills.“The pill does need to be taken at the same time every day to be effective,” she said, “but if it is not taken consistently and around the same time every day, the effectiveness drops.”Because Opill is a progestin-only oral contraceptive, it is “incredibly safe” for the vast majority of people who may be interested in taking it, said Dr. Ashley Brant, director of complex family planning at Cleveland Clinic.Combined birth control pills may carry risks for people with uncontrolled hypertension or blood clot risks for smokers older than 35. Contraindications for progestin-only pills include conditions such as breast cancer or liver disease, or the use of certain medications.“Birth control pills are either progestin-only, or they’re estrogen plus progestin. For most people, either birth control pill will be safe, but the progestin-only pill in particular has very few contraindications to it. There are very few medical reasons why a progestin-only pill would be unsafe for someone,” Brant said, adding that overall, Opill is a “great step” toward making birth control more accessible.“Now, there will still be lots of people who prefer to come to their trusted health care professional, talk about other options, get a prescription, use their insurance to cover a prescription – and that way of getting birth control isn’t going to go away,” she said. “This is just one extra way to get birth control that we didn’t have before.”"

        "category": "health",
        "text": "Four decades after being diagnosed with a serious heart condition and given just six months to live, Bert Janssen has set a Guinness World Record as the longest-surviving transplant patient.“I want to be an example for people,” said the Dutchman, who was 17 when he was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, a heart muscle disease that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body.He says he is proof that living a long time with a heart transplant is possible.In 1984, the Netherlands had yet to perform its first heart transplant, so cardiologist Albert Mattart referred the teenager to Harefield Hospital in England.Janssen underwent transplant surgery in June that year after a heart became available following a tragic car crash in which two young adults died.The life-saving operation was carried out by transplant pioneer Magdi Yacoub.“I consider that day more important than my birthday,” said Janssen, who is now 57, married with two sons and a keen glider pilot.“I’ve never really looked this far ahead.”While he is fit and healthy, his heart medication causes side effects and in recent years he has had to slow down.“I still do more or less what I want (but) at a different pace,” he said.The average life expectancy for heart patients after a transplant is 16 years, according to Janssen’s current cardiologist, Casper Eurlings.Guinness World Records officially recognised Janssen’s achievement of living for 39 years and 100 days after receiving his transplant.The previous record was 34 years and 359 days, set by Canadian Harold Sokyrka in 2021, according to Guinness.Transplant patients “need to maintain a healthy lifestyle and be active. That’s what Mr. Janssen did,” Eurlings said.Yacoub has since thanked Janssen for his achievements and dedication to global health.“But it’s really me who should be thanking him,” Janssen said."

        "title": "Ahead of Oscars, maker of blockbuster weight loss drug urges against ‘vanity’ use in new ad campaign",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "“When I look around this room, I can’t help but wonder,” Academy Awards host Jimmy Kimmel joked at last year’s ceremony. “Is Ozempic right for me?”Celebrities’ use of a type 2 diabetes drug to lose weight had sparked both backlash and fascination by the time of last year’s Oscars. As this year’s ceremony approaches on Sunday night, the maker of a competitor set of medicines in Ozempic’s class has a message for people trying to use the drugs to slim down quickly for cosmetic reasons: These aren’t for you.“Some people have been using medicine never meant for them,” begins one ad from drugmaker Eli Lilly, called “Big Night,” which will debut on TV this weekend. “For the smaller dress or tux, for a big night, for vanity.”A red carpet is rolled out; paparazzi cameras flash.“But that’s not the point,” the voiceover continues as the images transition from a glitzy event to a woman dressed in ordinary clothes riding public transit. “People whose health is affected by obesity are the reason we work on these medications. It matters who gets them.”The ad doesn’t specifically mention Lilly’s drugs – Zepbound for obesity and Mounjaro for diabetes – and thus it doesn’t include the litany of safety information that US TV-watchers have become accustomed to at the end of pharmaceutical commercials.But it delivers a message Lilly’s been trying to convey since the beginning of this year.“We have a point of view about how these drugs are being used,” CEO David Ricks told CNN. “These medicines were invented for people with a serious health condition; they were not invented just to have someone who’s famous look a little bit better.”Zepbound and Mounjaro are part of a class of medicines broadly referred to as GLP-1 receptor agonists, which also includes Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and its sister drug, Wegovy. Both sets of drugs mimic a hormone known as GLP-1 that reduces appetite, causes people to feel full longer and affects insulin secretion. Lilly’s drugs mimic a second hormone, GIP, involved in those processes, as well.Ozempic and Mounjaro are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for diabetes, and Wegovy and Zepbound are approved for chronic weight management; in clinical trials, they were shown to help people lose 15% to 20% or more of their body weight, on average, and guidelines for their use revolve around patients’ body mass index.They’re indicated for people who have a BMI of 30 or more, who are considered to have obesity, or who have a BMI of 27 – considered overweight – or higher and at least one “weight-related” health condition, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.“This is a disease,” Ricks said. “It’s a metabolic disorder that, for most people, won’t go away without serious medical treatment. … So I don’t think we’re going to make much progress on this topic, that affects 100 million-plus Americans, unless we treat it like a health condition just like we do hypertension or arrhythmia or anything else.”Ricks detailed three reasons his company is trying to draw a line on who should get access to these drugs: insurance coverage, shortages and the people in whom they’ve been studied.“We’ve only studied it in a population that had overweight or obesity, and we’ve focused it on people with chronic complications from obesity,” he said. “We can’t speak to benefits and risks outside the population, so we think it’s only responsible to point the light here, where the drug is most needed.”Would Lilly ever study the drug for cosmetic weight loss?“It’s not in our roadmap right now,” Ricks said. “It’s not really our mission. I think people come to work in my company and they want to solve tough health problems, not just make money in healthcare.”Ricks also pointed out the medicines are already in shortage, and he noted the World Health Organization reported last week there are more than 1 billion people globally with obesity.“We’re a long way from being able to supply a billion people with these medications with obesity, let alone the people who may want to lose some weight cosmetically,” Ricks said. “So we need to prioritize, and that’s what this ad’s about, is prioritizing those who need it most.”Lilly didn’t say how many people may be using its drugs inappropriately, but the short supply of both sets of them has left people with type 2 diabetes scrambling to find their medicines. Novo Nordisk had to limit the lower starting doses of Wegovy so it could keep supplying patients already on higher maintenance doses of the drug.Both companies are racing to increase production, building and acquiring manufacturing plants, but Novo Nordisk’s CEO told CNN last year that it could take years to catch up to demand.And insurance coverage is poor, particularly for medicines for weight loss. They cost between $960 and $1,350 per month before insurance or discounts, and “half the people in America who have obesity” don’t have insurance coverage for them, Ricks said – including those covered by Medicare, which prohibits coverage of drugs for weight loss.“That’s wrong to us,” he told CNN. “We would call on all the decision-makers in the health-payment world, starting with the federal government which doesn’t reimburse these in Medicare, to really reconsider that position – that obesity is a serious condition that leads to other serious conditions, and it likely cannot be resolved for many people without medication.”Pressed on whether Lilly should reduce the price of the medicines to increase accessibility, Ricks pointed to discount programs the company has put in place to provide the drugs for as much as half off.But, he said, “that’s not the same as insurance. And again, we don’t think that a health product we’ve made for a serious health condition should be uninsured. We don’t accept that in any other condition.”The way obesity is viewed is the subject of a second new ad from Lilly, twice as long as “Big Night,” called “Shame.”“It showed up when I was young and stayed like a shadow, living in glances of people I loved and ones I didn’t even know, always reminding me of my body’s supposed value,” the voiceover says. “But what good is shame when it comes to health? Health is not about what weight we lose; it’s about all the things a body can gain.”Ricks said the ad is a result of years his team spent with people with obesity, and its goal is to engender more empathy for them, particularly within the health-care system.Lilly said the ads, which are part of a series that began this year with a focus on different diseases – including Alzheimer’s, where the company expects FDA approval of a new medicine this month – would run nationally starting this weekend.Will “Big Night,” the ad admonishing celebrities and others who use the drugs for “vanity,” air during the Oscars broadcast itself? Ricks said he didn’t know. But, he noted, the week leading up to it is focused on advocacy, around World Obesity Day on March 4 and Obesity Care Week.“It just so happens at the end of the week is a big award show, the Oscars,” he said. “And so we’re kind of seizing that moment to juxtapose those two ideas, that this is a serious condition with a serious medication.”“We have to use language to talk about the condition beyond just what, you know, size dress you fit into or whatever,” Ricks said. “It’s not for that.”"

        "category": "health",
        "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration has expanded its investigation into tainted cinnamon products, and its experts now say that the lead contamination extends beyond the cinnamon applesauce pouches that were recalled in October.The agency said Wednesday that expanded testing has identified several brands of ground cinnamon with elevated levels of lead.The FDA says that more than 460 confirmed and suspected cases of lead poisoning have been tied to applesauce pouches sold under the WanaBana, Schnucks or Weis brands that were flavored with cinnamon imported from Ecuador. Those cases, many of them in children, are still under investigation.The agency said Wednesday that it’s sent a letter to all US cinnamon manufacturers, processors, distributors and facility operators to remind them of their obligation to prevent contamination.It has also expanded its testing to brands of ground cinnamon from discount retailers and analyzed those samples for lead and chromium. Based on its survey, the FDA is recommending recalls of ground cinnamon from six distributors.Although the levels of lead found in the ground cinnamon products are far lower than what was found in some cinnamon applesauce pouches, the agency is advising consumers that prolonged exposure to these products may be unsafe.The FDA has advised manufacturers to recall these products and says consumers who have them at home should stop using them and throw them away.The brands are:The concentrations of lead in the ground cinnamon products ranged from 2 to 3.4 parts per million, according to the FDA; the concentrations of lead found in the cinnamon applesauce pouches were thousands of times higher: between about 2,300 parts per million and about 5,100 parts per million.Most people have no obvious immediate symptoms of lead exposure. The FDA says that someone who may have been exposed to elevated levels of lead should talk to a health care provider."

        "title": "70 million-year-old giant dinosaur skeleton found connected from skull to tail",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "A chance discovery made in southern France has revealed a rare specimen — an almost complete dinosaur skeleton found connected from its hind skull to its tail.The massive fossil came to light in May 2022, after now 25-year-old amateur paleontologist Damien Boschetto and his dog stumbled across something unusual while walking in a forest in Montouliers, France. Boschetto had noticed a cliff edge that had recently collapsed and decided to take a closer look, when he spotted an exposed bone sticking out of the ground, local media outlet France Bleu first reported on February 13.The Archaeological and Paleontological Cultural Association at the Cruzy Museum, in collaboration with the French National Center for Scientific Research, identified the nearly 10-meter-long (32.8-foot-long) fossil as a Titanosaur skeleton upon excavation. Boschetto, who has been a member of the association for eight years, told CNN that while unearthing dinosaur remains is “always exciting and interesting for scientific research and the understanding of the ecosystems of that time,” finding the bones in their almost original anatomical position is what makes this find extraordinary.“From a museography point of view, it will make it possible to present to the general public animals almost complete in anatomical positions, which is something great,” Boschetto added via email.A group of history and archaeology enthusiasts created the Archaeological and Paleontological Cultural Association in 1975 to safeguard the heritage around the village of Cruzy, with several members becoming enlightened amateurs in paleontology due to the areas’ wealth of dinosaur fossils, said Jean-Marc Veyssières, a member of the group and one of the fossil preparers for this discovery. Today, the association is made up of inhabitants of the region, including a few scientists as well as students.“The most exciting thing was to realize that we had at least one anatomically connected animal and that it was a titanosaur, a long-necked dinosaur,” said Veyssières in an email. “(Boschetto) is an enlightened enthusiast and curious about nature, he spends a lot of time surveying the region in search of new areas. … He became an expert on the Late Cretaceous fauna of our region.”The association has been excavating the site, which Boschetto referred to as a bone bed, a term used by paleontologists to describe a dense area of animal bones and other fossilized remains, for the past two years. And the newly announced find was not Boschetto’s first.The recently revealed 70% complete Titanosaur skeleton was retrieved during the excavation along with several fossils of various dinosaurs and other vertebrates, including some in anatomical connection and near complete. Other remains identified included those of a Rhabdodon — a herbivore, or plant-eater, like the Titanosaur — and fragments from skeletons of carnivores such as Theropods and crocodiles, according to Boschetto.The Titanosaur skeleton currently resides in the Cruzy Museum’s laboratory, where it will be further studied, Veyssières said.Researchers estimated the age of the newly discovered fossil to be around 70 to 72 million years old, but Titanosaurs roamed around on four legs from the Late Jurassic Epoch to the end of the Cretaceous Period, approximately 163.5 million to 66 million years ago. Titanosaurs belong to a larger group of dinosaurs known as sauropods, a family of long-necked herbivores that were some of the largest dinosaurs of their time, according to Britannica.Remains of Titanosaur fossils are widely unearthed in Europe, but few are discovered in anatomical connection, Boschetto said. Finding a skeleton in this connected state suggests that the body was buried before it had entirely decomposed, leaving “some tissues connecting the bones to one another,” said Matthew Carrano, research geologist and curator of Dinosauria at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History.The completeness of the specimen will “make it easier to determine whether it’s a new species or a new specimen of a species that’s already known,” Carrano said in an email. “It will take time to learn all the details about this new specimen, but I’m sure it will provide important new information about this group of dinosaurs.”The region in which Boschetto discovered the specimen is known to be rich in fossils of dinosaurs and other species living at the same time and is “building one of the largest collections of dinosaurs from the Upper Cretaceous in France,” he said. The association did not publicize the discovery until excavation was complete to protect the archaeological site, he added.The association plans to continue research on the fossils and to further search the area, and the group’s members hope to obtain the funds to “create a large-scale museum that can accommodate and present these collections,” Boschetto said."

        "title": "Why the 2024 eclipse will be a different experience from 2017",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "When a total solar eclipse creates a spectacle in the skies over Mexico and North America on April 8, it will mark the first time such an event has occurred in this part of the world for nearly seven years — and the last time one will until 2044.Total solar eclipses happen when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the sun’s face. But these celestial events aren’t all exactly alike.While April’s eclipse has a path similar to the one that occurred on August 21, 2017, albeit moving in the opposite direction and covering more ground, there are quite a few differences between the two that make 2024’s occurrence one to anticipate, according to NASA. One key factor that sets this year’s event apart is who will be able to see it.NASA estimates that 215 million adults across the US saw the 2017 eclipse directly or virtually.“This year’s total solar eclipse will be at least partially visible to all in the contiguous United States, making it the most accessible eclipse this nation has experienced in this generation,” said Nicola Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, in a statement.More people will be able to see the 2024 eclipse because the path of totality, or locations where people will witness the moon’s shadow completely covering the sun, will be wider. The moon’s distance from Earth varies as it orbits our planet, and during the 2017 total solar eclipse, the moon was farther away from Earth and caused the area of totality to be narrower, extending from about 62 to 71 miles (100 to 114 kilometers) wide.But the moon will be closer to our planet during this year’s event, so the path its shadow will follow over North America is expected to stretch about 108 to 122 miles (174 to 196 kilometers) wide.The path of the 2024 eclipse also passes over more densely populated areas and major cities than before. Only 12 million people lived within the area of totality for the 2017 eclipse, while nearly 32 million are in the 2024 path, and 150 million people live within 200 miles (322 kilometers) of it.People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse, where the moon only blocks part of the sun’s face. A whopping 99% of those living across the US, including parts of Hawaii and Alaska, will be able to glimpse at least a partial solar eclipse without having to travel.April’s eclipse will also have longer period of totality than 2017 because of the moon’s proximity to Earth. Totality is one of the shortest phases of an eclipse, and its duration is dependent on viewing location. Observers closest to the center of the path will experience the longest totality, and the length of that window decreases closer to the path’s edge.In 2017, skygazers glimpsing the longest totality experienced it for two minutes and 42 seconds near Carbondale, Illinois.This year, an area about 25 minutes northwest of Torreón, Mexico, will offer the longest totality at four minutes and 28 seconds, but people across Texas and even as far north as Economy, Indiana, will see totality that lasts longer than four minutes. And when the eclipse crosses into Canada, viewers can still expect to see totality for 3 minutes and 21 seconds.The longest period of totality in recent history was seven minutes and 8 seconds, and it occurred west of the Philippines on June 20, 1955, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.Want to know what you’ll see during the eclipse? Use our interactive map to determine where you’ll be in the path. And don’t forget to grab a pair of eclipse glasses to safely watch the event.While the eclipse is a treat for sky-gazers, the event also offers scientists an opportunity to study the sun in unique ways. And April’s eclipse will allow scientists a special glimpse of the sun during one of its most active periods, called solar maximum.The sun experiences a regular 11-year cycle of waxing and waning activity tied to when the star’s magnetic field flips. The 2017 eclipse occurred as the sun neared solar minimum, when the star experiences less activity.Experts have predicted that solar maximum, the peak of solar magnetic field activity, will occur later this year. Scientists anticipate that exciting features resembling loops, streamers and bright curls will be visible in the sun’s hot outer atmosphere, known as the corona, when the moon blocks the star’s surface from view during the upcoming eclipse. The corona, which is fainter than the surface of the sun, is easier to see during an eclipse, allowing scientists to study it in greater detail.It’s also possible that an eruption of material from the sun’s surface, called a coronal mass ejection, might be visible during the eclipse.Several experiments will fly aboard NASA’s WB-57 high-altitude research aircraft during the eclipse to study the corona with the hopes of capturing new details about its structure across different wavelengths of light."

All orders placed on or before Friday will be fulfilled, according to ASPR, an operating division of the US Department of Health and Human Services.“ASPR has delivered over 1.8 billion free COVID-19 tests to the American people through COVIDTests.gov and direct distribution pathways and will continue distributing millions of tests per week to long-term care facilities, food banks, health centers, and schools,” an ASPR spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday.The decision to suspend the program’s sixth run comes amid falling Covid-19 cases as the nation’s respiratory virus season winds down, according to the agency.Last month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the worst of the season may be over but warned that Covid-19 levels remain elevated across the country.“While the respiratory virus season is likely past its peak, it is definitely not over,” the agency said. “There is still a lot of respiratory virus activity, so it’s not time to let our guard down.”Rates of Covid-19-related hospitalizations remain elevated but are decreasing in some parts of the country, CDC data shows. Still, thousands of people are being hospitalized with Covid-19 each week: more than 17,000 during the week ending February 24, according to the CDC.An ASPR spokesperson says the agency reserves the right to reopen the testing program if needed.The government previously suspended the rapid test distribution program in May after the end of the Covid-19 public health emergency. It was reopened September 25.Residents who haven’t placed an order since then can now place two, which will provide eight tests in total, according to the US Postal Service. Each order includes four rapid antigen Covid-19 tests.These tests can be taken at home and can be used regardless of whether someone has symptoms. The tests should work through the end of the year; some of the dates on the labels may show that they’re expired, but the US Food and Drug Administration has extended those dates.The CDC recommends that people test if they have any Covid-19-like symptoms including a sore throat, a runny nose, loss of smell or taste or a fever.People may also want to test before they’re going to be a part of a large event, like a concert or a conference, particularly if they aren’t up-to-date on their vaccines. Antiviral medications are available to treat both Covid-19 and flu, and testing can help determine which is needed.More information on free testing resources is available on the Covidtests.gov site or at 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489).CNN’S Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report.Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly described ASPR."

        "title": "A man deliberately got 217 Covid shots. Here’s what happened",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "One German man has redefined “man on a mission.” A 62-year-old from Magdeburg deliberately got 217 Covid-19 vaccine shots in the span of 29 months, according to a new study, going against national vaccine recommendations. That’s an average of one jab every four days.In the process, he became a walking experiment for what happens to the immune system when it is vaccinated against the same pathogen repeatedly. A correspondence published Monday in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases outlined his case and concluded that while his “hypervaccination” did not result in any adverse health effects, it also did not significantly improve or worsen his immune response.The man, who is not named in the correspondence in compliance with German privacy rules, reported receiving 217 Covid shots between June 2021 and November 2023. Of those, 134 were confirmed by a prosecutor and through vaccination center documentation; the remaining 83 were self-reported, according to the study.“This is a really unusual case of someone receiving that many Covid vaccines, clearly not following any type of guidelines,” said Dr. Emily Happy Miller, an assistant professor of medicine and of microbiology and immunology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine who did not participate in the research.The man did not report any vaccine-related side effects and has not had a Covid infection to date, as evidenced by repeated antigen and PCR testing between May 2022 and November 2023. The researchers caution that it’s not clear that his Covid status is directly because of his hypervaccination regimen.“Perhaps he didn’t get Covid because he was well-protected in the first three doses of the vaccine,” Miller said. “We also don’t know anything about his behaviors.”Dr. Kilian Schober, senior author of the new study and a researcher at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg, said it is important to remember that this is an individual case study, and the results are not generalizable.The researchers also say they do not endorse hypervaccination as a strategy to enhance immunity.“The benefit is not much bigger if you get vaccinated three times or 200 times,” Schober said.According to his immunization history, the man got his first Covid vaccine in June 2021. He got 16 shots that year at centers across the eastern state of Saxony.He ramped up his efforts in 2022, rolling up his sleeves for shots in both his right and left arms almost every day in January, for a total of 48 shots that month.Then he kept going: 34 shots in February and six more shots in March. Around this time, German Red Cross staff members in the city of Dresden became suspicious and issued a warning to other vaccination centers, encouraging them to call the police if they saw the man again, CNN affiliate RTL reported in April 2022.In early March, he showed up at a vaccination center in the town of Eilenburg and was detained by police. He was suspected of selling the vaccination cards to third parties, according to RTL. This was during a time when many European countries required proof of vaccination to access public venues and travel.The public prosecutor in Magdeburg opened an investigation into the man for the unauthorized issuing of vaccination cards and forgery of documents but did not end up filing criminal charges, according to the study.The researchers read about the man in the news and reached out to him through the prosecutor investigating his case in May 2022. By this point, he was 213 shots in.He agreed to provide medical information, blood and saliva samples. He also proceeded to get four more Covid shots, against the researchers’ medical advice, Schober said.The researchers analyzed his blood chemistries, which showed no abnormalities linked to his hypervaccination. They also looked at various markers to evaluate how his adaptive immune system was functioning, according to the study.The adaptive immune system is the subsection of the immune system that learns to recognize and respond to specific pathogens when you encounter them throughout your life, Miller said. There are two main cell types in the adaptive immune system, T cells and B cells.In chronic diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis B, immune cells can become fatigued from frequent exposure to the pathogen and lose the ability to combat it effectively, Schober said. Hypervaccination, in theory, could have a similar effect.However, that’s not what the researchers found. Hypervaccination in this case increased the quantity (the number of T cells and B cell products) but did not affect the quality of the adaptive immune system, according to the study.“If you take the allegory of the immune system as an army, the number of soldiers is higher, but the soldiers themselves are not different,” Schober said.In total, the man got eight vaccine formulations, including mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, a vector-based vaccine from Johnson & Johnson and a recombinant-protein vaccine from Sanofi.“The observation that no noticeable side effects were triggered in spite of this extraordinary hypervaccination indicates that the drugs have a good degree of tolerability,” Schober said in a news release.While very interesting from a scientific perspective, individual case studies like this must always be taken with a grain of salt, Miller said. Public health recommendations, which are based on very large, randomized control trials, are what people should look to for guidance, she added.“I don’t think any physician or public health official would recommend doing what this gentleman did. This is really uncharted territory,” Miller said. “Talk to your doctor, follow the recommended vaccine schedules, and that should be the best thing to keep you both protected from Covid and healthy and safe.”The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends Covid vaccination for everyone ages 6 months or older in the United States, following the vaccination schedules outlined on its website. Last week, the CDC updated its guidance to recommend an additional dose of the current Covid vaccine for people 65 and older.Less than a quarter of adults and only 13% of children in the US have gotten the most recently recommended Covid vaccine, according to CDC data."

        "title": "Ancient ‘star dune’ evidence isn’t missing. It’s been hiding in plain sight, radar reveals",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Across sweeping desert vistas, spectacular star dunes stand out. The distinctive mounds are among the tallest sand dunes on Earth, and their pyramid shapes are sculpted by a crossfire of winds gusting from multiple directions, creating spiraling sand ridges that pinwheel outward from a central peak.While star dunes are commonly found in sandy deserts worldwide, scientists have long wondered about their formation and their puzzling absence in the geological record.Now, an investigation of a star dune in Erg Chebbi, a region of the Sahara Desert in Morocco, has revealed surprises about its age and growth — and hinted that ancient evidence of star dunes may have been hiding in plain sight all along.Using radar scans and analysis of sand grains buried deep inside the star dune, scientists mapped the mound’s internal structure. The researchers calculated that the oldest part of the dune’s base formed around 13,000 years ago. But for about 8,000 years, the research team discovered, the star dune — which covers 0.4 miles (700 meters) and stands 328 feet (100 meters) tall — didn’t grow much at all. In fact, most of the growth to its present size took place over the past 1,000 years, much more rapidly than expected, researchers reported March 4 in the journal Scientific Reports.“I found their results very interesting because, like most people, I had not suspected that star dunes could accumulate so quickly,” Andrew Goudie, a professor emeritus of geography at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, told CNN in an email. Goudie, who was not involved in the new research, coauthored a study published in March 2021 that analyzed global distribution of star dunes.The new study’s scans also revealed that the dune was on the move.“The whole thing is migrating,” said study coauthor Geoff Duller, chair of the department of geography and Earth sciences at Aberystwyth University in Wales. “It’s moving about half a meter per year,” demonstrating that star dunes are about as active as most other dunes, Duller told CNN.“Knowing how fast these things are moving is quite important for infrastructure in these areas,” as their migration could affect construction of roads or pipelines, he added.The new research centered around the Erg Chebbi star dune known as Lala Lallia, which means “highest sacred point” in the local Berber language. Lead study author Charles Bristow, a professor emeritus of sedimentology at Birkbeck College in the University of London, mapped the dune with a team of geology students. They gathered their data one step at a time, walking over Lala Lallia and stopping every 1.6 feet (0.5 meter) to ping the dune with ground-penetrating radar, “which is hard work in shifting sands,” Bristow told CNN in an email.When these radio waves bounced back to the receiver’s antenna, they produced high-resolution images showing the shapes of different sediment layers below the researchers’ feet, Bristow explained.The next step was to collect sand samples at different depths to find out when those sands were deposited. To do that, the scientists extracted tubes of sand cores from Lala Lallia by digging a shallow pit and hammering hollow pipes made of metal or plastic into the dune “so we end up with these little tubes of sand inside an opaque container,” Duller said. In the lab, the researchers then peered inside individual sand grain crystals of quartz and feldspar to measure environmental radiation that accumulated over thousands of years in the dune’s dark depths.“There’s radioactivity everywhere, at very low levels,” Duller said. “Some of it gets stored within the crystals.”Exposure to daylight scrubs radiation from these crystal reservoirs within 10 to 30 seconds, he added. But once sand grains are buried, radiation from the environment around them starts building up. In the laboratory at Aberystwyth, the scientists made the collected grains release their stored energy as light, then analyzed light intensity to calculate their age, a technique called optically stimulated luminescence dating. The researchers shined a light on the minerals to free trapped electrons, producing a luminescent signal that the researchers then measured to determine how long the crystals had been in darkness.“The brighter the light, the older the sediment,” Duller explained. By measuring the brightness of grains from different depths in the dune, the research team was able to calculate when the structure first formed, when it had its biggest growth spurt, and its rate of movement.The new findings also addressed a longstanding mystery for geologists: Where is all the ancient evidence of star dunes?Desert environments are typically well-preserved in the geological record, and dunes leave behind clues about their distant past in layers of compressed sandstone. But ancient evidence of star dunes is exceptionally rare, save for one known example in Scotland dating to the Permian-Triassic (about 251.9 million years ago).“Why is that? Where have all the star dunes gone?” Duller asked. The answer, the scientists wrote, may be a matter of perspective. Star dunes are so big; perhaps eroded parts of their preserved structures were previously identified as standalone remnants of other types of dunes, the study authors reported.“When you look at each piece individually of a star dune in the geological record, it’s going to look like something else,” Duller said. “But when you get all of these pieces together — and you can see these large troughs of cross-bedded sands in the middle, you can see these arms stretching out in each direction — that’s when you can confidently say it’s a star dune.”One possible explanation for why ancient star dunes were overlooked for so long is that, for a long time, it was unknown just how common they were, Goudie suggested.“The fact that star dunes have not been identified very much in the stratigraphic record may partly be because many geologists were not very much aware of star dunes and only knew about longitudinal dunes and barchans (crescent-shaped dunes),” Goudie said. “Now, with the help of Google Earth, we know just how widespread these features are.”"

        "category": "health",
        "text": "Drinking two liters or more per week of artificially sweetened beverages — the equivalent of a medium-sized fast-food diet soda a day — raised the risk of an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation by 20% when compared to people who drank none, a new study found.Known as A-fib, atrial fibrillation is an irregular heartbeat often described by many people who have it as a “quiver,” “flutter” or “flip-flop” of the heart in the chest.Drinking a similar number of added-sugar beverages raised the risk of the condition by 10%, while drinking about four ounces of pure, unsweetened juices, such as orange or vegetable juice, was associated with an 8% lower risk of atrial fibrillation, the study found.“This is the first study to report an association between no- and low-calorie sweeteners and also sugar-sweetened beverages and increased risk of atrial fibrillation,” said Penny Kris-Etherton, a professor emeritus of nutritional sciences at the Pennsylvania State University, in a statement. She was not involved in the new study.While the study could only show an association between sweetened drinks and A-fib, the relationship remained after accounting for any genetic susceptibility to the condition. A 2017 study found people with European ancestry had about a 22% risk of inheriting the condition.“We still need more research on these beverages to confirm these findings and to fully understand all the health consequences on heart disease and other health conditions,” said Kris-Etherton, who is also an American Heart Association nutrition committee member.“In the meantime, water is the best choice, and, based on this study, no- and low-calorie sweetened beverages should be limited or avoided,” she added.Atrial fibrillation is the leading cause of stroke in the United States. In addition, strokes connected to A-fib tend to be “more severe than strokes with other underlying causes,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Atrial fibrillation can also lead to blood clots, heart failure and “can increase the risk for heart attack, for dementia, for kidney disease. All of those things are likely long term risks,” Dr. Gregory Marcus, professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and associate chief of cardiology for research at UCSF Health, told CNN in a prior interview.Nearly 40 million people worldwide are living with atrial fibrillation, 6 million of those in the United States alone, according to the Heart Rhythm Society, who represents more than 7,000 specialists in cardiac rhythm disorders from more than 90 countries.Many of those people suffer chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath and fatigue. But for others, A-fib is symptomless, a potentially silent killer. Once detected, however, the condition can be treated with medications, lifestyle changes and if necessary, surgeries to slow or restore the heart’s normal rhythm.The rate of atrial fibrillation in the US population is growing: The CDC estimates some 12 million Americans will have A-fib by 2030.“Age is one of the most important risk factors, so with the aging of the population it’s becoming more common,” Marcus said.The epidemic of obesity is also contributing to the growing numbers, along with other risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, smoking and drinking alcohol.“Previous research has shown high soft drink consumption to be association with increased risk of AF (atrial fibrillation),” said Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, in a statement. He was not involved in the new study.“Risk of AF is well known to be associated with type 2 diabetes, binge drinking of alcohol (commonly called holiday heart) as well as illicit drug use (cocaine),” Sattar said.The study, published Tuesday in the journal Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology, analyzed data on nearly 202,000 people participating in a large, biomedical database called the UK Biobank. Followed for an average of 10 years, people in the analysis ranged in age from 37 to 73 years old, and more than half were female.Higher consumers of artificially sweetened beverages were more likely to be female, younger, weigh more and have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, the study found. Those who drank more sugar-sweetened beverages were more likely to be male, younger, weigh more and have a higher prevalence of heart disease.People who drank both sugar-sweetened beverages and pure juice were “more likely to have a higher intake of total sugar than those who drank artificially sweetened drinks,” according to the statement.“Our study’s findings cannot definitively conclude that one beverage poses more health risk than another due to the complexity of our diets and because some people may drink more than one type of beverage,” said lead study author Dr. Ningjian Wang, a professor at the Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in Shanghai, China.“However, based on these findings, we recommend that people reduce or even avoid artificially sweetened and sugar-sweetened beverages whenever possible,” Wang said in the statement. “Do not take it for granted that drinking low-sugar and low-calorie artificially sweetened beverages is healthy, it may pose potential health risks.”"

        "title": "Collard greens, kale’s leafy cousin, have a history in my family",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "When I think of collard greens, I almost instinctively picture a steaming pot of long-simmered leaves, sliced into delicate ribbons or rolled into tight little bundles, swirling among pieces of smoked meat made tender by hours on the stove.This is how collard greens have always been prepared in my family, often picked by my grandfather from his garden after carefully considering each bunch. There have been small changes to the spices and aromatics added since his time, but the technique is always the same.There are few items as closely associated with a singular cuisine as collard greens are with the cuisine of Black Americans.This simmering pot preparation of collard greens is deeply traditional, and generations of Americans have memories of their mothers, grandmothers and aunts tending to a pot of greens while the rest of the holiday meal is being prepared.No celebratory spread is complete without collard greens, especially on the first day of the new year when enjoying a bowl of these greens symbolizes wealth and prosperity for the days ahead.In warmer months and at outdoor celebrations, however, this staple dish is either completely left out or passed over in favor of sides that are easier to transport and add to your plate. And because of the time associated with cooking a pot of collard greens, it’s not something most people will try to whip up for dinner during the week.Whether it’s part of your tradition or not, collards are a good option for people looking to add more nutrient-dense foods to their diet, according to Tufts University.Collards pack a nutritional punch. They are an excellent source of vitamins C and K and are rich in carotenoid lutein, which prevents macular degeneration. As a member of the cruciferous vegetable family, they also contain the cancer-fighting phytochemical indole and sulfur, which helps your body ward off cancer-causing chemicals, according to Stanford Medicine.With this wealth of health-supporting benefits, it’s a wonder collard greens don’t show up on the table more often, and in more ways. When collard greens are cooked in liquid, a lot of the water-soluble vitamins and minerals are lost to that liquid, which is called pot likker. Consume the pot likker with the greens to capture those benefits.It is true that collards are fibrous and have a slightly bitter taste, but that shouldn’t mean they are only relegated to being cooked into submission. Collards make delicious salads. Sliced thinly or chopped like kale, the raw leaves tossed first with a little salt play nicely with all types of vinaigrettes and flavor combinations.The trick is to gently toss and massage the leaves with a pinch of salt and maybe a little acid (a squeeze of lemon juice or splash of mild vinegar) before adding your dressing of choice. This tenderizes the leaves and helps neutralize some of the bitterness often associated with collards.My grandfather would frequently walk the rows of his garden and tear small pieces of the leaves to taste, making sure he cut them before the leaves got too mature. As a rule, the larger the leaf the more developed it is, making its fibers tougher and the flavor more bitter. The smaller leaves will be more tender and sweeter or less bitter, a perfect substitution for kale in salads.That’s why you should purchase young collards that are on the smaller side. Stores frequently carry bunches of collards that are very large, dark green and tough. While I still enjoy these in salads, they are much better suited to being cooked the traditional way. When selecting collard greens for a salad, or to stuff and roll with a filling in place of cabbage, select bunches that are small to medium in size.It wasn’t that long ago that kale was also relegated to preparations similar to traditional collard greens. It took experimentation and intrepid eaters eager to partake in its health benefits to unlock its potential and make it a ubiquitous part of menus across the country.The same can be done with collard greens to even greater benefit. There are culinary applications and delicious preparations that we have yet to uncover from this member of the same family. By rejecting the status quo (no matter how delicious), we stand to gain so much from playing with our food.Want to give it a try? Try my recipe for collard green salad below.Makes 2 to 4 servings2 tablespoons sesame seeds (mixed black and white or just one type is fine)1 pound collard green leaves, washed1 small shallot, peeled and cut in half lengthwise½ a lemon (optional)¼ teaspoon fine sea salt2 tablespoons rice vinegar2 tablespoons soy sauce½ teaspoon ground white pepper½ teaspoon sugar¼ teaspoon mustard powder1 tablespoon white miso paste2 tablespoons sesame oil1. In a small sauté pan over medium-low heat, add the sesame seeds and swirl or toss occasionally until toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside in a small bowl and let cool.2. Cut the leaves in half lengthwise, removing the thick center stems. Stack 4 to 5 half-leaves at a time and slice crosswise into ribbons about ¼-inch thick. (It doesn’t have to be perfect. If the cut is thicker, let it marinate longer at the end; if thinner, marinate for less time. You be the judge). Place the sliced greens in a large mixing bowl.3. Shave the shallot crosswise, slicing thinly by hand or with a mandoline. Place the sliced shallot in the bowl with the collards. Season the collards and shallot with the salt, and, if desired, a squeeze of lemon. Use your hands to toss and massage the greens to distribute until they are dark and shiny. Set aside while making the dressing.4. Combine the rice vinegar, soy sauce, pepper, sugar, mustard powder and 2 teaspoons water in a small bowl. Add the white miso paste and use a fork or back of a spoon to mash and dissolve it into the liquids. Use the fork to whisk in the sesame oil, then pour dressing onto the collards and toss well — like really get in there. Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds over the top and let sit for at least 10 minutes before serving.5. Toss the greens again and transfer to a serving bowl. The salad can also be made a few hours ahead and kept in the refrigerator in a covered container until ready to serve.Recipe adapted from “Sunday Best: Cooking Up the Weekend Spirit Every Day” by Adrienne Cheatham with Sarah Zorn.

        "title": "Thousands of children are landing in the ER after ingesting melatonin without supervision",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Melatonin products have become increasingly popular among US adults and a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 11,000 children have landed in the emergency room in recent years after ingesting it while unsupervised.Melatonin is a hormone produced by the brain in response to darkness and regulates the body’s natural sleep-wake cycle, or circadian rhythm. Melatonin supplements, often sold as flavored gummies, can help someone struggling to fall asleep due to jet lag or sleep-wake disorders commonly seen in shift workers.For the new report, researchers from the CDC and US Consumer Product Safety Commission identified cases involving children age 5 and younger who were taken to the emergency department between 2019 and 2022 after ingesting melatonin without supervision.Based on nearly 300 identified cases, the researchers estimated that 10,930 emergency department visits occurred during that time period, accounting for about 7% of all ER visits in the US for unsupervised medication exposures in infants and young children.More than half of accidental ingestions involved children between 3 and 5 years old and the majority of visits did not involve additional medications.While the type of melatonin ingested was not specified during most visits, the report shows that children had almost always swallowed the product. Based on emergency department visits where the dosage form was specified, researchers estimated that melatonin gummies were involved in nearly 5,000 cases.Melatonin is a supplement and is not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. A recent study published in the journal JAMA found that 25 products labeled as melatonin gummies contained dangerous levels of the hormone while other contained no melatonin and contained only cannabidiol, or CBD.“These discrepancies in ingredients or strength could pose additional risk” to children, the CDC researchers wrote.Among emergency department visits with documentation of the melatonin container, about three-quarters involved bottles — suggesting that young children were able to open the bottles or that the bottles were not closed properly.The researchers said it is important for adults who take these products and live in homes with young children to consider buying melatonin products with child-resistant packaging.Meanwhile, the surveillance data used in the report comes with limitations, including a lack of “narrative” information recorded during emergency department visits. For example, the intended age of a melatonin product was not specified in nearly half of visits, therefore the involvement of a specific product type might be higher than reported.Analyzing cases of unsupervised melatonin ingestion in young children during emergency department visits also underestimates the frequency of melatonin ingestions by children 5 and under, the researchers said.The use of melatonin by US adults soared since the early 2000s, the CDC noted. The rise coincided with a 420% increase in emergency department visits for unsupervised melatonin ingestion by infants and young children between 2009 and 2020.The new report says that the vast majority of unsupervised melatonin ingestions did not result in hospitalization.However, more research is needed to determine if supervised use of melatonin for children is safe or needed. The use of melatonin appears “to be safe for most children for short-term use,” according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, a department of the National Institutes of Health, but it points out that it is unclear how much melatonin is suitable for children and whether its benefits outweigh its possible risks.In general, melatonin side effects documented in children include drowsiness, headaches, agitation and increased bed-wetting or urination in the evening, according to the NCCIH. There is also the potential for harmful interactions with drugs sometimes prescribed for children’s allergic reactions.The researchers for the latest study did not specify whether the children included in the surveillance data experienced any side effects.Parents should always consult their pediatrician before giving their children melatonin, according to Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor in the department of pediatrics at Seattle Children’s Hospital at the University of Washington.“I also tell families, this is not something your child should take forever. Nobody knows what the long-term effects of taking this is on your child’s growth and development,” Breuner previously told CNN.“Taking away blue-light-emitting smartphones, tablets, laptops and television at least two hours before bed will keep melatonin production humming along, as will reading or listening to bedtime stories in a softly lit room, taking a warm bath, or doing light stretches.”CNN’s Sandee LaMotte contributed to this report."

        "title": "Certain types of ‘forever chemicals’ will no longer be used in US food packaging, FDA says",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Certain kinds of greaseproofing “forever” chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, will no longer be used in food packaging in the US, the US Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday.The FDA’s food studies have shown that food packaging materials like fast-food wrappers, microwave popcorn bags and take-out pizza boxes were a major source of dietary exposure to certain types of PFAS, hormone-disrupting chemicals that may persist in the body and the environment.PFAS have been linked to a variety of health effects including changes in immune and liver function, obesity, diabetes, certain cancers and lower birth weights.While health and environmental advocates cheered the new announcement, they noted that companies were already facing pressure from state bans to get PFAS out of consumer products, including food packaging.“I am enthusiastically supportive of getting PFAS out of food packaging,” said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics and population health at NYU Langone Health in New York City, who has studied the health impacts of PFAS. “We are talking about a decent chunk of ongoing exposure.”Twelve states have moved to ban or phase out PFAS in food packaging, said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs for the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.“This is really the culmination of state action to drive PFAS out of the marketplace and, particularly, to drive PFAS out of food packaging, where alternatives have existed for a long time,” Benesh said.The American Chemistry Council, a trade association, said in a statement Wednesday that “PFAS are a diverse universe of chemistries that are critical to many products families rely on every day, including semiconductors and electronics, advanced batteries, modern healthcare applications, and renewable energy. All PFAS are not the same. Individual chemistries have different physical, chemical, and toxicological properties, as well as differing uses.“ACC supports strong, science-based regulation of PFAS chemistries and will continue to work with state and federal policymakers on this important issue.”In 2020, the FDA announced that chemical manufacturers would voluntarily phase out certain kinds of PFAS for use in food packaging within three years, after a scientific review concluded that these chemicals could linger in the body longer than anticipated.“This ‘win’ for public health is the result of FDA research and leadership, combined with cooperation from industry,” noted Jim Jones, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for human foods, in a news release on the milestone.Asked whether imported food packaging could still contain PFAS, the FDA said there are no other companies — beyond those that have voluntarily stopped selling the chemicals — that have FDA authorization to sell PFAS for use in food packaging sold in the US.Wednesday’s announcement doesn’t mean the wrapper of your next fast-food burger won’t contain PFAS, however. The FDA estimates that there may be lingering stocks of packaging that contains PFAS, and it may take some months before that stock is completely exhausted.In addition, the agency said it is working on a validated test that would allow it to monitor the marketplace for PFAS chemicals in food packaging.While PFAS will no longer be in food packaging, the FDA says it will still allow some kinds of these grease-proofing chemicals to be used in nonstick cookware and in food manufacturing equipment.“Current research demonstrates that the potential exposure to PFAS through the remaining limited authorized uses is exceedingly low,” Enrico Dinges, an FDA spokesperson, said in an email to CNN.“Given that the migration potential of the substance to food is considered negligible, there are no immediate plans for the FDA to take action related to the remaining uses at this time,” Dinges said in response to questions.Chemicals called long-chain PFAS stopped being sold in the US due to safety concerns in 2011. Manufacturers then substituted short-chain PFAS, which have fewer carbons in their structure and weren’t thought to be as hazardous as long-chain PFAS, in their products to replace them.Short-chain PFAS weren’t thought to build up in living organisms the way long-chain PFAS do, but research has shown that they may be metabolized into forms that linger in tissue.CNN’s Sandee LaMotte contributed to this report."

The biopharmaceutical company is developing the drug.“A breakthrough designation is a recognition that a drug has demonstrated evidence of clinical efficacy in meeting an unmet medical need with morbidity and mortality associated with it,” said Dr. Daniel Karlin, assistant professor of psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston and chief medical officer for MindMed.MindMed’s MM120 will still go through the standard FDA approval process, including phase III trials.The designation, however, “is an offer from the agency to engage more closely in drug development,” Karlin said. “It affects timelines of response and our ability to get more interactions with the agency so that we can be sure that we’re in lockstep agreement as we move forward.”Two other companies have also received FDA breakthrough therapy status: psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression and to MDMA, (3,4-Methyl​enedioxy​methamphetamine) commonly known as ecstasy or molly, for post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD.A single dose of MM120 (lysergide d-tartrate) led to a 48% rate of remission from generalized anxiety disorder at 12 weeks following the drug’s administration, according to MindMed.The MM120 drug also significantly improved clinical signs of generalized anxiety disorder for 65% of patients within three months, according to results of the phase 2b trial designed to test dosage levels, the company said.Anxiety is the most common mental disorder in the United States, affecting over 40 million people age 18 and older each year, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. Generalized anxiety order is characterized by excessive, ongoing thoughts that are difficult to control and interfere with day-to-day activities.“The clinical improvement for many patients was more than double what we see with today’s standard of care,” Karlin said. “This occurred at all levels of anxiety, from moderate all the way up to severe.”Standard of care for generalized anxiety disorder is a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, and buspirone — both of which work on levels of serotonin in the brain — as well as sedatives called benzodiazepines.All of these medications need time to work and may require experimentation with various doses, adding time and expense to a patient’s treatment, Karlin said.The multicenter, randomized, double-blinded trial tested doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 micrograms compared with a placebo.“We’re very confident based on the results that 100 micrograms is the right dose to bring into our phase three studies, as we didn’t see any more improvement with 200 micrograms but did see additional adverse effects,” Karlin said.Professor David Nutt, director of the Neuropsychopharmacology Unit at Imperial College London’s division of brain sciences, who researches psychedelics, said in an email that the study results “are very exciting data in what can be a difficult to treat population (anxiety).”“They expand the likely utility of psychedelic treatment beyond depression,” said Nutt, who was not involved in the research. “And again, as with the depression trials, a single dose produces enduring effects, probable due to its breaking down persistent negative thought processes.”While it was not the study’s primary purpose, results did show that MM120 also improved signs of depression, Karlin said. “We saw rapid and robust improvement on depression symptoms in people — depression and anxiety have overlapping disease definitions.”Most research with MDMA and psilocybin has relied on the use of trained therapists who meet and establish a rapport with participants before the drug is administered. Those therapists are then on hand during the “trip” to help each person assimilate the experience, thus helping assure the lasting impact of any psychological insights.The MM120 study, however, was accomplished without the use of psychotherapy during the session. Instead, monitors sat in the room to assure safety, but spent their time “mostly reading books,” Karlin said.“While prior research has documented the benefits of combining LSD with psychotherapy to alleviate anxiety associated with life-threatening conditions, this groundbreaking study is the first to show that a single dose of LSD … can effectively treat generalized anxiety without the adjunct of psychotherapy,” said psychiatrist Dr. Gabriella Gobbi, a professor and scientist at McGill University Health Centre in Montreal and Canada Research Chair in Therapeutics for Mental Health. She was not involved in the clinical trial.Compared with experiences with forms of LSD purchased illegally on the street, the study’s grade of MM120 did not appear to induce “bad trips,” Karlin said.“LSD is difficult to manufacture with high purity and tends to degrade quickly in the presence of light and water,” Karlin said. “We’re manufacturing it to pharmaceutical industry standards, a highly pure version that is also shelf stable. So that’s a critical difference.”Most adverse effects in the study were rated as mild to moderate by participants, occurring mostly on the day of the study, Karlin said. Those included euphoric feelings, illusions and hallucinations, anxiety, abnormal thinking, headaches, dizziness, nausea, excessive sweating, vomiting, numbness or tingling of the skin, and pupil dilation.When the MM120 clinical trial began in August 2022, it marked the first time LSD had been studied in a medical setting in over 40 years, Karlin said.During the 1940s and early 1950s, tens of thousands of patients took LSD and other psychotropics to study their effects on cancer anxiety, alcoholism, opioid use disorder, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD. Researchers began to see psychedelics as possible “new tools for shortening psychotherapy.”But when Harvard University psychologists Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert were fired from the Harvard Psilocybin Project in 1963 after the university discovered they had been giving LSD to their students, the use of psychedelics for research began to lose its luster.Leary began to speak out publicly, encouraging young people to take LSD recreationally. He quickly became the face of the drug counterculture movement with his signature message, “Turn on, tune in, drop out.”No longer administered solely in the relative safety of a lab or psychiatrist’s office, LSD began to feature in horror stories of bad “acid” trips at colleges and concerts — headlines that appeared alongside images of anti-Vietnam protests and Woodstock attendees.In 1968, the United States outlawed LSD and research projects were shut down or forced underground. Then came the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, signed by President Richard Nixon. It classified all hallucinogenics, including psilocybin, as Schedule I drugs — substances with “no currently accepted medical use” and a high probability of abuse.Clarification: This story has been updated to more precisely reflect the FDA approval process."

        "title": "Many women fear for their safety when running alone. Here’s how they prepare",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Dorothy Beal switches up where and when she runs to avoid a pattern in case someone is watching her. She also waves at passing runners who appear friendly so that if she goes missing, someone may be able to pinpoint where she was last seen, she says.Emily Scaglione doesn’t wear her hair in a ponytail while running because she fears it could give an attacker something to latch onto. And Veronica Amele avoids putting her hoodie over her head because she says it blocks her peripheral vision if someone’s approaching from behind.Female runners have long endured catcalls and unwanted advances from men who sometimes follow them. But last month’s killing of student Laken Riley, who was attacked while jogging on a wooded trail in Athens, Georgia, has renewed safety fears among women who run alone.Like the abduction and murder of Eliza Fletcher nearly two years ago in Tennessee or the killing of Molly Tibbetts in Iowa in 2018, the deadly attack on Riley is another reminder of the risks facing female runners, several women told CNN.A survey by Adidas of runners in nine countries, including the US, last year revealed that 92% of women say they feel concerned for their safety when they go for a run. More than two-thirds of the women surveyed take specific safety precautions, including running alongside a friend or partner who can protect them.“Any time I hear of another woman’s life senselessly taken while running, it’s a stark reminder that we are never entirely safe and that I must protect myself to the best of my abilities,” Beal says. “But I can be vigilant, even hypervigilant, and something could still happen to me. The responsibility should not be on women to prevent their own attacks.”CNN talked to a handful of female runners across the US about their experiences and the safety measures they take.Dorothy Beal says she has been a runner for more than two decades and has completed 47 marathons. About 10 years ago, she says a man chased her while she was running with her three children in a triple stroller, changing her perspective on safety.The man pursued her in a car and yelled obscenities at her as she pushed the stroller, her body in fight-or-flight mode, she says. It was the first time a stranger had hurled vulgar words at her while she was running, but not the last time, says Beal, a running coach who lives in Brambleton, Virginia.Passing strangers in cars or bicycles also have commented about her body while she runs, she says. Because of these incidents, she’s added several safety measures.“I vary when I run, where I run, and how far I run so that no one can establish a pattern of when I leave my house or where I’m going and for how long,” she says. “Having been chased down by someone in a car before and verbally assaulted on more than one occasion, I try always to be aware of my surroundings.”Beal’s running route includes parks and wooded areas, and she always carries her phone — something she never did before the incidents, she says. If she’s listening to music, she makes sure the volume is low enough so she can hear a potential threat. She also avoids carrying pepper spray because she’s afraid someone could overpower her and use it against her, she says.In the past, she woke up at 4 a.m. to run in the pre-dawn darkness. But not anymore. And if anyone makes her feel uncomfortable, she cuts her run short, changes her route or calls a friend to stay with her on the phone until she’s safe.“Sadly, we live in a world where the time of day, what we wear, or what precautions we take when running don’t matter,” she says. “Things can still happen to us.”Veronica Amele runs about three days a week and never leaves home without her pepper spray, a charged phone and a personal safety alarm stuffed in her sports bra.Her family tracks her whereabouts with the Life360 location-sharing app when she runs. In 2022, she was training on a wooded trail and noticed a man who appeared to be following her. He stopped after she ran in the direction of someone walking their dog, she says.Amele, a running coach in the Atlanta suburb of Kennesaw, says the killings of runners in the past few years have made her rethink her security — and the safety of the people she’s training.She urges female runners to prioritize safety by notifying someone when they’re out running, changing their routes and start times, carrying a safety device and not wearing headphones. She’s become hypervigilant about her safety, she says, which has made her runs more like training sessions and not the decompressing breaks they once were.Amele says she’s always on the alert, with her finger hovering over the nozzle of her pepper spray when someone approaches during a run.“It’s hard to relax when you’re always looking over your shoulder,” she says. “If I see a guy coming toward me, I make sure the pepper spray is ready to go. And when he passes me, I turn around to make sure he’s still going his way and has not turned to follow me.”Her alarm, a tiny gadget with a shrill whistle-like sound, is loud enough to scare off attackers and alert others nearby, she says.She also changes her running schedule and locations to make sure her patterns are not predictable.“Sometimes I’ll go back to a trail after training somewhere else and someone will tell me, ‘I haven’t seen you in a while, did you stop running?’ “Amele says. “It’s kinda creepy, because it tells you people are watching (you).”Sarah Lyon runs about five times a week as part of her marathon training. The Chicago resident runs on a lakefront trail most mornings, a decision she made out of safety concerns.“Cars can’t follow me on the trail, and there’s more space out there so I will be able to see someone coming from farther away,” says Lyon, who works in social media marketing.Lyon says she sometimes gets unwanted catcalls when running on sidewalks, and carries pepper spray on a hand strap so it’s easy to access. She also notifies someone when she’s heading out for a run and tells them what time she’ll be back so they can alert authorities if she doesn’t return.She never wears headphones on the trail, always alternates her routes and is on a constant lookout for potential danger. She says news of Riley’s killing, which occurred during her morning run, has made her rethink her start times.“I prefer to run early in the morning because the city is quiet and peaceful and I love to watch the sunrise. However, over these last few days, I have definitely become even more aware of my surroundings when I’ve been out there,” she says.“The quiet mornings aren’t peaceful to me right now. Instead, I see it as the perfect time for someone to get away with a crime because nobody would be around to see it.”Lyon says the world puts a burden on women to protect themselves instead of putting more effort on preventing attacks.“Society is not doing enough to teach men not to attack women,” she says. “There are far too many people who blame victims when something happens instead of holding the criminals accountable.”Emily Scaglione, a student at Baylor University in Texas, runs about four days a week on trails in parks and wooded areas, she says. Most days, she makes sure her hair is in a french bun — not a ponytail — when she’s running, she says.“Ponytails can be dangerous to run in, because it essentially provides a handle that trails behind you, therefore making you easier to grab,” she says.She also runs with pepper spray strapped to her hand and blares music from her phone without headphones.“I exclusively listen to my music out loud. Although many may see this as obnoxious, it makes me feel safest,” she says. “Not having anything in my ears allows me to be more aware of my surroundings and alerts people that I am coming up behind or around them.”And if she got attacked or abducted, she says, her loud music might draw attention and help passersby notice.She says she’s even taken photos of cars that appear to be following her so that if something bad were to happen, the license plate would provide a starting point for investigators.Scaglione says taking all these measures can feel exhausting and infuriating. She also knows they may not count for much against a determined attacker.“Riley seemingly did everything right; she ran while the sun was up, told people where she was going, and was even close to her college campus, yet it still wasn’t enough. This has just further proved to me that although my precautions are essential, it could not be enough,” she says.Scaglione and the other women all say the recent killings have left them more on edge. But they’re determined to keep running."

        "title": "Do this now to ease you and your child’s transition to Daylight Saving Time",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Here’s one simple thing you can do to ease you and your children into getting up an hour earlier when Daylight Saving Time rolls around on Sunday, March 10 — start adapting today by going to bed and waking up earlier each day until the time change.“Planning for the change can be key to lessening the impact of this change on your body’s circadian rhythms,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine.While most of the United States will “spring forward” into Daylight Saving Time from Sunday, some states such as Hawaii, most of Arizona and the US territories in the Pacific and Caribbean don’t follow the time change.Starting now means an easier transition — the body can more quickly adapt to first five minutes, then 10, then 15 to 20 to 30 minutes of going to bed and getting up earlier than an entire hour all at once, experts say.Adjust the timing of other daily routines such as meals, exercise and medications, all of which are unconscious time cues for your internal body clock.Good quality sleep is critical for health. Science has linked poor slumber with high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, weight gain, a lack of libido, mood swings, paranoia, depression and a higher risk of diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular disease, dementia and some cancers.Prepping in advance is an especially good plan for teenagers, who are naturally programmed to stay up late and sleep late, and for anyone else in the family who is a night owl, said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.Can’t start right now? Don’t despair. Experts say starting an earlier-to-bed routine of 15 to 20 minutes each day for at least four days in advance of the time change should do it. If that’s not possible, do your best — every little bit helps, Dasgupta said.“It’s never too late to start,” he said. “Sleep is very individualized, and every child will respond differently to the time change. Make sure you as the parent are getting the rest you need as well, so you’re not overly irritable with your child.”Younger children tend to adapt a bit better to time changes than older children and adults, so they may need fewer days to adapt, said pediatrician Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor of adolescent medicine in University of Washington’s department of pediatrics in Seattle.Zee, who is also a professor of neurology at Feinberg, agreed: “For most younger children, moving their bedtime and wake time by about 10 to 15 minutes earlier starting three days before the time change can help them adjust to the social clock time change by Monday morning,” she said.If that didn’t happen, expect some grumpiness until your child’s body adjusts, and be prepared to cut them some slack, Dasgupta said.“In the days following Daylight Saving Time, I try to be more forgiving if my child is having an extra temper tantrum,” he said.There are other ways parents and caregivers can ease the transition, Breuner said. Lay clothes out and pack up homework before bedtime to reduce the stress in the morning. It’s also a good idea to pack a to-go breakfast in case everyone is running late.“That way they’re snacking on the bus or in the car versus trying to sit down for a full-on breakfast when everybody’s kind of ‘Whoa, it’s an hour later,’ ” she said.Also, “do not let kids nap,” she added. “That just lengthens any adjustment to the time change.”For everyone in the family, the emerging lightness in the morning is a good thing, experts say. When light enters your eyes, it’s a signal to the brain to shut down melatonin, the hormone the body makes to put you to sleep.“Get morning-bright light for 20 to 30 minutes soon after waking up,” Zee said. “Increase bright light exposure at home, school and work for the rest of the morning.”This strategy is particularly important for teenagers and night owls, Zee said, and they should do this before and continue after Daylight Saving Time starts to help with adaptation to the new time.Breuner advocates for making a “real hard rule” about keeping television, smartphones, laptops, gaming devices or any other electronic device out of the bedroom.“Devices should be off and charging away from the bed, whether it’s in the kitchen or another room besides the bedroom,” she said.“We don’t secrete melatonin to help us sleep when we’re staring at light,” Breuner said.When it comes to teens, don’t fall for the “I need my phone for an alarm in the morning, and it helps me go to sleep at night,” she said. “Get up and get your iPod and listen to some music and get a regular alarm clock.”If a child is struggling with depression or anxiety, not getting enough restful sleep can have serious consequences. “The likelihood of the child having worse behavioral health outcomes is higher,” she said.The same rule about light applies to the evening, but in reverse, Zee said. She suggests avoiding bright light for at least three hours before bedtime: “This will allow your own melatonin to rise and promote sleep.”Make sure your bedroom promotes sleep as well, Zee added, by minimizing light exposure from the outside with light-blocking shades or curtains. Keep lights in the bedroom dim and choose LED lights that have more reddish or brownish tones.Ban any lights in the blue spectrum from the bedroom, such as those emitted by electronic devices like televisions, smartphones, tablets and laptops. Blue light is the most stimulating type of light, which tells the brain that it’s time to wake up.Once you go to bed, keep the room cool and dark — light can creep in even when your eyelids are shut."

        "title": "Maine mass shooter’s brain tissue showed signs of traumatic injury but not CTE",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Tissue samples from the brain of the man who killed 18 people during a shooting rampage at a bowling alley and a restaurant in Lewiston, Maine, in October showed evidence of traumatic brain injury but not the neurological disorder CTE, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation.Robert Card, 40, was a US Army reservist and certified firearms instructor who’d been hospitalized and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation about three months before the shootings. He had no combat deployments, according to records provided by the Army. Card died of a self-inflicted gunshot, and his body was found two days after the October 25 shootings.The Concussion Legacy Foundation said in a statement Wednesday that Card is thought to have been exposed to “thousands of low-level blasts” in his time at an Army hand grenade training range.Low-level blast exposure has been associated with symptoms that can include concentration and memory problems, irritability and slowed reaction times. Research has found that some people who have had low-level blast exposure, such as in the military or in law enforcement, have elevated levels of proteins in their blood that are associated with traumatic brain injury.The Maine Chief Medical Examiner’s Office requested a postmortem study of Card’s brain from the Boston University CTE Center “due to the combined history of military experience and actions,” Lindsey Chasteen, the office’s administrator, said in a statement in December. However, she noted that the findings wouldn’t change the results of his autopsy.The study found that “Robert Card had evidence of traumatic brain injury. … There was no evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE),” Dr. Ann McKee, director of BU’s CTE Center – which frequently collaborates with the Concussion Legacy Foundation – said in Wednesday’s statement. “These findings align with our previous studies on the effects of blast injury in humans and experimental models. While I cannot say with certainty that these pathological findings underlie Mr. Card’s behavioral changes in the last 10 months of life, based on our previous work, brain injury likely played a role in his symptoms.”A traumatic brain injury usually results from a blow to the head or severe shaking forceful enough to shake the brain inside the skull. It can range from mild – also known as a concussion – to severe and cause symptoms including headache, dizziness, loss of balance, depression, anxiety, mood swings and behavioral changes.Repeated brain trauma or shaking can lead to CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a debilitating neurological disorder. It’s a form of dementia that can include symptoms of depression, anger and forgetfulness and is formally diagnosed only after death, through brain samples taken from an autopsy.A federal law enforcement source told CNN that the Army gave Card a “Command Referral” to seek treatment after he said he was “hearing voices” and for having thoughts about “hurting other soldiers.” A National Guard spokesperson confirmed to CNN that Card was transported to the Keller Army Community Hospital at the US Military Academy for “medical evaluation” after Army Reserve officials reported Card for “behaving erratically.”The US Army said in a statement Thursday that the CTE Center’s findings “are concerning and underscore the Army’s need to do all it can to protect Soldiers against blast-induced injury.”The Army and the Office of the Secretary of Defense “are updating guidance on how to mitigate risks from blast overpressure,” the statement says. “In the near future, the Army will begin an Army-wide blast overpressure safety campaign to increase understanding of potential risks, direct risk mitigation actions, require documentation of training environments that exceed 4 PSI, and require tracking of exposed personnel.”The Concussion Legacy Foundation said Card’s family is allowing study of his brain tissue to continue.“We want to begin by saying how deeply sorry and heartbroken we are for all the victims, survivors, and their loved ones, and to everyone in Maine and beyond who was affected and traumatized by this tragedy. We are hurting for you and with you, and it is hard to put into words how badly we wish we could undo what happened. While we cannot go back, we are releasing the findings of Robert’s brain study with the goal of supporting ongoing efforts to learn from this tragedy to ensure it never happens again,” the family said in the statement.“We thank the Maine Chief Medical Examiner’s office for requesting the brain analysis. We know it does not fully explain Robert’s actions, nor is it an excuse for the horrific suffering he caused, but we thank Dr. McKee for helping us understand his brain damage and how it may have impacted his mental health and behavior. By releasing these findings, we hope to raise awareness of traumatic brain injury among military service members, and we encourage more research and support for military service members with traumatic brain injuries.”CNN’s Carma Hassan, Haley Britzky and Nadia Kounang contributed to this report."

        "title": "Alabama clinics resume treatment under new IVF law, but experts say it will take more work to protect fertility services",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Providers in Alabama are resuming some in vitro fertilization services Thursday, the day after the state’s Republican governor signed a bill into law aimed at protecting IVF patients and providers from the legal liability imposed on them by a controversial state Supreme Court ruling.The new law does not address the issue of personhood at the heart of last month’s unprecedented ruling, which prompted some providers to halt some IVF services, and experts say it’s going to take more work to fully protect fertility services in the state.The Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are human beings and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. Three of the state’s limited pool of IVF providers immediately paused services, sending some families out of state to access treatment and prompting a widespread and urgent demand for lawmakers to provide a fast fix.The new legislation, which passed in the majority Republican Alabama House and Senate late Wednesday before Gov. Kay Ivey signed it into law, aims to provide civil and criminal immunity to providers and patients for the destruction or damage to embryos. The legislation will apply retroactively.Under the new law, “manufacturers of goods used to facilitate the in vitro process” or the “transport of stored embryos” also are provided with criminal immunity.While two of the three providers who halted IVF services are resuming those treatments, the third – the clinic at the center of the state Supreme Court case – told CNN the new legislation falls short of providing the legal protection it needs to resume care.Gabbie Price, who uprooted her life and career in order to afford IVF, told CNN on Thursday she was relieved the new legislation passed, but called the law a “Band-Aid.”“I do feel like there’s a lot that needs to be addressed still – and I think a lot of other people feel that way as well – but with IVF being such a time-sensitive procedure, there are so many families that can’t wait,” Price said. “We had to get something in place for those families that could not wait.”Still, the law “does not nullify the Supreme Court’s analysis that says the law ought to treat embryos just like people,” Katherine Kraschel, an assistant professor at Northeastern University School of Law, told CNN on Tuesday.Experts have expressed concern that while the Republican-backed legislation protects providers from liability when it comes to the destruction of embryos, it could also insulate them from standard medical malpractice claims.The Alabama House Democratic Caucus said the new legislation is “short-sighted and does not adequately address the many legal questions of embryonic personhood, nor the serious consequences of the unprecedented and dangerous Alabama Supreme Court ruling.”“Simply put, this legislation is not a solution,” its statement read. “It serves only to avoid a reckoning, at the cost of extending the complications of the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling.”State Sen. Larry Stutts, a Republican and the lone lawmaker who voted against the measure in the state Senate, criticized the language in the bill, arguing it is “not an IVF protection bill, it’s an IVF provider and supplier protection bill” that is “limiting the ability of the mothers that are involved in IVF to have recourse.”US Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat who proposed a national IVF protection bill that was blocked last week, was also critical of the new law.“I’m disappointed that Republican state legislators in Alabama refused to work in a bipartisan way to pass a real solution to this Republican-created crisis that makes it clear: an embryo is not a human being,” Duckworth told CNN in a statement Thursday.Alabama state Rep. Terri Collins and Sen. Tim Melson, Republicans who introduced the state legislation, have noted it was intended to provide immediate relief for families who have lost access to IVF services, while officials consider more permanent solutions.“This addresses the imminent problem and that is what I am trying to do today. Do we need to have the longer decision? Yes, we do,” Collins said last week.“This is the temporary fix,” Melson said last week. “This gets the ladies now currently in the situation, that are in limbo, back in the clinic.”Ivey similarly acknowledged the new law was a quick fix after the court ruling and noted “there will be more work to come” on IVF protections.“I am pleased to sign this important, short-term measure into law so that couples in Alabama hoping and praying to be parents can grow their families through IVF,” Ivey said in a statement late Wednesday. “IVF is a complex issue, no doubt, and I anticipate there will be more work to come, but right now, I am confident that this legislation will provide the assurances our IVF clinics need and will lead them to resume services immediately.”Price cited concerns that the broad immunity meant to protect providers from liability could leave patients without regulations needed to keep them safe from possible medical malpractice.“It does make me a little nervous, and it does make me wonder if it’s going to be harder for those people fighting for those regulations to get them,” she said.Elizabeth Goldman felt like she’d been living in limbo as her IVF treatments were halted. The uterus transplant recipient, who sold her home and moved to Birmingham to start a family, said she was “thankful” to lawmakers for coming together quickly and helping clinics reopen.“This has been an extremely stressful and scary 2 1/2 weeks waiting in limbo while my IVF clinic has been shut down,” Goldman told CNN, saying she’d watched every step of the legislation’s passing and now feels hopeful her “journey can continue after my clinic reopens.”Gabrielle Goidel invested more than $20,000 into IVF treatment in Alabama, before her clinic halted IVF services and she and her husband had to leave the state to continue treatment. She said news of the new legislation left her and her husband in tears.“Although it doesn’t take away from all the hurt and craziness we felt, it feels like we are finally seeing change and feel supported,” Goidel said. “I feel immense relief and hope.”One of the clinics that halted IVF treatment after the state court’s decision, Alabama Fertility, in Birmingham, planned to resume services Thursday.The clinic canceled at least 35 frozen embryo transfers – in which a fertilized egg is implanted into a uterus – in less than two weeks after pausing treatments. The practice already has an embryo transfer slated for Thursday afternoon, according to Mamie McLean, a doctor with the clinic.“We cannot wait to celebrate with our patients. Honestly, we can’t wait to do the first embryo transfer, we can’t wait to see the first positive pregnancy test … it holds even more meaning than it did before,” McLean told CNN before Ivey signed the new legislation.McLean joined families and other IVF advocates at the Alabama State House last week to call for an immediate restoration of services, as lawmakers inside rushed to push through legislation that would protect them.“We appreciate the efforts from the legislators to push through a bill that meets the needs of all of the stakeholders involved in IVF treatments in Alabama,” said McLean. “We are grateful that they have heard our voices. We are proud of our patients who have bravely shared their stories and are so impressed with the advocacy efforts on behalf of infertility patients.”The state’s largest health care system, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, also announced it would restart IVF services that were paused after the state Supreme Court decision.“UAB appreciates the Alabama legislature and Governor Ivey for swiftly passing and signing legislation that provides some protections and will therefore allow UAB to restart in vitro fertilization treatments, also known as IVF,” Dr. Warner Huh, chair of the UAB Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said in a video statement. “While UAB is moving to promptly resume IVF treatments, we’ll continue to assess developments and advocate for protections for IVF patients and our providers.”The defendants in the state Supreme Court case, The Center for Reproductive Medicine at Mobile Infirmary, will not yet be resuming IVF services, according to a statement from the clinic.“As we understand the language of the proposed law, as it stands, we are not reopening our IVF facility until we have legal clarification on the extent of immunity provided by the new Alabama law,” the statement said. “At this time, we believe the law falls short of addressing the fertilized eggs currently stored across the state and leaves challenges for physicians and fertility clinics trying to help deserving families have children of their own.”The American Society for Reproductive Medicine released a statement last week warning that without legislation to address the issue of whether a fertilized egg is legally considered a person, IVF providers are still vulnerable.“We believe these bills will not provide the assurances Alabama’s fertility physicians need to be confident they can continue to provide the best standard of care to their patients without putting themselves, their colleagues, and their patients at legal risk,” the statement read.The Alabama Supreme Court ruling stems from two lawsuits filed by three sets of parents who underwent IVF procedures to have babies and then opted to have the remaining embryos frozen.The parents allege that several frozen embryos were dropped on the floor and destroyed in 2020 at an Alabama fertility clinic and sued the clinic. A trial court initially dismissed the claims, but the state Supreme Court ruling reversed that decision.A fourth lawsuit has since been filed against the defendants in the case.Though the new legislation applies retroactively, it likely won’t impact the case, as the Alabama Constitution holds that new legislation cannot be applied to active cases.Groups representing defendants in the lawsuits that culminated in the Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are children have filed an application asking the court to rehear the case, according to online records from the Alabama appellate courts.The group is asking the court to reconsider their ruling, though the justices could take more than six weeks before deciding whether to grant the application to rehear the case, an Alabama court source told CNN.Some legal experts are skeptical that the court will agree to rehear the case.Even with some clinics planning to resume services, the court’s decision may still have an impact on Alabama families going forward, Kraschel said.“Courts, especially in Alabama, could cite the Alabama Supreme Court decision to treat embryos as people in other areas of the law as well,” she said."

        "title": "‘Cosmic clock’ dates earliest human presence in Europe",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Stone tools unearthed in a quarry in Ukraine belonged to ancient humans who used them more than a million years ago, according to new research.The fresh dating analysis of the artifacts reveals the earliest known presence of hominins in Europe, said Roman Garba, an archaeologist at the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague. The first humans to inhabit Europe made their way from east to west, the report also suggested.Initial dating of the Korolevo archaeological site, discovered in the 1970s, suggested it had been used for more than 800,000 years. Archaeologists have recovered 90,000 stone tools from the site, which lies close to Ukraine’s southwestern border with Hungary and Romania.To determine the ages of the stone tools in the lowermost archaeological layer more accurately, the team used a relatively new dating method that involved analyzing radioactive particles inside mineral grains that were produced by cosmic rays — charged particles that travel through space and rain down on Earth.“It’s like a cosmic clock that unleashes human history,” said Garba, lead author of the study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.The shower of radiation as cosmic rays interact with the atmosphere can penetrate rock, creating cosmogenic nuclides, or isotopes. Scientists measure the rate of decay of these nuclides to determine how long the previously exposed rock has been shielded from cosmogenic nuclides once buried below Earth’s surface where the isotopes can’t form.Garba‘s colleagues measured two nuclides, aluminum-26 and beryllium-10, found in quartz grains from seven pebbles discovered in the same layer as the stone tools. Using two methods of calculation, the researchers determined they were 1.4 million years old.“It’s very complicated to process the samples,” Garba said. “You need two to three months of everyday work to grind, clean and separate the sample.”No human fossils have been found at the open-air site — the exposed conditions make it harder for fossils to be preserved. The soil is also acidic, which can accelerate decomposition of artifacts, Garba said.It’s not clear what species of early human would have occupied the site at that time, but the study suggested it would have been Homo erectus. Scientists believe the extinct species to be the first hominin to have left Africa and walk with a fully upright gait.The earliest human fossils unearthed in Europe are from the Atapuerca site in Spain and date back 1.1 million years, according to the study. In Georgia, human fossils found near Dmanisi are thought to be 1.8 million years old.The now securely dated stone stools from the Korolevo site fill in “a gap in early hominin presence in Europe in both time and space,” said Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, who wasn’t involved in the research.The finding suggests that at least one spread of hominins into Europe was from east to west — and that hominins could inhabit higher latitudes of northern Europe before they colonized southern Europe. “Of course, we can’t know if this was a temporary incursion into this area, or a more permanent migration, without more data from more sites,” she said.“Thankfully hominins left their calling cards — stone tools, and sometimes butchered animal bones — scattered across the landscape as solid evidence of their presence.”The study team also looked at the climate and habitat of the area over the past 2 million years. The researchers found that a warmer, interglacial period, when temperatures would have been warmer than the present day, coincided with the age of the stone tools. Garba said pollen data suggested a forest ecosystem.Korolevo would have been appealing to ancient humans because it’s near the Tisza River, which leads to the Danube, and there was a readily available source of hard rock to knap stone tools, Garba said.Garba and his colleagues said they hope to continue their investigation of Korolevo.However, Russia’s war in Ukraine has made it difficult to excavate and access artifacts from the site, he added."

        "title": "Your pets didn’t get the Daylight Saving Time memo. How to get some sleep anyway",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Every night at 11 p.m. sharp, my dog corrals me into my bedroom, and then at 7 a.m. he has his nose in my face ready to start the day — which might be a problem come Daylight Saving Time.When the clocks spring forward an hour on March 10, I will know that Milo and I have to make adjustments to the routine, but he will not.And that can be a bigger problem than it seems. Although only shifting by one hour, the switch to Daylight Saving Time can significantly impact our circadian rhythms, sleep expert Dr. Rajkumar Dasgupta said in a previous article. Dasgupta is an associate professor of clinical medicine at Huntington Health in Pasadena, California.Fortunately, there are ways to make the transition a little easier for your cats and dogs — and in turn, yourself.The shift to Daylight Saving Time shouldn’t be an issue at all for your cat because certified feline behavior experts Linda Hall and Rita Reimers of the Cat Behavior Alliance recommend not having Fluffy on a schedule to begin with.Since domesticated cats depend on their people to eat, a cat that normally eats at 7 a.m. is going to start getting very concerned if 7:05 rolls around and the food bowl is empty, Hall said.Instead, Hall and Reimers recommend using behavioral routines and phrases to indicate that food is coming. And make sure that feeding isn’t the first thing you do in the morning, or else you will have a feline friend pestering you every time you get up in the night, Reimers added.Hall always plays with her cats for a few minutes before feeding, and now they know not to panic for food if playtime hasn’t come yet. Reimers asks her cats “something to eat?” and that phrase means they can get excited for breakfast.In the wild, cats typically hunt at dusk and dawn, so that is likely when they will be the most active. If you don’t want to be woken up by a playful cat at dawn, Hall recommends putting toys and enrichment activities around the house before going to bed at night so your pet has something to do before you wake up.Dr. Jerry Klein has two dogs, a brother-and-sister pair. One is easygoing, and the other is a canine alarm clock, he said.“Literally, 6:25 in the morning … Zane will be there ready to go,” said Klein, chief veterinary officer of the American Kennel Club.How strict your dog sticks to the morning routine will depend on their personality, but hunting and sporting dogs might be a little more primed to be up and raring to go, Klein said.“They hunt in the early morning hours,” he added. “Dogs are usually as a group much more active in the early morning hours because in nature, they do the hunt in the morning.”You might not be willing to make your morning hunt in the kitchen for their food bowl an hour earlier, in which case you can start making adjustments for your dog now.“The biggest thing is to stick to a schedule and be pretty firm about it,” Klein said.Then, you can inch your schedule back or forward by 15 minutes every day to adjust when your dog thinks all their favorite activities will happen — like when they eat, go outside, take a walk or even when the water bowl is done for the night, he added.Similar to the incremental transition that experts recommend for children, easing your furry friends into a change of a few minutes at a time over the course of several days will be more doable than an abrupt one-hour overhaul.If you have a younger dog — especially one working on house-training — it is important to put a little more thought and patience into the time change.“You have to be more sensitive to their cues because they can’t hold it like older dogs can,” Klein said.To set up a puppy in training for success, adjust the timing of the last trip outside for the day, along with how late you’d like your pet to sleep in, so that the pooch isn’t holding its bladder for an hour longer, he said.Because unlike older dogs, often puppies just can’t wait that much longer, Klein said.Even if you don’t get ahead of the time change early enough and you find an animal pawing at your face an hour before you’d like them to, that should be resolved in a couple of days, Klein said.“The good news is, most pets — dogs primarily — adjust pretty well,” Klein said. “They take their cues from our behavior, and then that becomes ingrained into their behavior.”Wild animals operate by the sun, but domesticated animals set their clocks to us, and they can make the changes they need to make life work well for them, he said.“Nature is pretty smart,” Klein said."

        "title": "Cancer-causing chemical can form at ‘unacceptably high levels’ in certain acne products, independent lab claims",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "High levels of benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, can form in acne treatment products containing benzoyl peroxide, according to a new report from Valisure, an independent laboratory.The report says benzene “can form at unacceptably high levels” in both prescription and over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide products, and results from Valisure’s tests showing that some products could form more than 800 times the “conditionally restricted” US Food and Drug Administration concentration limit for benzene.Tests involving dozens of these products suggest that when benzoyl peroxide acne treatments are stored or handled at high temperatures – such as when left in a hot car at more than 150 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 14 days – they can generate high levels of benzene, the lab announced Wednesday.In one test, a ProActiv acne product was stored at 158 degrees Fahrenheit for nearly 17 hours. The lab not only detected benzene inside the product, benzene gas was found in the airspace around it – which was the equivalent of air typically found in a compact car – at around 1,270 times the threshold that the US Environmental Protection Agency has for long-term inhalation exposure to benzene, according to the lab.Other types of acne treatment products that were tested, such as those containing salicyclic acid or adapalene, did not appear to have the issue of forming high levels of benzene, according to the lab.Benzene is one of the 20 most widely used chemicals in the United States, and people are exposed “mainly by breathing in air containing benzene,” according the American Cancer Society, which was not involved in Valisure’s report.Benzene is a chemical formed from both natural and human-made processes, and it evaporates into the air very quickly.It can be used to make chemicals for things like plastics and synthetic fibers, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s also used in a variety of products including lubricants, dyes, detergents and drugs.“Natural sources of benzene include volcanoes and forest fires. Benzene is also a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke,” the CDC says.On Tuesday, Valisure sent a citizen petition to the FDA in which the lab described an initial analysis of 175 acne treatment products, finding that 99 of them contained benzoyl peroxide, and among those products specifically, native benzene was detected in 94.The petition urges the FDA to “request recalls and a suspension of sales for products containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient benzoyl peroxide.”An FDA spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday that it has received the citizen petition and will respond directly to the petitioner and post the response in the designated public docket.“The agency acts on information provided from a variety of sources, such as that provided by Valisure, but such data must be verified as accurate and reproducible before it can be utilized to make regulatory decisions such as recommending product sale suspensions and recalls,” the statement says.“The agency will continue to provide updates to the public regarding benzene in drug products, as appropriate,” it says. “Drug manufacturers are required to ensure the safety and quality of their drugs.”Last year, the FDA alerted drug manufacturers about the risk of benzene contamination in certain products such as some hand sanitizers and aerosol drug products, noting that benzene is a known human carcinogen that causes leukemia and other blood disorders.CNN sought comment from some of the brands mentioned in the citizen petition letter to the agency but did not immediately get a response from all of them.Regarding benzoyl peroxide products that fall under Reckitt Benckiser’s brand Clearasil, “Reckitt is confident that all Clearasil products, when used and stored as directed on their labels as intended, are safe,” the company said in a statement Wednesday.“The safety and quality of our products is our top priority and we work closely with regulators around the world to ensure our products are safe and effective for their intended use,” the statement said. “Clearasil products and their ingredients are stable over the storage conditions described on their packaging which represent all reasonable and foreseeable conditions. The findings presented by an independent lab today reflect unrealistic scenarios rather than real-world conditions.”Valisure and other companies have previously filed patent applications on formulations or techniques to help reduce the rate of benzene formation in products. “No patents have been granted that Valisure is aware of, only applications that were submitted,” Valisure spokesperson Karrah Goldberg said in an email Wednesday.This isn’t the first time Valisure has sent a citizen petition letter to the FDA regarding concerns about benzene. In 2022, the lab found benzene in dry shampoo products and urged the FDA to request recalls, and in 2021, Valisure detected benzene in sunscreen.“This discovery of benzoyl peroxide’s fundamental instability and formation of benzene is substantially different than Valisure’s previous findings of benzene in sunscreens, hand sanitizers and other consumer products,” David Light, Valisure’s co-founder and president, said in a statement Wednesday.“The benzene we found in sunscreens and other consumer products were impurities that came from contaminated ingredients; however, the benzene in benzoyl peroxide products is coming from the benzoyl peroxide itself, sometimes at hundreds of times the conditional FDA limit,” he said. “This means the problem broadly affects benzoyl peroxide products, both prescription and over-the-counter, and necessitates urgent action.”"

        "title": "Any use of marijuana linked to higher risk of heart attack and stroke, study says",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Smoking, vaping or eating marijuana is linked to a significantly higher risk of heart attack and stroke, even if a person had no existing heart conditions and did not smoke or vape tobacco, a new study found.While both daily and non-daily users had an increased risk of heart attack and stroke compared to nonusers, stroke risk rose 42% and the risk of heart attack rose 25% if cannabis was used daily, the study found. The risk climbed as the number of days of use of marijuana rose.“Cannabis smoke is not all that different from tobacco smoke, except for the psychoactive drug: THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) vs. nicotine,” said lead study author Abra Jeffers, a data analyst at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who researches tobacco and smoking cessation.“Our study shows that smoking cannabis has significant cardiovascular risks, just like smoking tobacco. This is particularly important because cannabis use is increasing, and conventional tobacco use is decreasing,” Jeffers said in a statement.The study’s findings mirror other research that has found daily use of marijuana is linked to an increase in coronary heart disease, heart attack and stroke, said Robert Page II, a professor of clinical pharmacy and physical medicine at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Aurora, Colorado.“The findings of this study have very important implications for population health and should be a call to action for all practitioners, as this study adds to the growing literature that cannabis use and cardiovascular disease may be a potentially hazardous combination,” Page said in a statement.Page, who was not involved in this study, chaired the volunteer writing group for a 2020 scientific statement on medical and recreational marijuana use and cardiovascular health.The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, analyzed data on 430,000 adults collected from 2016 through 2020 through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a national phone survey performed each year by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.People in the survey ranged in age from 18 to 74, with an average age of 45. Nearly 90% of adults did not use marijuana, while more than 63% had never used tobacco. Among current marijuana users, nearly 74% reported smoking as the most common form of consumption; 4% were daily users, while 7% used less than daily. Nearly 29% of daily marijuana users and 44% of non-daily users never used tobacco cigarettes.Younger adults — defined as men under 55 and women under 65 years old — who used marijuana had a 36% higher risk of coronary heart disease, heart attack and stroke regardless of whether they also used traditional tobacco products.Previous research has already found a link between heart disease and marijuana use.A February 2023 study found that using marijuana every day can raise a person’s risk of coronary artery disease by one-third compared with those who never partake. Coronary artery disease is caused by plaque buildup in the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Also called atherosclerosis, CAD is the most common type of heart disease, according to the CDC.Two studies published in November found that older adults who don’t smoke tobacco but who use marijuana were at higher risk of both heart attack and stroke when hospitalized, while people who use marijuana daily were 34% more likely to develop heart failure.Marijuana use is on the rise among older adults. A 2020 study found that the numbers of American seniors over 65 who smoke marijuana or use edibles increased twofold between 2015 and 2018.The American Heart Association advises people to refrain from smoking or vaping any substance, including cannabis products, because of the potential harm to the heart, lungs and blood vessels.“The latest research about cannabis use indicates that smoking and inhaling cannabis increases concentrations of blood carboxyhemoglobin (carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas), (and) tar (partly burned combustible matter) similar to the effects of inhaling a tobacco cigarette, both of which have been linked to heart muscle disease, chest pain, heart rhythm disturbances, heart attacks and other serious conditions,” Page told CNN in a prior interview.“You need to treat this just like you would any other risk factor (for heart disease and stroke) and honestly understand the risks that you were taking,” he said."

        "title": "3 couch stretches that relieve aches and pains",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "After a long day, there is nothing quite like sinking into the comfort of your couch. But what if this simple pleasure could offer more than just the relaxation that comes from flopping down and stretching out? By incorporating a few deliberate stretches into your couch routine, you can elevate this common ritual to a form of self-care.The three stretches outlined below can help you transform your couch time into a therapeutic experience that provides both immediate relief and long-term benefits. Because these stretches focus on areas of our bodies that we tend to stress most in our everyday lives, addressing them during daily couch time can ease and even prevent chronic aches and pains.Ready to give them a try? Head to your couch and follow the instructions below or practice along with the video above.Start by standing just in front of your couch, facing it. Lay your bent right leg on the cushion so your shin is parallel to the couch edge. Step your left leg back, bending your knee down to the floor as you would in a kneeling lunge. You can place a pillow on the floor under your left knee for added comfort. If your right knee is lifted significantly off the couch, you can also slide a pillow under that knee for support.Inhale and lengthen through your torso with a neutral spine. Exhale and hinge from your hips to lean forward as much as you feel comfortable as the intensity of the stretch increases. If you feel OK doing so, you can bend all the way over your bent leg, as in a traditional yoga pigeon pose. Hold the position that feels best for you and take three to five deep breaths. Repeat on the other side.You should feel this stretch in your outer hip without any pain in your knee or low back. If you feel any pain sensation, back off immediately and try the modification below.To modify, sit on the couch with both feet on the floor and bring your bent right leg up to place your ankle on your left leg, just above your knee, in a figure-four position. As noted above, lengthen your torso and lean forward to intensify the stretching sensation in your hip. Hold and breathe, then repeat on the other side.Standing in front of your couch, facing away from it, step your right foot forward and bend at the knee as you would in a lunge. Using an end table or sofa arm for support, lift your left foot behind you and rest it on top of the couch cushion. Bend your left knee down toward the floor as far as you can.Depending on how tight you feel, adjust the position of your left knee closer to or farther from the couch to increase or decrease the stretch in your quads, the muscles on the front of your upper leg. As in the previous stretch, you can place a pillow on the floor to cushion your knee.Once you’ve established your position, exhale, bringing your lower ribs down as you tuck your pelvis under. Feel how this positioning intensifies the stretch in your hip flexors, the muscles on the front of your hip. That’s because your largest hip flexor muscle, the psoas major, attaches to your pelvis; when you tuck your pelvis under, that action lengthens the psoas muscle.Holding the couch or an end table for support, you can increase the intensity and area of the stretch to include your side body by inhaling as you lift your left arm overhead and exhaling as you side bend to the right. Stay in the stretch, side bending with your pelvis tucked, for three to five breaths. Repeat on the other side.If necessary, you can modify and decrease intensity by moving farther away from the couch, keeping your back knee above the floor, and not incorporating the side bend.While standing, facing your couch, bend into a semi-squat position with your knees just above 90 degrees. Place your left forearm down on the couch, centered and perpendicular to your torso. Reach your right arm forward and inhale as you rotate from your shoulder and the middle of your back to bring your arm above your head with both shoulders aligned vertically. At the same time, straighten your right leg only — leaving your left leg bent.You should feel a stretch in your chest, front of your shoulder, low back and hamstrings (muscles on the back of your upper leg). Hold this position for three to five breaths, then repeat on the other side.This is actually a modified version of a windmill twist — a stretch that I recommend everyone should do daily. To do a full windmill twist without using your couch, follow the same cues above but instead of placing your left forearm on your couch, place your left hand on your left shin.Incorporating intentional stretching into your couch routine isn’t just about momentarily easing tension; it’s an investment in your overall well-being and future comfort.So, the next time you’re tempted to mindlessly flop on to the cushions, pause and consider these simple yet effective stretches. Your body will thank you for the extra care and attention."

        "title": "With the decline in youth mental health comes another concerning trend, study finds",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Many young people have reported having poor mental health during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Their experiences are affirmed by a new study finding that the rate of prescribing antidepressants to this group also spiked during the same period.The number of young people between the ages 12 and 25 receiving antidepressants was already growing before the pandemic. But since the Covid-19 outbreak in the United States in March 2020, the dispensing rate rose nearly 64% faster than normal, according to the study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics. (Dispensing, in the context of this study, refers to antidepressants given to patients by retail, mail-order or long-term care pharmacies; it doesn’t reflect use of the medications once purchased.)“The differences by sex are by far the thing that stood out to me the most,” the study’s first author, Dr. Kao-Ping Chua, said of the findings. Chua is a primary care pediatrician and assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health.In female adolescents ages 12 to 17, the dispensing rate increased 130% faster after March 2020, Chua said. For female young adults ages 18 to 25, the rate spiked by 60%.“In stark contrast,” Chua added, “what we see is essentially no change in antidepressant dispensing rate after March 2020 in male young adults, and a surprising decline in antidepressant dispensing rate in male adolescents.”A few earlier studies assessed changes in the post-pandemic dispensing rate nationally, but to the authors’ knowledge, the new study is the first one specific to adolescents and young adults, and to analyze data beyond 2020.“I found myself, during the pandemic, prescribing antidepressants at rates that I never had before,” said Chua, who decided to conduct the research to help inform the conversation about the country’s youth mental health crisis.“I can’t tell you how many pediatricians have told me that they feel like they’re just mental health clinicians at this point,” he said.From 2016 to 2022, Chua and his coauthors found the monthly dispensing rate increased by 66.3%, a trend that surged during and after the pandemic, using the IQVIA Longitudinal Prescription Database. The IQVIA database is a long-term patient prescription database based on retail pharmacy data.“By the second year of the pandemic, emergency room visits for poor mental health in youth rose, and we saw an uptick in visits for suicide attempts or self-harm especially among female adolescents,” said Dr. Neha Chaudhary, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and chief medical officer at Modern Health, a mental health care platform for companies supporting their employees. She wasn’t involved in the study.“As a child and adolescent psychiatrist who has closely witnessed the impact of the pandemic on youth mental health, the results of the study are unsurprising,” Chaudhary said via email.The authors can’t fully explain the findings. But in the context of worsening mental health among youth, “it tracks that we’d see a similar trend in rates of antidepressant prescriptions as these medications are often part of the treatment course for moderate-to-severe cases of mental health conditions like depression,” Chaudhary said.Additionally, growing awareness of mental health, and thus reduced stigma, has led more young people to seek help, she added, as well as exposure to negative current events.On top of those things and pandemic stressors such as loss of loved ones, transition to virtual learning and the lack of social life, some unique factors regarding the state of mental health care during the pandemic may have to do with the increased rate of dispensing antidepressants.Getting and staying on an antidepressant prescription became easier due to the rise of telehealth since patients previously had to visit their providers in person, Chua said.But that benefit had its drawbacks. In normal times, for patients with mild or moderate depression, providers would often recommend a trial of therapy without medication, Chua said. But during the pandemic, the unprecedented demand for virtual therapy resulted in long wait times, making the therapy-only recommendation less feasible. As a result, there was an increased tendency for providers to prescribe antidepressants as a bridge since they couldn’t assume patients could quickly begin therapy.The differences in the findings among male adolescents or young adults don’t prove their mental health improved — they may just point to males increasingly disconnecting from the mental health system, which is “a really concerning possibility,” Chua said.Experts discouraged stigmatizing the need for, or use of, the medications. Antidepressant use is common, Chua said, “and you shouldn’t feel weird about taking them if you need them.”“These medications are extremely effective in many cases,” he added. “They allow people to feel a little bit more normal and to withstand the highs and lows of life. People’s quality of life, their mood and rates of self-harm improve a lot.”In some cases, antidepressants can even be lifesaving, Chaudhary said.However, “there are understandable concerns regarding antidepressants,” Chua said. “They’re not something you start trivially. For young people, there’s a (US Food and Drug Administration) black box warning about increased suicidal thoughts after starting antidepressants.”Potential side effects typically alleviate within a couple of weeks or so; if they don’t, a provider may recommend a different medication.But given the risks, “parents really have to be willing to have a frank discussion about the pros and cons of antidepressants when their kids are having mental health concerns, and honestly, not just shut it down or push them either way,” Chua said.Drastic changes in children’s behavior or mood — such as with their sleep, social life, attitude, school performance, ability to concentrate or interest in activities — may signal a need for antidepressants, but a pediatric psychiatrist can recommend the best treatment plan and answer any questions about medications, experts said.READ MORE: Moodiness or more? How to tell if your kid’s suffering from a mental disorderKnow that antidepressants are typically only started when the benefits outweigh the risks, Chaudhary said.“Young people are struggling, and it’s on us to help them,” Chaudhary said. “If you are a young person or have one in your life, consider checking in on how things are going. It just takes one person who cares to change the trajectory of someone’s life.”"

        "title": "Yogurts can now make limited claim that they lower type 2 diabetes risk, FDA says",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "In a decision nearly five years in the making, the US Food and Drug Administration has decided that yogurts can now make a limited claim that the food may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, the federal agency concluded Friday.The decision marks the first-ever qualified health claim the federal agency has issued for yogurt.Qualified health claims “are supported by scientific evidence, but do not meet the more rigorous ‘significant scientific agreement’ standard required for an authorized health claim,” according to the FDA. “To ensure that these claims are not misleading, they must be accompanied by a disclaimer or other qualifying language to accurately communicate to consumers the level of scientific evidence supporting the claim.”In the case of yogurt, the claim states that according to limited scientific evidence, “eating yogurt regularly, at least 2 cups (3 servings) per week,” may reduce risk of the disease that affects about 38 million people in the US and roughly 462 million individuals worldwide.Underpinning the serving size recommendation is the FDA’s conclusion that, based on two prospective cohorts evaluated in high-quality studies, the specific amount is the minimum necessary to achieve the claimed effect.Made from milk fermented with the bacteria, or probiotics, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, yogurt is rich in calcium, protein, B vitamins and minerals, including magnesium, phosphorus and potassium.The move comes in response to a 2018 petition submitted by food and beverage company Danone North America. The submission set in motion an FDA review of existing research on the relationships between yogurt and type 2 diabetes, according to a news release.“The petition to allow a qualified health claim related to type 2 diabetes to appear on yogurt labels followed the appropriate steps and included peer-reviewed research to support their petition,” said Dr. Caroline Passerrello, a registered dietitian nutritionist and an instructor in the University of Pittsburgh’s school of health and rehabilitation sciences, via email.But in addition to the supporting research being limited, it’s also “not very strong,” Passerrello added. The way the studies were conducted “means we can’t really say for sure there is a causal relationship, but more of a correlation between type 2 diabetes and yogurt.”CNN has reached out to the FDA for comment.Qualified health claims have been allowed by the FDA for dietary supplements since 2000 and for food since 2002, but they are rarely announced. In the past decade, only 10 foods have been allowed to be sold with such claims — including high-flavonol cocoa powder for reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, and certain cranberry products for lowered odds of recurrent urinary tract infections among women.Dr. Marion Nestle, a nutritionist and molecular biologist, echoed Passerrello’s sentiments, adding that “qualified health claims are ridiculous on their face.”“Why would any sensible person think that all you have to do to prevent type 2 diabetes is eat 2 cups of yogurt a week?” said Nestle, the Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health, Emerita, at New York University, via email. “All we can hope is that the yogurt is at least unsweetened, but since it’s really hard to find unsweetened yogurt, this is telling people who want to avoid type 2 diabetes that sweetened yogurts are good for them.”“According to the FDA’s review of the studies, the amount of sugar in the yogurt made no difference to the results,” Nestle added. “Therefore, according to the FDA, sugar is a non-issue.”Any yogurts can make this limited claim as long as they use the exact wording specified by the FDA, Nestle added. High consumption of added sugar has been linked with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in multiple studies.Adding to the dubiousness of the claim is the reality that the cause of type 2 diabetes is multifactorial, so even though yogurt can be part of a healthy, weight-maintaining diet, “to expect yogurt on its own to be causally associated with diabetes prevention makes no sense out of the context of the diet as a whole,” Nestle said.In this context, when evaluating the health claims of products to make the best choices for your diet and health status, using “common sense” is critical, Nestle added.Previous research has suggested limiting added sugar intake to less than 25 grams, or about 6 teaspoons, per day. That’s equivalent to about 2 ½ chocolate chip cookies, 16 ounces of fruit punch or around 1 ½ tablespoons of honey."

        "title": "Ultraprocessed foods linked to heart disease, diabetes, mental disorders and early death, study finds",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Eating ultraprocessed foods raises the risk of developing or dying from dozens of adverse health conditions, according to a new review of 45 meta-analyses on almost 10 million people.“We found consistent evidence linking higher intakes of ultra-processed foods with over 70% of the 45 different health outcomes we assessed,” said senior author Wolfgang Marx, a senior research fellow at the Food & Mood Centre at Deakin University in Geelong, Australia, in an email.A higher intake was considered about one serving or about 10% more ultraprocessed foods per day, said Heinz Freisling, a scientist in the nutrition and metabolism branch of the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer, in an email.“This proportion can be regarded as ‘baseline’ and for people consuming more than this baseline, the risk might increase,” said Freisling, who was not involved in the study.Researchers graded each study as having credible or strong, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak or no evidence. All the studies in the review were published in the past three years, and none was funded by companies involved in the production of ultraprocessed foods, the authors said.“Strong evidence shows that a higher intake of ultra-processed foods was associated with approximately 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death and common mental disorders,” said lead author Dr. Melissa Lane, a postdoctoral research fellow at Deakin, in an email. Cardiovascular disease encompasses heart attacks, stroke, clogged arteries and peripheral artery disease.There was convincing evidence that a high versus low intake of ultraprocessed foods could increase the risk of anxiety by up to 53%, and the risk of an early death from any cause by 20%, according to the study published Wednesday in the journal The BMJ.“It’s not surprising that there are a lot of studies that point to a positive association between ultraprocessed food consumption and the risk of various disease outcomes,” said cancer epidemiologist Fang Fang Zhang, associate professor and chair of the division of nutrition epidemiology and data science at Tufts University in Boston. She was not involved in the new research.“Ultraprocessed foods are high in calories, added sugar, sodium, and low in fiber,” Zhang said. “All of these have already been known to contribute to cardiometabolic health outcomes, weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension.”However, Zhang questioned the findings on studies of anxiety and depression, which tend to be done only on those who have already been diagnosed with those conditions.“People who are having depressive symptoms or anxiety may seek out ultraprocessed foods for various reasons such as self-comfort,” she said. “It may not be that eating ultraprocessed food puts you at high risk for depression — we cannot tell.”Researchers found highly suggestive evidence that eating more ultraprocessed foods raised the risk of obesity by 55%, sleep disorders by 41%, development of type 2 diabetes by 40% and the risk of depression by 20%.However, evidence was limited for an association between consuming ultraprocessed food and asthma, gastrointestinal health and cardiometabolic risk factors such as high blood fats and low levels of “good” high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, cholesterol, according to the analysis.In addition, the study found only suggestive or no evidence for an association between ultraprocessed foods and cancer. That’s surprising, according to Zhang, who has researched the role of ultraprocessed foods and cancer.“Obesity is a risk factor for 13 types of cancers. Ultraprocessed foods increase weight gain, and obesity increases cancer,” she said. In an August 2022 study she coauthored, Zhang found men who ate the most ultraprocessed foods of any type had a 29% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer.One reason for the unexpected finding is that research on ultraprocessed foods is still in its infancy, said study coauthor Mathilde Touvier, research director at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, a public research organization.“We definitely need more studies to be able to upgrade the weight of evidence for cancer, for instance,” said Touvier, also the principal investigator of the NutriNet-Santé cohort, a long-term study of the relationship between nutrition and health.“So it’s not because there’s nothing there, it’s just because we need additional research,” she said.Ultraprocessed foods are much more than simply “modified” foods, said nutrition researcher Dr. Carlos Monteiro, head of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies in Health and Nutrition at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. He was not involved in the new research.“They are formulations of often chemically manipulated cheap ingredients such as modified starches, sugars, oils, fats, and protein isolates, with little if any whole food added,” said Monteiro, a professor of nutrition and public health, in an attached editorial.Monteiro coined the term ultraprocessed food in 2009 when he developed NOVA, a system of classifying foods into four categories. Group one consists of unprocessed or minimally processed foods such as fruits, vegetables, eggs and milk. Group two includes culinary ingredients such as salt, herbs, oils and the like. Group three are processed foods that combine groups one and two — canned goods and frozen vegetables are examples.Group four are ultraprocessed foods, which Monteiro said are made flavorful and enticing by using combinations of artificial flavors, colors, thickeners and other additives that have been “linked by experimental and epidemiological evidence to imbalances in gut microbiota and systemic inflammation.”“No reason exists to believe that humans can fully adapt to these products,” Monteiro wrote in the editorial. “The body may react to them as useless or harmful, so its systems may become impaired or damaged, depending on their vulnerability and the amount of ultra-processed food consumed.”Since Monteiro’s definition of ultraprocessed food appeared, nutritionists, researchers and public health officials have grown concerned about the increasing prevalence of such foods in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and many developing nations.“Two-thirds of the calories children consume in the US are ultraprocessed, while about 60% of adult diets are ultraprocessed,” Zhang said.“I think it’s like when we invented cars,” she added. “Yes, they bring us convenience, but if we use a car for everything and we don’t exercise we have problems. We need new strategies to bring down the consumption of ultraprocessed food to a healthier level.”There’s an easy solution — buy real food and cook it at home. It’s that simple, experts say. But experts also agree that in today’s fast-paced world, giving up the convenience of ready-to-heat and ready-to-eat foods is difficult. In addition, it’s nearly impossible to avoid temptation, as over 70% of the US food supply is made of ultraprocessed food.Regulation by public health agencies and governments should be considered, Monteiro said, such as front-of-pack warning labels; restriction of advertising, especially to children; and the prohibition of sales of ultraprocessed foods in or near schools and hospitals, all while making minimally processed foods more affordable and accessible.In the meantime, Marx and Lane offered the following advice:1) Read and compare product labels and try to choose less processed alternatives. For example, swap flavored yogurt for plain yogurt with added fruit.2) What you include is just as important as what you exclude. Focus on what you can add to your diet such as fresh, frozen or tinned fruits, vegetables, beans and legumes.3) Be mindful of beverages. Sugar-sweetened beverages have no nutritional value. Swap them out for water.4) When eating out, go to local restaurants and cafés instead of fast-food chains. Local eateries are less likely to make ultraprocessed foods."

        "title": "Abortion is the top issue for 1 in 8 voters in the US ahead of this year’s elections, KFF survey finds",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "About half of registered voters in the United States say this year’s elections will have a “major impact” on access to abortion, and about 1 in 8 voters says that abortion is the most important issue driving their vote, according to a new KFF survey.Abortion is a particularly motivating issue for Black women, with more than a quarter of voters in this group saying it is the most important issue to them ahead of the 2024 elections. It is also the driving issue for larger-than-average shares of Democratic women (22%), women who live in states with abortion bans (19%) and women of reproductive age, or adult women under 50 (17%).The majority of voters who named abortion as the most important issue to them say it should be legal in all or most cases. About half (48%) said they would vote for President Joe Biden if the election were held today, while 26% said they would back former President Donald Trump.“One in eight isn’t a majority of voters, and it’s down from the midterms, but it is still a share that could be decisive in tight elections,” said Ashley Kirzinger, director of survey methodology and associate director of public opinion and survey research with KFF. Black women, in particular, are a key voting group that tends to vote Democratic and tends to have high turnout, she said.KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, is a nonprofit health polling, research and journalism organization.During the 2022 midterm elections, just months after the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, CNN exit polls found that 27% of voters named abortion as the most important issue to them – second only to inflation.The new survey didn’t compare how abortion ranks against other issues.Abortion is still a politically polarizing issue.Overall, a little over half of adults say they would like to see the federal government pass laws to protect abortion nationwide, compared with about 1 in 5 who say they would rather see the federal government prohibit abortion, according to the KFF survey.The New York Times reported last month that former President Donald Trump has privately expressed support for a 16-week abortion ban, but the KFF survey found that most adults – nearly 60% – say they oppose a policy like this.Underneath the overall majority in support of federal protection of abortion and against a 16-week ban is a deep partisan divide. More than three-quarters of Democrats want the federal government to legally protect abortion, compared with about a quarter of Republicans, the KFF poll found. And 75% of Democrats are against a 16-week ban, while 63% of Republicans would support it.Biden has a slight advantage over Trump when it comes to reaching voters on abortion policy: 38% of voters said they trust Biden more to “move abortion policy in the right direction,” compared with 29% who said they would trust Trump more.However, a significant share of voters – more than 1 in 5 – say they don’t trust either candidate on the issue.“In an election with two unpopular candidates, the issues could be driving voters more than the candidates,” Kirzinger said.Certain abortion policies bridge partisan divides.An overwhelming majority of adults – 86% – want to protect access to abortion for people who have pregnancy-related emergencies, such as miscarriages. Large majorities of Democrats, independents and Republicans say they support these policies, according to the KFF poll.And more than 60% of the public opposes policies that would criminalize mailing abortion pills to people in states with bans and policies that would prohibit clinics that receive federal funds from providing abortions. Relatively narrow majorities of Republicans support these policies, KFF found.It’s hard to say how much the abortion issue will motivate voters to turn out on election day until there is a more complete picture of the election landscape, including state ballot measures, Kirzinger said.“What we’ve seen is that when it is on a ballot, it’s always gone in the pro-abortion direction and seems to be a motivating force,” she said. “So it could rise in terms of importance, but where we are now, this is where it exists for just a candidate election.”The KFF poll was conducted by phone and online from February 20 to 28 among 1,316 US adults, including 1,072 registered voters. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; among registered voters, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points."

        "text": "A new series about the “Dark Side of Kids TV” will feature former Nickelodeon child star Drake Bell sharing his account of abuse he says he experienced while working in entertainment as a minor.A new clip from the upcoming docuseries “Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV”shows Bell, now 37, taking a seat as he prepares to speak.“Drake Bell will be sharing publicly, for the first time, the story of the abuse he suffered at the hands of Brian Peck, his former dialogue coach who was convicted in 2004 for his crimes against Drake and ordered to register as a sex offender,” according to a press release about the Investigation Discovery series.Investigation Discovery is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Brothers Discovery.CNN has reached out to a representative for Peck and Nickelodeon for comment.Peck, who is also an actor who appeared in multiple TV shows and films, including “Good Burger” and “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody,” was arrested in 2003 and later convicted after pleading no contest to lewd acts with a child. He was also convicted of oral copulation and sentenced to 16 months in prison, according to court records.Peck, then 43, was arrested approximately two years after the abuse occurred, according to a news release from the Los Angeles Police Department. The victim was not identified at the time.Bell appeared in a variety of film and tv projects before going on to star in Nickelodeon’s “Drake & Josh” from 2004 - 2007.ABC’s “Boy Meets World” stars Danielle Fishel, Rider Strong and Will Friedle in a recent episode of their podcast reflected on their own their interactions with Peck, when he guest-starred on some episodes of their show years ago, according to a description of the podcast.The former child stars were joined by therapist Kati Morton to discuss “the difficult subjects of grooming, childhood sexual abuse and their effects on victims.”They detailed what they said were manipulative tactics by Peck that had them believing that he was the one being victimized. They initially supported him in his legal case, choosing his side against the abuse victim and his family in court, which they said they now regret.“Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV” will premiere across two nights, Sunday, March 17 and Monday, March 18 on ID."

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Translating kids’ animation to live-action is a tricky proposition, as Disney and the 2010 movie version of “Avatar: The Last Airbender” can attest. Netflix gets the look and action right in a lavish series based on the Nickelodeon show, but too-elemental dialogue and uneven performances make this eight-episode sit a bit of a grind for anyone who has gotten past puberty.Built around four tribes of “airbenders” with the ability to control water, earth, fire and air, “Avatar” establishes a mythical world filled with strange creatures and fantastic powers, none more so than those possessed by the Avatar, the legendary figure who alone can command all the elements.That heavy burden falls to a 12-year-old boy with a strategically placed arrow on his forehead, Aang (Gordon Cormier), who awakens after a century in ice to discover the firebenders and their leader Fire Lord Ozai (Daniel Dae Kim) have sought to take over the world, and, fearing the Avatar’s return, dispatched Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu) to neutralize him.Taken in by Sokka (Ian Ousley) and the waterbender Katara (Kiawentiio), Aang embarks on an episodic quest through this elaborate mythology, yielding familiar situations, the occasional fleeting hint of romance (which much of the logical audience will likely call “icky”) and no small amount of spinning, kicking, element-hurling action.Adapted by writer-showrunner Albert Kim (“Sleepy Hollow”), the series seems to consciously seek to correct the missteps of M. Night Shyamalan’s lightly regarded film version, without overcoming the creative hurdles raised by having two-dimensional youths as its featured players. The credible visual effects thus adorn what too often feels like a community-theater package, replete with stilted lines about how saving the world must wait if it means endangering friends.While derived from the animated series, bringing its trappings into live-action perhaps most charitably recalls the tone of “The Neverending Story,” a 40-year-old artifact (with more practical special effects) that also put a young boy at the center of its magic-filled journey.Ultimately, though, this feels like another pretty expensive bet by Netflix to capitalize on a proven title and the nostalgia surrounding it, after other animated-to-live-action series like the short-lived “Cowboy Bebop” and more recently “One Piece.”As with the latter show, the result is generally inoffensive, with the potential to run several seasons, but executed in such a blandly earnest way as to be unlikely to win over many who aren’t well versed in the material and eager to take the plunge.On the plus side, in terms of truth in advertising, at least Aang’s arrow is pointed in the right direction.“Avatar: The Last Airbender” premieres February 22 on Netflix."

        "title": "The ‘subversive spirituality’ of Bob Marley is still being overlooked",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Dean MacNeil couldn’t eat. Couldn’t sleep. He was on emotional autopilot because something “tore a hole in the soul of my family and me.”It was the summer of 1991, and MacNeil had taken a road trip from Connecticut to Vermont with his younger brother, Scott. They hiked, jet-skied and spent much of the time listening to Scott’s favorite musician, reggae superstar Bob Marley.A couple of weeks after the trip, a phone call came at midnight. Scott had been killed in a car accident. He was a passenger in another teenager’s car when it slammed into a tree. He was on his way home from a reggae concert. MacNeil was devastated.He found refuge, though, in Marley’s music. He started listening to Marley’s songs again and discovered something: Biblical verses were scattered like gems through virtually every one of them. The lyrics weren’t just nods to the Bible but lengthy scriptural quotations that called the listener to believe that no matter what kind of “changes” and “rages” they were experiencing, they could “never be blue,” as Marley says in “Forever Loving Jah,” a nod to the Rastafarian religion’s name for God.“That accident really sent my sister, mom, dad and myself into a tailspin,” MacNeil says today. “But Bob Marley’s music is what got us through. It helped us deal with the grief and the despair by listening to these messages of hope and perseverance. I went to the classroom of Bob Marley, because my very survival depended on it.”MacNeil found new meaning in the Marley adage: “You never know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice.” He started leading Bible studies at his church and completed a master’s degree in theology. He also became a musician and author of a book, “The Bible and Bob Marley: Half the Story Has Never Been Told.”Today, as Marley’s life is celebrated in a new hit movie, MacNeil and others make a bold claim: Marley’s spiritual impact is as significant as his musical legacy. The two are, in many ways, inseparable. These Marley fans and scholars say it’s time to stop glossing over or editing out Marley’s “subversive spirituality.”“The Bible was as important to Marley’s music as his guitar,” MacNeil says. “You really need to know the Bible to understand Marley’s message.”That’s not the typical message about Marley’s legacy that his fans get today. Since Marley’s untimely death in 1981, he has been defined as a musical icon.His smiling visage adorns T-shirts, bags, key chains, scented candles, lip balm, iPhone cases and posters in college dorm rooms. His album, “Exodus,” was selected as the best album of the 20th century by Time magazine. His song, “One Love” was named the song of the century by the BBC. Some critics even say Marley was the most influential songwriter of the 20th century.This is the version of Marley that primarily appears in the current hit film, “Bob Marley: One Love.” It offers a glimpse into Marley’s life in the late ’70s, when he became a symbol of reconciliation in his home country of Jamaica.But there’s another reason why many people don’t see Marley as a religious figure. There’s a less savory aspect to his personal life that the current film only touches on: Marley was a married man who reportedly fathered at least 11 children, some of them outside of his marriage to Rita Marley.So how can a man who fathered illegitimate children and smoked marijuana be considered a holy man?The answer can be found in the way that Marley lived and died. Start with his music. His musical career began and ended with a Biblical verse.Marley would often start concerts by reciting Biblical passages, MacNeil says. His first published song, “Judge Not,” recorded when he was 17, was based on Matthew 7:1 — a passage in which Jesus warned his followers to “Judge not, that ye be not judged.”The last track on his final album was “Redemption Song” (“How long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look?”). It was based on Luke 13:34, (“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you”).“His faith was central not only to his music but to what Rastafarians would call his ‘livity,’ which is his whole lifestyle, his whole approach to life,” says Vivien Goldman, a British journalist and educator who befriended Marley while working as his publicist.Marley invented a new species of musician: the holy rocker. Other musicians like Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash sang about their faith. But none cherished the Bible like Marley. Several biographers have noted that while on tour, Marley would often withdraw to a secluded spot on his bus to ponder scripture. He would then return to the rest of his bandmates and debate — not over women or song credits — but the meaning of biblical verses.There are classic stories of musicians who were inseparable from their instruments. Jimi Hendrix supposedly slept with his guitar. Marley had the same attitude toward his Bible.Goldman says that Marley never went anywhere without his weathered King James Bible, which had a photocopied portrait of the Lion of Judah in full regalia pasted on the cover, and photos of Haile Selassie I, the former emperor of Ethiopia, on the inside cover. Rastafarians consider Selassie, who died in 1975, as the second coming of Jesus, a Black messiah.“His spiritual practice was absolutely a crucial part of his life,” says Goldman, author of “The Book of Exodus: The Making and Meaning of Bob Marley and the Wailers’ Album of the Century.”“He would make time no matter what — if he was in a busy airport, he would retreat to the side so he could sit and study his Bible.”For some, God and the Bible are symbols of oppression. Both have been used to justify slavery, homophobia and imperialism. But Marley saw God as a liberator, a deliverer from political and personal oppression.In his song “Exodus,” he sang: “Jah come to break downpression, rule equality, wipe away transgression, set the captives free.”MacNeil says it’s almost impossible to listen to any Marley song without bumping up against the Bible. He examined 83 Marley songs and identified 137 Biblical references, comprised of 39 quotations and 98 allusions.Marley’s song, “Forever Loving Jah,” is a prime example. When Marley sings, “Because only a fool lean upon his own misunderstanding,” he’s quoting a scripture from Proverbs 3. And Marley’s album “Exodus” is named after a famous book in the Bible, revered by Jews and Christians.“He’s not just quoting the Bible,” MacNeil says. “He’s actively engaged with it. He’s interpreting it. He’s making it relevant to his own experience. He’s making it relevant to a wide audience.”Marley also made something else relevant to a wider audience: the Rastafari religion. No musical figure has, arguably, done more to popularize a religion than Marley. His beliefs revolved around Rastafarianism.But in the years since Marley’s death, his religious and political beliefs have been sanded down, reduced to a fuzzy, marijuana-inspired haze call for “One love, one heart. One destiny.” Some critics call this the “Disneyfication” of Marley’s legacy.But the Rastafari religion has a much gritter and more defiant edge. It was spawned by the tremendous suffering Afro-Jamaicans experienced for centuries. The slave trade, for example, was even more lethal in Jamaica, where Marley was born, than the Deep South of the US. More than twice as many slaves were shipped to Jamaica alone than all thirteen North American colonies. Most were tortured, raped and worked to death, according to Adam Hochschild, author of “Bury the Chains,” a history of the abolition movement in the United Kingdom.“The Caribbean was a slaughterhouse,” Hochschild wrote, describing the region’s slave trade.The grinding poverty, suffering and political disenfranchisement of Afro-Jamaicans persisted under British colonial rule. Marley was born in rural Jamaica to an Afro-Jamaican teenage mom and a White father. It is impossible to understand him and the Rastafari faith, which emerged in Jamaica during the 1930s, without knowing the country’s violent history.“Rastafari is a religion of resistance that blended Afrocentrism, Judaism, and Christianity,” says Deepak Sarma, a religious studies professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio.“Though it is often categorized as a religion, it is also a revolutionary ideology to right the wrongs of British imperialism, the slave trade, and colonization of Jamaica and other Caribbean islands.”Marley saw his music as a divine calling.“God sent me on earth. He send me to do something, and nobody can stop me,” he once said. “If God want to stop me, then I stop. Man never can.”Rastafarians, though, are known primarily by many casual observers for two elements of their religion: dreadlocks and the smoking of marijuana. The dreadlocks are inspired by an Old Testament passage from Leviticus 21:5, (“They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in the flesh”). Marijuana, or “ganja,” was seen as a sacrament for Rastafarians to deepen spiritual awareness.If there is a founder of the Rastafari religion, many point to Marcus Garvey, a Black Jamaican and activist who preached Black self-reliance, self-pride and led a “Back to Africa” movement in the first half of the 20th century. Selassie is also a central figure to Rastafarians in ways that puzzle some outsiders: How can Rastas worship a Black political figure who was also seen by some as a dictator?Goldman, Marley’s former publicist, recalled asking Marley about the wisdom of worshipping Selassie. She wrote that he was stunned by her question, asking:“So, you want me to worship a white god?”If an outsider fixates on the bitterness of Marley’s quote about a White god, it’s easy to fall for the myth that Rastafarians demonize White people. But one of the reasons Marley’s spiritual beliefs still resonate is his religion didn’t go that route.Marley didn’t limit oppression to one color.“I can’t be prejudiced against myself,” he once said when someone asked him if he was prejudiced against White people.“My father was a White and my mother Black, you know. Them call me half-caste, or whatever. Well, me don’t dip on the Black man’s side nor the White man’ side. Me dip on God’s side, the one who create me and cause me to come from Black and White.”Marley didn’t just live for his beliefs. He also died, in part, because of them.In 1977, Marley visited a doctor after noticing a blackened lesion under his big toenail. He was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer. The doctor advised Marley to amputate his toe to prevent the spread of cancer. But he refused because he thought it would violate the Rasta prohibition against the “cutting of the flesh,” and opted for a less invasive procedure.The cancer eventually spread. Marley died on May 11, 1981, in Miami while trying to return to his beloved Jamaica for his final days. A man who was a fitness and health food fanatic died at 36.Marley was honored with a state funeral in Jamaica at the National Arena in Kingston. He was buried with his favorite Gibson Les Paul guitar and his personalized Bible, opened to Psalm 23, which begins with, “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.”In an interview several years before his death, Marley said a person achieves a sense of immortality by having a right relationship with God.“I don’t believe in death, neither in flesh nor in spirit . . . Death does not exist for me. I truly know God,” Marley said.His musical legacy has found an afterlife. Marley’s stature on the international stage has only grown in the decades since his death. It’s ironic that Marley, a fierce critic of capitalism and materialism, posthumously generated $16 million through his estate in 2023, according to Forbes magazine, right behind John Lennon of the Beatles.That type of immortality, of course, wasn’t what Marley was talking about. He alluded to an “ever-living” legacy. It’s the faith of an abandoned kid from the slums of Jamaica who knew hardship and abandonment but assured his listeners in his classic “Three Little Birds,” “Don’t worry about a thing, ‘Cause every little thing is gonna be alright.”Somewhere in the world right now someone is playing a Bob Marley song to help them get through a difficult time — the kind that tears a hole in someone’s soul.Marley was right. When it comes to his music and his spiritual message — death does not exist.He is more alive today than ever before.John Blake is the author of “More Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.”"

        "title": "How this Oscar-nominated movie conveyed the horrors of the Holocaust without ever showing violence",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "“The Zone of Interest,” Jonathan Glazer’s Oscar-nominated historical drama, is technically a film about the Holocaust.The film centers on the real-life Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss and his family, who live bucolic and seemingly mundane lives next door to the infamous concentration camp.But viewers never see the unspeakable horrors taking place just on the other side of the garden wall. Instead, they hear them.They hear them in the muffled screams, the heart-wrenching wails and the piercing gunshots. They hear them in the distant sounds of trains and in the constant hum of the incinerator.“I knew right from the off that I didn’t want to reenact these atrocities using actors and extras,” director Glazer told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in a February interview. “I feel that that imagery is something that we all know, and it’s seared into our consciousness as it is. Sound, of course, is interpretative. We’re able to see those pictures in our mind’s eye because we hear those sounds.”In a film otherwise short on spectacle, the sound design in “The Zone of Interest” is something of a main character. (In interviews, Glazer has said “The Zone of Interest” consists of two films: “the one you see and the one you hear.”)Those ambient noises are an ever-present, stomach-turning reminder of the evil that the Höss family is complicit in. They signal to audiences that Höss, his wife Hedwig and even their children are perfectly aware that millions of Jews and others are being murdered day in and day out — they’ve just managed to tune it out.“In other words, it’s out of sight but never out of mind,” Glazer told Amanpour.Constructing a sonic depiction of the Holocaust, however, was no simple task.Sound designer Johnnie Burn, whose work includes “Poor Things” and “Nope,” compiled 600 pages of research on the sounds that would have been heard at the extermination camp during World War II, IndieWire’s Sarah Shachat wrote in a piece titled “How ‘The Zone of Interest’ Uses Our Ears Like No Other Film.” That included everything from the planes, trains and automobiles of the era to survivor testimony describing what was going on inside the camp.Burn has said in interviews that he spent a year gathering the audio that makes up the chilling undercurrent of the film. The effort required a great deal of creativity — rather than hiring performers to recreate the sounds of human suffering, he told IndieWire that he collected field recordings from places where one might hear such noises organically, such as the 2022 Parisian riots.“No matter how good an actor is, faking the pain of a severe injury, of fatality, is a very hard thing,” Burn told IndieWire. “And the film itself has such a documentary, natural, realistic vibe that anything remotely wooden is not going to work.”Burn also said in an interview on the Slate podcast “Working” that he recorded audio of voices from across various European cities to accurately portray all the nationalities that were represented at Auschwitz. To ensure that engine sounds were accurate to the time period, he sought help from a man in Estonia with a collection of World War II-era German motorbikes.Another challenge that Burn and his team contended with was figuring out how discernible the sounds of Auschwitz would have been in real life. At the urging of the film’s production designer, he eventually amped up the aural intensity.“It was an enormous amount of people and stuff coming and going every day, and I think (Glazer) and I knew that and we’d done our research, but somehow, I don’t know, maybe it [felt] disrespectful, but we were too gingerly applying the sound and so we went away and we put a lot more in,” Burn told IndieWire.The resulting soundscape is perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the film. And while the film has earned some criticism for its indirect treatment of the Holocaust, Burn’s sonic feat has garnered him industry acclaim — “The Zone of Interest” won the BAFTA Award for Best Sound, as well as the top prize at the London Critics’ Circle awards. It also notched five Oscar nominations, including for Best Sound and Best Picture.While “The Zone of Interest” is, on the surface, a movie about the Holocaust, Glazer and producer James Wilson have said its message remains urgent as ever. “It seems stark right now that we should care about innocent people being killed in Gaza or Yemen,” Wilson said at the BAFTAs. “In the same way [we] think about innocent people killed in Mariupol or in Israel.”“That wall is a manifestation for me of how we compartmentalize the suffering of others — and normalize the suffering of others, to some extent — in order to protect and preserve our own comfort and security,” Glazer told CNN.At its core, Glazer says, “The Zone of Interest” is about what we choose to pay attention to — and what we’re able to ignore.“It’s not saying, ‘Look at what they did,’” he said. “It’s saying, ‘Look at what we do.’”"

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Hulu is bringing the real-life story of Amanda Knox’s wrongful murder conviction and subsequent acquittal to the small screen in a new limited series.The streamer has ordered eight one-hour episodes of the show, currently untitled, according to a news release sent to CNN on Thursday. “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” and “Maid” actress Margaret Qualley will star as Knox.Knox was wrongfully convicted for the 2007 murder of her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher, in Perugia, Italy. The limited series will chronicle Knox’s “16-year odyssey to set herself free,” according to the release.Kercher’s murder in the historic university city of Perugia, and the subsequent trial of Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, was a media sensation in Italy and beyond. Knox and Sollecito were students at the university at the time.In 2009, following a highly publicized trial, Knox and Sollecito were convicted for Kercher’s killing. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison and Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years. A third man, Rudy Guede, was convicted in 2008 based on DNA evidence found at the scene, and he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.After a lengthy legal saga, including a second conviction for both Knox and Sollecito, they were acquitted in 2015. Knox had spent 4 years in an Italian prison before being fully exonerated.Knox and her husband Chris Robinson, through their production company Knox Robinson Productions, are executive producers of the series alongside Qualley, Monica Lewinsky and “This is Us” producer K.J. Steinberg.In the years since her exoneration, Knox has remained a controversial public figure but has been outspoken in her effort to clear her name, through her 2013 memoir “Waiting to be Heard” and a 2016 Netflix documentary “Amanda Knox.”"

        "text": "TV producer Nigel Lythgoe is denying accusations of sexual assault and harassment levied against him by former “American Idol” and “So You Think You Can Dance” judge Paula Abdul. His denial came in a legal response filed Tuesday and obtained by CNN.Lythgoe called the allegations made in Abdul’s legal complaint, filed in December, “false, despicable, intolerable, and life-changing,” according to his response, which was filed with the Los Angeles County Superior Court.“Abdul is a well-documented fabulist, with a long history of telling wild stories that are untethered from reality and are primarily designed to attract attention and make Abdul appear to be the victim of dreadful misfortune,” the filing read.Excerpts of private emails Abdul allegedly sent Lythgoe and posts made on social media made by her that make reference to him are also cited in the filing. Lythgoe’s response characterized these as “adoring messages and comments” that express “positive feelings toward Lythgoe” during and after the period of time Abdul “alleges the abuse occurred.”A representative for Lythgoe did not have further comment on the filing.“Mr. Lythgoe’s answer to Ms. Abdul’s complaint is classic victim shaming. Mr. Lythgoe fails to appreciate that he held a position of power over Ms. Abdul,” a statement from an attorney for Abdul on Wednesday read in part. “He was a producer on American Idol and SYTYCD and she was the talent. He held the cards to her career in his hand and he knew it.”In December, Abdul filed a suit against Lythgoe accusing him of sexual assault and harassment along with gender violence and negligence.The complaint, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and obtained by CNN at the time, outlined two separate incidents that Abdul alleges occurred in the early 2000s and in 2015, respectively.Lythgoe called allegations “false” and “deeply offensive” in a statement to TMZ at the time.In January, he announced that he was voluntarily stepping away from his duties as a producer on “So You Think You Can Dance.”“I am dedicating myself to clearing my name and restoring my reputation,” he said in a statement to CNN following news of his departure.Abdul also named 19 Entertainment Inc., FremantleMedia North America Inc., American Idol Productions Inc. and Dance Nation Productions Inc. as co-defendents.CNN’s request for comment from the companies listed in Abdul’s complaint went unreturned at the time.She is seeking unspecified punitive damages.Abdul’s lawsuit was filed under California’s Sexual Abuse and Cover Up Accountability Act, which allows for claims of “damages suffered as a result of a sexual assault” that occurred outside the statute of limitations to be filed for a period of time.The Grammy-winner served as a judge on “American Idol” for nine seasons beginning in its first season and as a judge on “So You Think You Can Dance” for two seasons.“So You Think You Can Dance” has aired 17 seasons on FOX since 2005. Lythgoe is co-creator of the franchise and has served as an executive producer on both the US and UK versions. He served as a judge for 16 seasons."

        "title": "The actors in this Oscar-nominated film weren’t told how it was going to end",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Matteo Garrone knew how his movie would end.But the Italian director waited until the last moments of filming to reveal the ending to the actors playing the lead roles.“Io Capitano” tells the “Odyssey”-like story of migrant teens making a dangerous journey from Africa to Europe. It won best director at the Venice International Film Festival last year, and it’s among five films vying for best international feature film at this year’s Academy Awards. It also recently opened in US theaters, earning rave reviews from critics and a 96% score on Rotten Tomatoes.The movie stars Senegalese actors Seydou Sarr and Moustapha Fall, playing the roles of cousins Seydou and Moussa, who share the actors’ first names but have very different backstories.“From the outset, they didn’t know whether their characters would succeed in their journey or not,” Garrone has said.For Sarr, whose performance garnered him the best young actor award at the Venice festival, the approach was particularly challenging.“Everything was done on the spot. I’d come in for the day, the producer would give me pages, the translator told me the dialogue…and I slipped into character right away,” Sarr said in a press release about the film. “It was purely instinctual.”That, Garrone says, helped make their performances feel more real. And it wasn’t the only thing he did to ensure the film’s authenticity.The film’s title, which translates into English as “Me Captain,” is a reference to migrants coerced into becoming captains of vessels crossing the sea. It wasn’t an experience Garrone had lived personally, but hearing historical accounts captured his imagination — such as the tale of a 15-year-old from West Africa who managed to navigate a boat full of 250 people across the Mediterranean to safety in Italy in 2014 despite having no maritime experience.To Garrone, the act was just as heroic as a quest in an ancient epic, but that’s not how he saw the stories portrayed. He says the teen who successfully steered that boat, for example, was jailed afterward for six months.“Sometimes (it is) easier to put in jail people that don’t have (a) voice,” Garrone told reporter Hari Sreenivasan on CNN’s Amanpour earlier this year. “It’s injustice, and we hope that the movie will show these injustices to all the world and things will change.”Since he only knew about the migrants’ experience from the Italian perspective, Garrone knew he would need to enlist the help of others to tell the story.The majority of the film’s dialogue is in Wolof, a language Garrone does not speak.“That was the reason I decided immediately that the only way to make the movie was together,” Garrone told Amanpour, describing the team he assembled.The director says he saw himself as an intermediary, connecting audiences with the migrants and their experiences. To do that, he interviewed migrants and researched their stories as he developed the film’s script, and he also had migrants standing by as consultants during filming.“All the extras in the movie were real survivors, real migrants that already made that journey. So they could help me to recreate the authenticity of this journey, the details,” Garrone says. “And yes, we made this movie all together.”Getting it right wasn’t just important for the sake of making an accurate film, Garrone says. A staggering statistic he came across in his research was never far from his mind: Since 2014, officials estimate more than 25,000 migrants have died trying to cross the Mediterranean.“We wanted to be authentic for the respect of the people that made this journey,” Garrone says, “for the respect of the people that died on this journey.”For Mamadou Kouassi, the exploits depicted in the film aren’t just plot twists in a movie.They’re echoes of his own experiences.Kouassi was a script consultant on the film, meeting multiple times with Garrone and his co-writers. He left Ivory Coast for Europe in 2006. And he says he witnessed people abandoned in the desert, was separated from his cousin and was later detained in Libya — all events depicted in the movie.“I started crying during the film,” Kouassi told CNN last year a day after its premiere. “This movie makes me re-experience my life 15 years ago. It is an emotion I had forgotten.”Garrone says the movie’s plot is a composite of multiple migrants’ stories. But Kouassi’s was particularly helpful.“Mamadou’s story was most precious to me, because his account revealed aspects that really surprised me and that I had totally ignored,” the director told CNN last year. “Those are the very human, intimate details that are at the base of the choice to leave their country.”Kouassi told Amanpour it’s a choice many migrants keep making, despite hearing of the dangers ahead, because they’re determined to make their dreams come true.“We decide to cross the desert at any cost. This is the reality,” he said.It’s a reality he hopes many more people will understand thanks to Garrone’s attention to detail and his commitment to telling the story from the migrants’ viewpoint.“Matteo did not leave anything (out),” Kouassi told CNN last year. “He explained — he exposed — the reality and the truth.”And like its lead actors, the film’s audiences will have to wait until the end to find out what happens.CNN’s Thomas Page contributed to this report."

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "In romantic comedies, casual sex isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and the commitment-phobic eventually see the error of their ways. The Netflix movie “Players” follows that basic playbook, but the fun is in getting there, thanks largely to Gina Rodriguez as the leader of a gang of friends who operate like a “Mission: Impossible”-type team for the purpose of orchestrating one-night stands.Nobody should expect too much of a movie in this genre released on Valentine’s Day, and grading on that curve, “Players” happily punches above its weight class and exceeds expectations.Rodriguez’s Mack and her longtime buddies (played by Damon Wayans Jr., Augustus Prew and Joel Courtney) hang out together until it’s time to leap into action and “run a play,” employing one of several tried-and-true methods they’ve developed in order to arrange random hookups.By day, they work for a newspaper where Mack works as a sportswriter, and, in what’s definitely a sign of the times, stresses about whether the next round of layoffs might catch up with her.Before you can say “Boomerang,” though, Mack meets dashing author Nick (“Lucifer’s” Tom Ellis), and tumbles into bed with him, only later deciding that she wants to try and have an actual relationship with him. (“Mission accomplished” would mean being offered a drawer in his apartment for her stuff, which owes a small debt to another movie from this well-worn genre, “About Last Night.”)Although initially horrified that Mack would try to parlay their encounter into a deeper relationship after running a “play,” her buddies join in her elaborate scheme to woo Nick, and one of them, Adam (Wayans), even wonders aloud whether it’s “time to be adults” – a signal that their life of easy hookups might be coming to an end.Of course, nothing’s ever as simple as that, and director Trish Sie (“Pitch Perfect 3” and the more recent “Sitting in Bars With Cake”) and writer Whit Anderson throw in hurdles and wrinkles. Fortunately, Rodriguez spent five seasons trying to figure out who she should be with on “Jane the Virgin,” so she’s got plenty of experience dealing with that particular conundrum.“Players” isn’t here to carve out any new ground, merely to cover familiar territory as pleasantly as possible. And as Mack or any other sportswriter could tell you, when calling a basic play, success really boils down to execution and making the right calls.“Players” premieres February 14 on Netflix."

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "A deeply personal advocacy piece, “The Program: Cons, Cults and Kidnapping” becomes messy at times over its three chapters, although in a way, that’s part of its power. Director Katherine Kubler spent 15 months housed at a facility that’s part of the “troubled-teen industry,” enlisting other alumni in a Netflix exposé that seeks to drive a nail into the coffin of the practice.Kubler assembles a group of others who were sent away, mostly at the age of 15 or 16, to The Academy at Ivy Ridge, a disciplinary facility in New York state near the Canadian border. Once taken there, the youths were cut off from the outside world, forced to adhere to strange guidelines and in some instances, allegedly, physically abused, beginning with the strip search to which they were subjected on arrival.Now adults, Kubler’s peers talk about a “no camera” room, where staff could manhandle those perceived as acting up without fear of being videotaped, while showing jarring recorded evidence from other rooms equipped with cameras. Some of the former Ivy Ridge classmates (although calling this a “campus” feels like a stretch) say they lied about their drug use – admitting to things they hadn’t done – to avoid punishment, essentially telling their captors what they wanted to hear.“They were being treated like prisoners,” one former staff member, who didn’t last long in the job, tells Kubler, though the investigation finds that the staff were basically told these were bad kids, justifying the harsh techniques.According to those who endured the program, which operated under a system that deducted and added points toward securing their release, there were penalties for trying to write parents and family alerting them to what was really happening.The fact that parents not only sent their children away but forced them to stay there is only one of the troubling aspects of this story. The grown-up youths’ testimony consistently reveals lingering feelings of betrayal, a point Kubler drives home by discussing her strained relationship, years later, with her father, who is among those interviewed.“They sold it as tough love,” says attorney Phil Elberg, one of the outside voices that Kubler enlists to dissect the market for “troubled teen” care, before devoting the final hour to who was behind the Academy as well as similar facilities and profiting from them.Kubler stresses throughout that she’s not a journalist, but rather someone seeking answers to what happened then, shining a light on the emotional scars suffered by Ivy Ridge survivors. While that venue has closed, her crusade includes advocating to put such programs elsewhere out of business today.There’s also, unexpectedly, a fair amount of laughter as Kubler and her contemporaries reminisce, swapping stories and anecdotes now about the absurdity of it all in a way they couldn’t do then because of the “no talking” rule.As noted, “The Program” careens about almost drunkenly from topic to topic, but in its totality the three hours paint a harrowing portrait of parents casting about for a way to help their kids and instead subjecting them to pain and trauma.Netflix has invested heavily in “true crime” docuseries, which charitably pay the bills to allow for this sort of outside-the-box project. From that perspective Kubler might not be an accomplished documentarian, but she and the others sharing their memories get their points across loud and clear.“The Program: Cons, Cults and Kidnapping” premieres March 5 on Netflix."

        "title": "Kate Winslet’s golden streak of HBO miniseries fizzles with the satirical ‘The Regime’",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "After her Emmy-winning roles in “Mildred Pierce” and “Mare of Easttown,” HBO would probably say “yes” to a series in which Kate Winslet reads the phone book. Alas, they’ve come a little too close to that with “The Regime,” a political satire that’s weird but not very good, other than savoring Winslet’s over-the-top antics as an autocratic leader.Political satire can be hard work, and this creation from writer Will Tracy (whose credits include “The Menu” and “Succession”), working with directors Stephen Frears and Jessica Hobbs (whose regal credentials include “The Queen” and “The Crown,” respectively), too often goes for the broad and below the belt, which makes it feel less savvy than it clearly aspires to be.Paranoid and mercurial, Winslet’s Chancellor Elena Vernham heads a fictional country in Central Europe, whose possession of cobalt mines forces representatives of bigger nations – including a US senator (Martha Plimpton) – to take an interest in its stability and future.When the story begins, Vernham is already engaging in odd behavior that leaves her ministers (who assemble in “Dr. Strangelove”-esque meeting rooms) exchanging pained expressions, before she recruits a disgraced soldier, Herbert Zubak (Matthias Schoenaerts, seen in “Amsterdam” and “Red Sparrow”), as her confidant and near-constant companion. Confused at first, Herbert gradually occupies an increasingly significant role in affairs of state, which only makes Vernham’s stewardship, and her grip on her exalted position, more tenuous.Like everything else in this six-episode series, the Elena-Herbert relationship is decidedly strange, confounding her aide (Andrea Riseborough) and husband (Guillaume Gallienne). As for the ministers, eager to protect their phony-baloney jobs, they privately express hope she’ll simply become bored with this latest plaything, implying that Herbert isn’t the first stray the chancellor has brought into her orbit.While there’s a seemingly fertile idea in watching how an autocracy crumbles from within and without, as unchecked power breeds a kind of insanity, the more cerebral aspects largely get lost in the show’s eccentricities, overwhelming any sense of nuance.Isolated from her people in a garish palace, there’s some logic in Elena seeking out someone like Herbert as an anchor, but his quirks merely add to the lunacy, clouding who’s really manipulating whom. Even what amounts to an extended cameo by Hugh Grant as an imprisoned rival can’t do much to class up the joint.Lustily sneering her dialogue in an exaggerated accent, Winslet throws her all into the character, but to what end? Forced to exit the palace, the delusional leader finds herself needing help at one point, saying naively, “No one could refuse my face.”HBO, understandably, would have found it difficult saying “no” to a limited series with the deservedly decorated star at its center. But after watching “The Regime,” consider this an offer they probably should have refused.“The Regime” premieres March 3 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery."

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Chloe Fineman might be known by some as the chief impressionist at “SNL,” but she says that she might walk away from the 49th season with a new moniker.“I’m ‘Girl who’s hoisted by hunky men’ this year, and I’m really not mad about it,” she joked to CNN recently, making reference to two memorable sketches that had her jumping into the arms of “Aquaman” star Jason Momoa and “Euphoria” star Jacob Elordi, respectively.Indeed, it has been quite the season for Fineman, who has been on the long-running sketch show since 2019. It’s seen her do street ballet with Julia Stiles and come face-to-face with Timothée Chalamet after doing an uncanny impression of him.In the midst of promoting her new campaign with NÜTRL Vodka Seltzer, Fineman spoke to CNN about some of her buzziest sketches from what has arguably been her best season yet.It wasn’t until roughly 11:30 p.m. on the Friday night before the live taping of a December episode of “SNL” that Fineman got word from a producer that the “Save the Last Dance” sketch she had pitched was a go.And as the clock struck midnight, the first call was made to the 2001 movie’s star Julia Stiles to see if she was available to make a cameo in the sketch that paid homage to the film. Luckily, Stiles was not only up at that hour, but she was down to rally.“She just happened to be in New York and was like, ‘Sure, yeah, I’ll get a sitter!’” Fineman said.The last-minute decision to move forward with the sketch left little time to prepare before showtime.Reading cue cards while simultaneously performing choreography on a live show was a new challenge for Fineman, so she worked hard with a choreographer to learn the dance on the day of the live show “in this weird gym we have in 30 Rock that supposedly only Seth Meyers works out at.”Stiles arrived around 5 p.m. to rehearse with Fineman, and she came ready to “practice and get it right.”The sketch features Stiles and Fineman demonstrating that her idea of the perfect “intimate” holiday gift is the pivotal Juilliard audition dance that Stiles’ character performs at the end of the movie. Fineman explains the plot while performing her hilarious spin on the routine.At the end, Stiles was met with raucous cheers and applause when she took the “SNL” stage to perform with Fineman in the surprise cameo.“For the audience to freak out the way they did,” Fineman said, “I thought it was so special and so cool.”While the sketch was a success, the final product wasn’t how it was initially intended. According to Fineman, it was originally written for Adam Driver, who hosted the episode and would’ve been the recipient of her steamy holiday “gift” until the sketch changed direction to include Stiles instead.“I did a table read and Adam Driver’s just looking at me and I’m like, ‘Another day at the office making a fool out of myself with, like, the greatest actor of our generation. Cool, cool, cool,’” she recalled, laughing.The first time Timothée Chalamet hosted “SNL,” Fineman appeared in a sketch doing an impression of him.So when Chalamet returned to host “SNL” for the second time in November and appeared in a sketch with Fineman once again playing him, it was not the first time he’d gotten to witness Fineman’s take on him up close.The sketch was a pre-taped segment that aired during the live broadcast and featured Fineman and various cast members doing impressions of celebrities auditioning to be the audiobook narrator of Britney Spears’ 2023 memoir “The Woman in Me.”Fineman opens the sketch with her iconic impression of Spears before she appears as a laughing, mumbling Chalamet. Fineman’s version of Chalamet in this sketch hilariously can’t read his lines, but it was an impression that she had some trepidation about doing.“At first I was like, ‘I don’t want to do this, I don’t want to make him uncomfortable because I really love him,’” she admitted. But the team of seasoned writers on the show encouraged her to just trust the process.Their advice paid off.“He really got a kick out of it; he was really laughing!” She said. “My favorite [thing] is he laughs the way that my impression laughs, so then it’s sort of this meta, crazy thing.”Fineman came up with the concept for the sketch shortly after Spears’ buzzy memoir was released. She worked with “SNL” writers Jake Nordwind and Mike DiCenzo on the angle, picking which impressions to include and who on the cast could portray them.“It’s kind of the joy of the show: You have all these amazing people who can surprise you with their impressions,” she said of her cast mates, highlighting Molly Kearney’s impression of actor Kevin James and Mikey Day’s Steve-O. “I love a sketch like that because everybody scores.”At the end of the day, the celebrities Fineman does impressions of are chosen carefully and always done in admiration. “I’m never going to do an impression of someone who I think has no sense of humor or who’s fragile,” she said.Fineman isn’t quite sure how she got the lucky role of playing a character that shares an on-screen kiss with Jacob Elordi during a January sketch, but she has one sneaking suspicion.“I also got the lucky role with Jason Momoa, getting hoisted by a hunk,” she said of a sketch that aired in November when the “Aquaman” actor was the episode’s host. “Maybe it’s because it went so well with Jason Momoa they were like, let’s try it with Jacob.”In the Elordi sketch, Fineman’s character is the lead on a dating reality show geared toward men of less-than-average height. She ends up choosing the 6 foot 5 tall Elordi, who she engages in an over-dramatic kiss with at the end.It was all in good fun, according to Fineman, who said Elordi and Momoa are “some of the nicest hosts we’ve ever had and so easygoing” about the intimate sketches.“To be honest, they were like, ‘Yeah, sure, whatever,’ and knew that it was funny. It was just easy,” she said. “They were lovely and so tall.”Fineman, a self-described “short queen,” admits that she had to practice some self-restraint when coming into close contact with some of the show’s hunkiest hosts, equating her nerves to that girlish high school feeling one may get when running into a crush.“I’m just like, ‘just play it cool,’” she joked. “I just try and not be weird, which is obviously the hardest thing to do when you’re hoisted by Momoa.”The Elordi and Momoa sketches were written by Nordwind and DiCenzo but Fineman revealed that she, too, had written and pitched a sketch for Chalamet’s episode “where he hoisted me and we had to kiss.”Alas, the Chalamet sketch got cut during the episode’s dress rehearsal, but it became clear to Fineman that a pattern was emerging.“I feel like part of it is that if it’s my idea, it doesn’t happen. If it’s someone else’s, then I don’t know, maybe it just works out,” she hypothesized.“SNL” airs Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. EDT/8:30 p.m. PDT on NBC. This week’s host is comedian Shane Gillis with musical guest 21 Savage."

        "title": "Let ‘Dune: Part Two’ inspire you to revisit these other timeless sci-fi sequels",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "“Dune: Part Two” is landing in theaters this weekend, and the movie is already a promising franchise hit, with (to date) an impressive 94% critical rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and an audience score one percentage point higher.After 2021’s first entry fared similarly well – and picked up a total of six Academy Awards – the zeitgeist is inevitably comparing director Denis Villeneuve’s sprawling world of “Dune” to those of “Star Wars” and “Lord of the Rings.” With that said, there’s no time like the present to use Arrakis, the desert planet at the heart of “Dune,” as the jumping-off point to explore other amazing sequels in science-fiction, a genre that’s luckily been fertile ground for various second chapters in cinema.Behold, a list of some the most notable, in no particular order.What better way to start off than with one of the greatest sequels – and sci-fi films in general – ever made, with a screenplay that’s been taught in film schools. James Cameron’s Oscar-winning followup to Ridley Scott’s haunted-house-in-space classic from 1979 broke the mold in many ways, from its deft ability to develop every member of the ensemble cast of mercenaries to the heart-wrenching crux of the story, Ellen Ripley’s (Sigourney Weaver) fiercely protective and maternal relationship with a young survivor named Newt (Carrie Henn). And that’s not to mention the absolutely iconic face-off between Ripley and another maternal figure in the movie – namely the horrifying Alien Queen, as seen above.A groundbreaking achievement in terms of special effects and world-building at the time, “Star Trek II” was a sequel no one saw coming, as it felt very different from the troubled first feature film based on the historic television series. From early use of CGI to full-throttle performances from both heroic William Shatner and villainous Ricardo Montalban, “Khan” stands the test of time – especially with that whopper of an ending.James Cameron (yes, he’s been referred to as the king of sequels) struck cinematic sequel gold again with his awe-inspiring revisit of a world fated to be dominated by evil killer robots, and the few people – along with a now friendly cyborg in Arnold Schwarzenegger’s most unforgettable performance – who stand in the way. Among its many, many credits, including a truly badass turn from Linda Hamilton as a stronger and more resilient Sarah Connor – the second “Terminator” also marked a massive leap forward for CGI effects, helping to lay the groundwork for “Jurassic Park” and beyond.After a bold new beginning in 2011’s “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” this sequel raised the stakes in this rebooted franchise that finally had the incredible special effects to back up an idea first planted with the 1968 original. Featuring Andy Serkis in top form as ape leader Caesar, “Dawn” builds to an explosive crescendo anchored by chilling post-apocalyptic visions and real emotion, as viewers are confronted with the true nature of what it means to be human. A fourth entry to the series, “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” is out this summer.In the post-apocalyptic space, it doesn’t get any more bonkers than the world of Mad Max, which has seen several sequels reinvent and build upon what came before in truly eye-popping fashion. Franchise mastermind George Miller’s second entry “The Road Warrior” took the ingredients from his gritty first outing and crystallized them into a superb sequel, while the third installment remains memorable if for no other reason than Tina Turner’s unbelievable appearance as the menacing Auntie Entity. Thirty years later, the Tom Hardy- and Charlize Theron-led reboot “Fury Road” showed just how many new mind-bending possibilities there were for this world. Miller is at work on not one but two new installments, including an origin story for Theron’s Furiosa starring Anya Taylor-Joy.While this franchise borders on both the supernatural and comedy genres, it deserves a place on this list for being an inventive and under-appreciated sequel that took the elements from the original “Ghostbusters” and ran with them. Giving more room for performers including Annie Potts, Rick Moranis, Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver to play – not to mention a truly madcap performance from Peter MacNicol as an outlandish museum employee-turned-possessed demon, sometimes in drag – “Ghostbusters II” still brings the chills as well as the fun, giving new meaning to the idea of “feel-good music” thanks to the prominent placement of “(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher” as sung by Howard Huntsberry.Truly and deservedly the “father” of all sequels, “Empire” blew the spaceship door off the “Star Wars ” franchise and is most likely the reason it has not only lasted this long, but become a perennial element in pop culture the world over. Its blueprint for deepening the story and expanding the characters has been followed – but never bested – by many a sequel since, including “Dune: Part Two” (the source material of which, it must be said, served as a heavy influence for George Lucas when he was first conceiving his “Star Wars” universe). If for no other reason, the decision to end “Empire” on not only a cliffhanger, but a down note at that, is a daring move few franchises have ever attempted, “Dune” among them.“Dune: Part Two” is produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, which, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery."

        "text": "The trailer for the highly anticipated “Wicked” two-part movie musical event made its debut on Sunday, with the film’s first look airing during the Super Bowl LVIII.The movie’s stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo are featured as Glinda and Elphaba, respectively, in the trailer as Erivo can be heard singing her chilling rendition of the ballad “Defying Gravity.”“Something just takes over me,” Erivo’s Elphaba is seen saying in the clip. “And when it does, bad things happen.”The trailer is a kaleidoscope of color as audiences get their first introduction into director Jon M. Chu’s world of Oz, with massive fields of flowing flowers, the Emerald City and fantastical landscapes showcased throughout.In the trailer, Grande’s Glinda tells Elphaba to not be afraid.“It’s the Wizard who should be afraid of me,” Elphaba stoically says in reply.The two-part “Wicked” movie is a cinematic adaptation of the famed Broadway musical, which is a prequel to “The Wizard of Oz.” It tells an alternate version of events in Oz before Dorothy’s arrival and explores the story of how Elphaba becomes the Wicked Witch of the West as she navigates being framed by the Wizard.According to the theater news website Broadway World, “Wicked” is one of the most commercially successful musicals of all time, making $14.8 million at the Broadway box office last year alone.Jeff Goldblum, Oscar-winner Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Bailey and Bowen Yang also star in the film.“Wicked: Part 1” will hit theaters on November 27. “Wicked: Part 2” will follow in late 2025."

        "title": "‘Ricky Stanicky’ gives John Cena and Zac Efron a chance to flex their comedy muscles",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Playfully letting John Cena flex his comedy muscles, “Ricky Stanicky” works from an amusing premise that owes an unlikely debt to a 51-year-old “MASH” episode, in which an imaginary character must be brought to life. Also serving as a reunion of Zac Efron and director Peter Farrelly, the execution yields an only fitfully funny R-rated comedy, a genre that’s found a receptive platform via Amazon.Like seemingly all friendship-based comedies, this one begins with a flashback, as a trio of boys get into trouble and desperately blame what happened on “Ricky Stanicky,” a made-up kid.Jump to the present day, and Dean (Efron) along with his pals JT (“Dave’s” Andrew Santino) and Wes (Jermaine Fowler) are still invoking the name – in much the way “MASH’s” Hawkeye did with “Captain Tuttle” – although here, mostly to get away for guys weekends or escape situations they’d rather avoid, such as a baby shower. Feeling smug about the ruse, they wryly toast Stanicky as “The best friend we never had.”As it happens, their latest juvenile escapade takes them to Atlantic City, where they meet an odd lounge-entertainer type who goes by the name “Rock Hard” Rod (Cena), right before the ruse blows up in their faces. Forced to produce Stanicky after using him as their excuse, Dean has the bright idea of hiring Rod to portray Stanicky at a bris for JT’s baby.Not surprisingly given the film’s below-the-belt bent, a circumcision gag follows, while Rod has to vamp his way through all the fabulous attributes the trio have ascribed to Stanicky through the years.Although Rod has dutifully studied the “bible” they’ve assembled, that sets up plenty of highly awkward moments to keep misleading both their romantic partners and Dean and JT’s boss (William H. Macy, getting into the silly spirit).After winning a much-debated Oscar with “Green Book,” Farrelly collaborated with Efron on another streaming movie, 2022’s “The Greatest Beer Run Ever.” “Ricky Stanicky” shifts closer to the sort of raunchy comedic fare for which Farrelly was known when working with brother Bobby on movies like “There’s Something About Mary.”Usually crediting a script to six writers (Farrelly being one of them) isn’t a particularly good sign – and the film does have a sitcom-writers-room feel about it – yet there are some reasonably good laughs peppered throughout, as well as a darker, more serious side about Dean’s difficult childhood that feels too incongruous with the movie’s overall tone.While edgier comedies have found the sledding fairly difficult at the box office of late (“Anyone But You” being a notable exception), Amazon has exhibited a fondness for the genre, including the recent Snoop Dogg vehicle “The Underdoggs.”Like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cena has smartly taken advantage of his tough-guy physique to carve a path into broad comedy, from the DC series “Peacemaker” to “Blockers,” “Trainwreck” and “Playing with Fire.” “Ricky Stanicky” might be imaginary and doesn’t measure up to its promise, but in terms of that basket within the wrestler-turned-actor’s filmography, it at least fits Cena like a glove.“Ricky Stanicky” premieres March 7 on Amazon’s Prime Video. It’s rated R."

        "title": "‘Elsbeth’ turns Carrie Preston’s ‘The Good Wife’ role into a breezy good time",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "After fighting “The Good Fight” for streaming, the producers of “The Good Wife” indulge in a more CBS-friendly spinoff with “Elsbeth,” which breezily takes Carrie Preston’s quirky title character and turns her into a modern version of “Columbo.” About all that’s missing is the latter’s “Oh, one thing” method of springing the final trap.The pilot sets up Elsbeth Tascioni’s fast-talking attorney by relocating her from Chicago to New York, where she’s positively giddy about everything associated with the Big Apple, from the Statue of Liberty to the theater. The reason for said move involves having her become the appointed liaison to oversee the police because of a consent decree related to what she diplomatically describes as “some teeny corruption problems.”Of course, the NYPD and its captain (Wendell Pierce, somewhat underemployed) aren’t thrilled about having Elsbeth around, and he assigns a quiet officer (Carra Patterson) to keep an eye on her. Still, Elsbeth’s mandate provides her with the opportunity to wade into investigations, and she does so with a disarming style that causes everyone to underestimate her.Created by Robert and Michelle King, there’s a teeny serialized aspect to the premise, but really not much that departs from the classic murder-of-the-week format. The series also employs the old device of identifying the killer in the early moments, putting the audience a step ahead of everyone except perhaps Elsbeth, who has a knack for zeroing in on the smallest of clues.The episodes previewed include Stephen Moyer, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Jane Krakowski as guest stars, with Ferguson portraying the producer of a very Bravo-like reality show called “Lavish Ladies,” where one of the regulars winds up dead.Preston received a guest-star Emmy for the role back in 2013, so the stand-alone series represents a long-delayed effort to wring extra mileage from “The Good Wife’s” legacy while hewing to the kind of comfort-food formula that still works reasonably well for the traditional networks – an appetite CBS has recently fed with its other new procedural drama, “Tracker.”Granted, there’s not a whole lot about that approach to prompt wild enthusiasm, but to those looking for a modest diversion, Preston is good company, and the writing is intermittently clever. Besides, the irrepressible Elsbeth has enough enthusiasm for all of us.“Elsbeth” premieres February 29 at 10 p.m. ET on CBS."

        "title": "Kristen Stewart talks ‘Love Lies Bleeding,’ being an ‘annoying’ actor, and why not every director is up to the job",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Getting a movie off the ground is hard. Just ask Kristen Stewart.Her directorial debut, “The Chronology of Water,” has been stuck in development hell, struggling to find financing – to the point she took a stand in January, telling Variety she would not make another movie before she had made hers.While the industry weighs this threat, audiences can enjoy Stewart’s upcoming performances in “Love Me” and “Love Lies Bleeding” – two very different stories in which Stewart’s characters fall head over heels and makes questionable choices to keep romances alive.The latter, a pulpy slice of Americana written and directed by Brit Rose Glass, enters theaters in the US this month and sees Stewart take on the role of Lou, a gym manager smitten with aspiring bodybuilder Jackie (Katy M. O’Brian). The pair’s love affair is threatened when they become mixed up in Lou’s crime family, headed by a grizzled Ed Harris, who runs their small town in 1980s New Mexico.The thriller – think “Bonnie and Clyde” by way of the Coen Brothers ­­– is both a throwback and a piece of forward-looking, muscular filmmaking; a queer love story with dirt under its fingernails that pulses with violent intent. As well as another showcase for Stewart, the actor told CNN there were plenty of takeaways from working with Glass. “What did I learn from this?” she pondered. “Not everyone should keep (directing). She should.”Stewart knows of what she speaks. A former child star who successfully led a mega-franchise before pivoting to auteur fare (and the odd blockbuster), Stewart has experience to burn and more than a few war stories from life in the trenches of modern-day moviemaking. She’s worked with David Cronenberg, Pablo Larraín, Olivier Assayas, Woody Allen and Kelly Reichardt, earned an Oscar nomination and won a César, the French equivalent ­­– the first American actor to do so.Glass was coming off her hit debut “Saint Maud” and only ever had Stewart in mind for Lou. “(‘Love Lies Bleeding’) was quite a big leap up in scale,” the director told CNN in a joint interview with Stewart and O’Brian, “but I was met with a lot of encouragement, particularly for the more bonkers aspects of it.”Her screenplay marries pitch black humor and sexual abandon with occasional gore and phantasmagoria, in a plot partly driven by the effect of steroids taken by O’Brian’s bodybuilder. Stewart herself was all in for the shoot in Albuquerque in the summer of 2022. “I trust her choices, instincts, opinions, taste – all of it,” she said.“I felt fully in her hands,” said Stewart. “I don’t always feel that way with directors. I think as an actor I’m becoming really annoying. I don’t trust everyone. So it was fun to fully trust fall with her.”“There’s this delicacy and this open communication thing, that is really nice to see, that is ­– and not to be too binary about it – but is quite female,” she elaborated. “And it was just fun to see her run such a wild experience … very much in control of something that was also out of control.”Her relationship with Glass is one she hopes to emulate herself one day.“If I were to take anything from this (film), I would say find people who really like you. You need to find people that really want to be able to give (themselves) up … your thoughts, your body,” she explained.“I wanted to give her everything so she could just take it and do exactly what she wanted to do, and it then had nothing to do with what I wanted to do,” Stewart explained. “But somehow those instincts get married and a movie happens. And I just want to be on the other side of that.”One thing her crew shouldn’t expect if and when Stewart finds herself in the hot seat is much downtime. The conversation moves towards O’Brian comparing her experiences in the New Mexico desert with Marvel and Disney productions (the actor has had supporting roles in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” and “The Mandalorian”).“We have so much more time on a Marvel set,” said O’Brian, “you just…”“…expire,” Stewart interjected.“It’s more laid back,” O’Brian offered.“It’s boring,” her co-star replied.Stewart doesn’t like to be kept waiting. Film industry, take note.“Love Lies Bleeding” opens in select US cinemas on March 8 before going wide on March 15, and is released in the UK on May 3."

Because the worst place for it to live is my mind, and then I’m like Ryan Gosling in ‘The Notebook’ building a house for this person. I would rather say it and see what happens and then wake up the next day and find out that it’s been heavily documented.”She continued, adding of her reunion with Mendes, “I opted for that route.”“It is what it is. It was a great route, it was a fun time. It was a fun moment,” Cabello added.She also explained why they called it off after the second try, saying that it just didn’t feel right.“You’re just kind of like, it’s not a fit, it doesn’t feel right,” she said. “And I think, luckily, I was in a place in my life where it took me less time to realize that. It took us both less time to be like, ‘This doesn’t feel right and we don’t need to try so hard to make it work. It’s all good.’”But Cabello said she has nothing but love for her ex.“I will always care about him and love him. He’s such a good person and I’m lucky because some people have exes that are awful, and he is not,” she said. “He’s a really kind, good person.”"

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the “Rust” film armorer, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter Wednesday in a New Mexico trial stemming from the 2021 on-set fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was killed by a live round of ammunition fired from a prop gun that was held by actor Alec Baldwin.Gutierrez Reed, who was responsible for firearm safety and storage on the movie’s set, was acquitted of a separate charge of evidence tampering, which was brought after prosecutors alleged she transferred a “small bag of cocaine” to someone else after a police interview on the day of the shooting on October 21, 2021.Jurors deliberated for nearly three hours Wednesday before reaching a decision. The 26-year-old, who did not take the stand in her defense during the trial in Santa Fe, did not show any emotion while the verdict was read. She was then taken into custody.The involuntary manslaughter charge carries up to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine. The judge did not set a sentencing date.Gutierrez Reed is the first person to stand trial in a case that highlighted the movie industry’s safety standards – and this specific set’s violations of them.Attorneys representing Hutchins’ parents and sister were satisfied with the jury’s verdict, the attorneys said in a release.“We look forward to the justice system continuing to make sure that everyone else who is responsible for Halyna’s death is required to face the legal consequences for their actions,” the release reads.Prosecutors argued Gutierrez Reed repeatedly violated safety protocol on set and acted negligently and without caution in performing her duties as armorer, and that her actions ultimately led to Hutchins’ death.“This is not a case where Hannah Gutierrez made one mistake and that one mistake was accidentally putting a live round into that gun. That’s not what this case is about,” special prosecutor Kari Morrissey said during closing arguments Wednesday.“This case is about constant, never-ending safety failures that resulted in the death of a human being and nearly killed another,” she added. The film’s director also was injured in the shooting.Gutierrez Reed’s defense attorney Jason Bowles, who has called the shooting a tragic accident, said in closing arguments the armorer could not have known Baldwin would point the weapon toward the cinematographer. And film set management was to blame for safety failures, he said.Bowles’ team plans to appeal the verdict, the attorney told CNN in an email. CNN has also sought comment on the verdict from prosecutors.Baldwin had been practicing for a scene and was drawing and pointing a revolver with guidance from Hutchins and Joel Souza, the film’s director, according to a probable cause statement filed in January 2023. Souza also was shot but survived.The prosecution argued Gutierrez Reed’s failures allowed six live rounds to make their way onto the set, and that she did not conduct vital safety checks of the gun and ammunition that would have caught the live rounds.“She had six, six live rounds on that movie set, the earliest date that I can track them for you is October 10, (2021),” Morrissey said during Wednesday’s closing arguments. “Six, and she failed to ferret them out for 12 days. What that means is that she wasn’t shaking any dummy rounds, she wasn’t testing anything.”“If she’s not checking the dummy ammunition during the pendency of the filming to make sure that those rounds that are designed to look like live rounds are in fact dummy rounds, this was a game of Russian roulette every time an actor had a gun with dummies.”Bowles, Gutierrez Reed’s attorney, instead argued in the trial that the blame lies elsewhere and said his client was being used as a scapegoat.He questioned how the live ammunition made it on set and alleged the “Rust” production team created a chaotic and unsafe environment that put Gutierrez Reed under “really tough conditions to keep up with.” And Baldwin did not follow common-sense gun safety rules on set when he handled the firearm and acted unpredictably when he pointed the weapon at Hutchins, Bowles said in his closing statements.“(Gutierrez Reed) could not anticipate what Baldwin would do. It was not in the script, it was not foreseeable,” he said. “Management was responsible for safety failures and not Hannah.”Bowles also pushed back against the evidence tampering charge, saying a witness had assumed there was cocaine in a small bag Gutierrez Reed handed her on the day of the shooting, but that she quickly threw the bag away and the substance was never tested or confirmed to be the drug.Baldwin, who has also been charged with involuntary manslaughter, is expected to stand trial in July. He has pleaded not guilty and has maintained he did not pull the trigger.A government report published roughly six months after the shooting said the movie set “willfully violated” safety rules and “demonstrated plain indifference to employee safety.” Rust Movie Productions, LLC was fined for its actions, CNN has reported.Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses during the trial – including movie crew members, law enforcement officials and forensics experts – and watched videos of body camera footage from the day of the shooting.In one of those clips, Gutierrez Reed told a Santa Fe County sheriff’s corporal there was never live ammunition kept on set and that she had checked the prop guns and the “dummy” rounds the morning before the shooting. Gutierrez Reed told the same officer she checks dummy rounds on set “most of the time.”“Dummy” rounds refer to ammunition that contains no explosive elements but resemble actual bullets.Assistant film director David Halls admitted during the trial he was “negligent” in checking the gun and did not properly look through all the rounds in the gun’s chamber when Gutierrez Reed presented it to him.“She opened up the latch to the revolver, I recall seeing three to four, what I believed to be dummy rounds,” Halls testified. He later added: “I don’t recall her fully rotating the cylinder.”Halls yelled “cold gun” before the weapon was handed to Baldwin, a remark meant to indicate the firearm did not have live rounds, according to a court document. Halls took a plea deal in 2023 for his role in the shooting, pleading no contest to one count of negligent use of a deadly weapon.“I was negligent in checking the gun properly,” Halls told the court.Halls was sentenced to six months of unsupervised probation, a $500 fine, had to participate in a firearms safety class, complete 24 hours of community service and not use drugs or alcohol.In her closing arguments, Morrissey said there was no evidence someone else was to blame for the shooting, adding Gutierrez Reed was “the autonomous decisionmaker with regard to gun safety” on set.“Alec Baldwin’s conduct and his lack of gun safety … on that day is something that he’s going to have to answer for. Not with you and not today,” the prosecutor told jurors Wednesday. “That will be with another jury, on another day.”"

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "The story behind “The Gentlemen” might be more interesting than the show, with director Guy Ritchie rebooting his 2020 movie as an eight-episode Netflix series. Yet despite the dashing presence of Theo James as the unexpected heir to a cannabis empire, the net result blows by briskly enough but yields relatively few highs.James’ Eddie returns from military service in the British army to discover that his late father, the Duke of Halstead, has left him the family’s sprawling “Downton Abbey”-sized estate, bypassing his understandably gobsmacked older brother, Freddy (Daniel Ings). The real surprise, though, comes when Eddie discovers that the property has become home to a criminal enterprise, forcing Eddie to deal with those behind it, his main contact being Susie (Kaya Scodelario), the ice-cold daughter of the reigning boss (Ray Winstone).Lots of hair-trigger situations, violence and frantic negotiations ensue, as Eddie labors to compensate for his brother’s stupidity while trying to extricate the family from its ties to an assortment of nefarious and eccentric characters, leading to darkly comic encounters that give the show a decidedly episodic feel.Despite Ritchie’s trademark visual style (seen in “The Wrath of Man” and the Robert Downey Jr.-starring Sherlock Holmes movies), which coincides with lots of crank-up-the-volume music, there’s not much to distinguish the show from a host of others where ordinary folk find themselves thrust into a criminal milieu, sometimes discovering reservoirs of grit and sides of their personalities they barely recognize.Still, similar concepts like “Breaking Bad” and “Ozark” have set a high bar, which might help explain the “meh” verdict. That’s despite a nice starring turn by James – much better served here than he was in “The Time Traveler’s Wife” – and a lot of classy talent on the fringes: Giancarlo Esposito (playing a character not far removed from his “Breaking Bad” role) as a drug lord with an interest in Eddie’s estate; Vinnie Jones as Halstead Manor’s gamekeeper; and Joely Richardson as Eddie’s mother, who is rather deliciously unflustered by all these dirty doings.Indeed, part of the fun in these scenarios involves the gradual transformations and strange connections that occur when, to quote “The Gentlemen’s” ad line, “Old money meets drug money.”In this show, though, it’s really more a case of an old idea meeting new packaging, with the added allure of attaching a director with a strong (if somewhat uneven) creative pedigree and vision.Ritchie clearly appears to have had fun expanding upon the concept of his earlier film, which starred Matthew McConaughey. Whether the new mixture of talent and tone provides enough rationale for Netflix to invest its relatively new money is debatable for a show whose appeal, beyond the general atmosphere, mostly boils down to smoke and mirrors.“The Gentlemen” premieres March 7 on Netflix."

I have a titanium hip. I mean, the list goes on and on, but nothing can stop me.”Madonna, who has spoken about her recovery at times during previous tour performances, described her medical scare as a “near-death experience.”“I’m not kidding. It was pretty scary. Obviously, I didn’t know for four days, because I was in an induced coma. But when I woke up, the first word I said was ‘No.’ Anyway, that’s what my assistant tells me.”She added, “I’m pretty sure that God was saying to me, ‘Do you wanna come with us? You wanna come with me? You wanna go this way?’ And I said, ‘No. No. No!”She called Dr. Agus “a very special man in the audience tonight.”“He’s put up with so many entertaining phone calls from me. When I was sick this summer and I literally couldn’t walk from my bed to the toilet, I would call him every other day and ask him why I didn’t have any energy,” she said. “When was my energy gonna come back? When was I gonna feel myself again? When could I go back on tour again? When, when, when, when, when, when, when? And all he would say was, ‘Go outside in the sun.’”When she replied that her pristine skin was a result of staying out of the sun, Dr. Agus explained, “Go outside in the sun. You need vitamin D so your kidneys will keep working.”“And I hate the sun, but I did it anyways, and it was so hard for me to walk from my house to the backyard and sit in the sun,” Madonna said. “I know that sounds insane, but it was difficult, and I didn’t know when I could get up again and when I could be myself again and when I would have my energy back. It was a strange thing to finally not feel like I was in control. And that was my lesson to let go.”She concluded with a thanks to “everyone who’s here that took care of me and listened to all of my endless complaining and need for predictions that I could not have. You are patient and you are kind, and you still are. You still help me take care of everybody I know that’s sick. Thank you so much, wherever you are.”And finally with a thanks to her children, who “really helped me pull through, because they worked so hard and… I didn’t want to let them down.”"

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "If David Lynch’s 1984 “Dune” movie raced through the book, the second half of director Denis Villeneuve’s version at times moves as if it’s walking in sand, figuratively as well as literally. Still visually dazzling and overwhelming in its scale, “Dune: Part Two” becomes enmeshed in the political denseness of author Frank Herbert’s world, unevenly marching through this part of the story before rather abruptly coming to an end.Much has changed since the first movie was simultaneously released in theaters and via streaming during the height of the pandemic (a decision the director sharply criticized), and the reloaded cast remains plenty starry, including a meatier role for Zendaya in this chapter.The technical wizardry, which earned the 2021 film six Oscars, certainly lends itself to big-screen consumption, and Warner Bros. (like CNN, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery) should cash in more handsomely this time around.Still, if the first film meticulously set up the pieces and players, the latest movie shifts into what amounts to an extended origin story for Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as he lives among the Fremen, learns to ride giant worms and gradually embraces his destiny as the warrior messiah they call Mahdi.To do that – and gain the vengeance he seeks – Paul must first be accepted by the Fremen in their guerrilla war against the invading Harkonnens, led by the bloated Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) and his repulsive nephews, the Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) and Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler, having happily shed his “Elvis” vocal affectation, as well as his eyebrows).Like Sting before him, Butler makes the most of his role as a sneering psychopath whose ruthlessness prompts the Baron to unleash him upon the Fremen, hoping to ensure the uninterrupted flow of spice, the galaxy’s most precious resource. Other new players include Christopher Walken and Florence Pugh as the emperor and his daughter, Léa Seydoux, and briefly, Anya Taylor-Joy.With composer Hans Zimmer’s muscular score (and the overall sound) working overtime, Villeneuve is at his best when depicting the fascistic power of the Harkonnens and their sprawling military machine. At the same time, the pacing proves more halting, particularly in the first hour or so of this 166-minute spectacle, which plunges deeply into the intricacies of imperial politics and Fremen customs, punctuated by skirmishes in the larger war.That languid opening stretch comes back to haunt the movie toward the end, when it feels as if Villeneuve (who shares screenplay credit with Jon Spaihts) is rushing toward a climax that again sends the message – or the hope – that this might not be the last we’ll see of “Dune.” There’s also a questionable decision in having Paul’s witchy mom, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), communicating with her unborn daughter who “speaks” to her from the womb.A true Warner Bros. MVP between this and “Wonka,” Chalamet credibly shoulders the weight of a character maturing from callow youth into commanding savior, but those playing the villains frankly appear to be having a lot more fun, except possibly Javier Bardem as Stilgar, whose faith makes him Paul’s biggest Fremen fan.From a more earthbound perspective, after a delay due to Hollywood’s twin strikes, the “Dune” sequel has emerged as the latest ray of hope in Hollywood’s often-frustrating crusade to entice people back into theater seats, nearing the end of a discontented winter that has produced few bright spots.Like “Dune’s” first half and the “Avatar” movies, “Part Two” possesses state-of-the-art cinematic qualities that reward soaking in its grandeur, at least for anyone who hasn’t entirely lost the moviegoing habit. After the initial promise, though, the film only sporadically rises to the level of its sky-high expectations – a somewhat ironic sign of how quickly the worm can turn.“Dune” premieres March 1 in US theaters. It’s rated PG-13."

        "text": "A new animated special puts a spotlight on Franklin Armstrong, the first Black character in the Peanuts comic strip, more than 50 years after he made his debut.The Apple TV+ special “Snoopy Presents: Welcome Home, Franklin” explores the character’s origin as a young boy from a military family who likes baseball, space and listening to Stevie Wonder, we come to learn.“A Franklin special is really overdue,” Craig Schulz, who co-wrote the special and is the son of Peanuts creator Charles Schulz, told NPR. “We get to go back and really find out where Franklin came from and really tell the whole story of this kid.”Franklin first appeared in a Peanuts comic in the summer of 1968, after Los Angeles school teacher Harriet Glickman wrote to Charles Schulz and urged him to integrate his comics. According to correspondence shared by the Schulz museum, Glickman believed Peanuts comics could help shape attitudes about race in America after the death of Martin Luther King Jr.In Franklin’s comic debut, he and Charlie Brown were shown playing on the beach together during a time when many beaches were still segregated. The new special nods to that scene and others in Franklin’s history.“Franklin is a culturally significant character, and he means a lot of things to different people,” the special’s director Raymond Persi told Animation Magazine. “It was important to include ideas that came up in discussions with my crew in a way that felt organic and served the story.”Franklin at first struggles to make friends with the Peanuts kids as the new kid in town, but over the course of the special he connects with Charlie Brown through a soap box derby.“We don’t always know what other people are going through, but what we do know is everyone is trying to connect and find friendship in this world,” Persi said.“Snoopy Presents: Welcome Home, Franklin” is currently streaming on Apple TV+."

        "text": "The 96th Academy Awards will take place on Sunday and while the gowns and the guests will be beautiful, we’ll be watching to get in our feelings with moving acceptance speeches.Honestly, the crazier or more emotional, the better.Let’s look back at some of the more unforgettable Oscars speeches from ceremonies in recent decades.When director and actor Roberto Benigni won the Oscar for best foreign language film in 1999, he jumped up, walked over neighboring chairs, clutched Steven Spielberg’s hand along his path, then, quite literally, bounced his way to the stage to yell, “This is a moment of joyl!”Rewatching video of the moment is an instant mood boostLeonardo DiCaprio won an Oscar in 2016 for his performance as lead actor in “The Revenant.” DiCaprio used his moment in the spotlight to urge people to work together to address the threat of climate change.“I thank you all for this amazing award tonight,” DiCaprio said. “Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted.”There were few dry eyes in the audience when Nyong’o won for her performance in the drama “12 Years a Slave.” Her poignant speech concluded with a powerful message.“When I look down at this golden statue, may it remind me and every little child that no matter where you are from, your dreams are valid,” she said.In 2023, Michelle Yeoh became the first Asian woman to win the Oscar for best actress in a leading role for her performance in “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”Taking the stage, Yeoh, then 60, proudly said, “This is proof that dream big and dreams do come true, and ladies, don’t let anybody tell you you’re past your prime.”Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were newbies to the movie industry when they won an Oscar for writing “Good Will Hunting.” With youthful exuberance, the Boston besties tried to beat the clock, rapidly shouting out the city of Boston and multiple names on their thank you list, including to their moms, who they took as dates to the ceremony.This was a moment and Berry more than met it in her moving acceptance speech in 2002, when she became the first Black woman to win the Oscar for best lead actress. Accepting her award in tears, Berry acknowledged the historic significance of her win.“This moment is so much bigger than me. This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll,” Berry said. “It’s for every faceless, nameless, woman of color who now has the chance because this door tonight has been opened.”When Williams won the Academy Award for supporting actor for his performance in “Good Will Hunting,” the brilliant late comedian joked he was at a rare loss for words.“Ah, man! This might be the one time I’m speechless,” Robins said, before going on to acknowledge the aforementioned Affleck and Damon, teasing, “Thank you, Ben and Matt. I still want to see some ID.”His speech, perfectly timed and infused with heart and humor, concluded with a great line.“I want to thank my father, up there, the man who when I said I wanted to be an actor, he said, “Wonderful, just have a back-up profession like welding,” Williams recalled. “Thank you. God bless you.”"

        "text": "Actress Helen Mirren has said she is “blown away” by a new Barbie created in her likeness.The glamorous doll, complete with its own Academy Award, is one of a series of eight launched by toymaker Mattel to mark International Women’s Day on Friday.Despite holding the Oscar - which Mirren won for her role in the 2006 movie “The Queen” - the doll is wearing the blue dress and dyed blue hair that the actress modeled on the red carpet at last year’s Cannes Film Festival.Mirren, the 78-year-old star who narrated last year’s hit “Barbie” movie, said she regards the creation of the doll as a “huge compliment.”In a statement posted on her website, the star, whose other movies include “Elizabeth I,” “Gosford Park” and “Golda,” said: “I am absolutely blown away by my Barbie. To be chosen by Barbie as a Role Model is a huge compliment, and something I would never have imagined in my wildest dreams happening to me at this stage in my life.“It’s a very special thing, and something I can add to my list of my favourite achievements; becoming a Dame of the British Empire, having an Oscar, having a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame – and having my own Barbie!”Of the doll’s dramatic outfit - emulating the cornflower-blue gown by Del Core that she wore at Cannes - Mirren said: “The intricacy and detail of the doll is extraordinary; I love that the Barbie doll is wearing one of my favourite ever red carpet looks, and it was the first time I’d ever had blue hair, and it felt so exciting. I like to embrace theatrical fashion and the joy that having fun with fashion can bring, and I think that this joy should be age-less. And the cherry on top of the cake is my doll having a miniature Oscar. It is an absolutely perfect reproduction.”Mirren’s doll was one of a series of “one of a kind role model dolls” launched by Mattel to celebrate Barbie’s 65th anniversary. Among the others are singers Kylie Minogue and Shania Twain and actress Viola Davis. Also celebrated with their own dolls are Brazil’s Maira Gomez, a content creator from the indigenous Tatuyo community; Mexican director, producer and screenwriter Lila Avilés; Japanese model Nicole Fujita and German comedian Enissa Amani.Tweeting pictures of herself with her likeness, Minogue wrote: “Baby Kylie would NOT believe this is happening right now …. Thank you @barbie @barbiestyle @Mattel”Previous role model dolls have included TV producer Shonda Rhimes, professional skateboarder Sky Brown and Sarah Gilbert, who developed the Covid-19 vaccine.Commenting on the launch of the new dolls on Mattel’s website, Krista Berger, Senior Vice President of Barbie and Global Head of Dolls, said: “Barbie’s story has never been just about her. It’s about the countless young kids she’s inspired and the millions of stories she helped them imagine along the way.“For the past 65 years, Barbie has used her global platform to empower girls to dream big, explore their limitless potential, and direct their own narrative to shape their future. As we celebrate this milestone anniversary, we recognize over six decades of stories Barbie has helped write and the doll that continues to give everyone the opportunity to dream – and dream big.”"

        "text": "Event producer Trell Thomas is a big fan of Sunday dinners in the Black community.The warmth, the togetherness, and, of course, the delicious dishes speak to his soul and remind him of growing up in South Carolina.“You go to church and after church you have Sunday dinner around like one or two o’clock, if you’re lucky. I grew up Southern Baptist and sometimes it was three or four,” Trell recalled in a recent interview with CNN. “My mom hosted at our home every Sunday, and it was one of the first places where I got to see and feel the joy of being a Black person.”Thomas, who formerly worked in broadcast journalism, has turned his nostalgia into a thriving business that is attracting everyone from influencers and celebrities to those just looking to connect.The Black Excellence Brunch grew out of Thomas’ apartment and is now a sought after ticket – even internationally.A quick perusal of his social media shows events featuring Kelly Rowland, Niecy Nash and the cast of the movie musical “The Color Purple.”It’s a heady achievement for a man who says he can’t even cook. Trell credits his move from New York City to Los Angeles in 2017 for getting him in the business.“We went to this like beautiful rooftop restaurant in New York City and I asked everybody to wear all white because I was like, ‘I can ask them to go the extra mile since it’s going away,’” he explained. “And everybody came looking beautiful.”Trell said people in the restaurant immediately started asking, “Who are you? What do you do? Can I take a picture?” and wanting to send over food and drinks to his group.“I just remember looking around the table and seeing people like sit up a little bit taller, smile a little bit brighter, laugh a little bit louder and I thought to myself, if I could just give us this feeling all the time,” Thomas explained. “Fast forward, I moved to LA, did the same thing, same vibe, same reaction. And I just thought to myself, there’s something beautiful here.”That beauty didn’t stop because of the pandemic. Thomas simply switched to virtual gatherings and learned that the magic was in forming community, even if it couldn’t be in person.Inviting Black artists and celebrities to join the gatherings just made sense to Thomas, who has begun expanding his events overseas. After all, the brunches are all about joy and those he has chosen to honor, including actors like Sheryl Lee Ralph, Tabitha Brown and David Oyelowo have brought just that to their audiences.“We give them their flowers,” Thomas said, smiling."

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Despite offering Kingsley Ben-Adir the breakout role that has clearly awaited him, “Bob Marley: One Love” comes across too much as a licensed product, a family-blessed movie that avoids the detail (and potential rough edges) of an actual biopic to focus on one narrow slice of the reggae star’s too-brief life. It’s a dutiful addition to a recent wave of such biographies (see “Rocketman” and “Bohemian Rhapsody”), but a largely uninspired one.Part of that can be traced to “King Richard” director Reinaldo Marcus Green’s decision, as he told Yahoo, that based on his experience with that earlier movie, he “would not have made the film if they were not involved,” referencing Marley’s widow Rita and children Ziggy and Cecelia, all credited as producers.Such involvement, however, can be a double-edged sword, and in the case of “One Love,” at least, yields a movie that feels particularly thin and sanitized, picking up with tumult in Marley’s home of Jamaica, an assassination attempt on his life in 1976, and a move to Europe where he came up with his album “Exodus” and then toured to support it.Set primarily within that slender window, Green (who shares script credit with three other writers) deals with the biographical aspects through fleeting flashbacks, mostly involving Marley’s courtship of his wife Rita (Lashana Lynch), who, in the present-tense portion of the film, too often is left sporting a pained expression as evidence of marital strain, while only glancingly addressing its origins.Leaning into Marley’s accent and mannerisms, Ben-Adir (whose eclectic recent resume includes Marvel’s “Secret Invasion,” “Barbie,” and playing another icon, Malcolm X, in “One Night in Miami”) captures the singer’s magnetism and creativity, but the unerring nature of that portrait is somewhat hamstrung by the movie’s narrative structure.Similarly, there’s relatively little done to develop the supporting players, and other than one flash of temper, the movie presents a largely unblemished snapshot of Marley, especially compared to the warts-and-all excesses depicted in other biographical tales covering musical superstars.All that really leaves, then, is the music itself, and performance sequences meticulously replicated with Ben-Adir primarily lip-synching to Marley’s vocals.What “One Love” doesn’t do, ultimately, is provide enough material to distinguish the movie from the contours of an authorized biography or documentary. In that sense, the film pays tribute to Marley’s work but winds up hampered by a love for its subject that works against its ability to deliver major insights or rock-star-level drama.“Bob Marley: One Love” premieres February 14 in US theaters. It’s rated PG-13."

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Haunting first-look images of Bill Skarsgård and FKA Twigs in the upcoming remake of the 1994 noir thriller “The Crow” were released on Wednesday, bringing renewed focus and honor to the classic’s original star, the late Brandon Lee.“Brandon was an original voice and I think he will always be synonymous with The Crow,” director of this year’s “Crow” remake Rupert Sanders said in an interview with Vanity Fair on Wednesday. “I hope he’s proud of what we’ve done and how we’ve brought the story back again.”Lee, the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, originated the role of the vengeful Eric Draven in “The Crow,” the Alex Proyas-directed supernatural thriller based on the comic book series by James O’Barr. In March 1993, 28-year-old Lee was accidentally shot and killed by a jammed prop gun on the film’s set.“His soul is very much alive in this film,” Sanders said of Lee this week.The first-look photos released on Wednesday showcase Skarsgård’s version of Draven, with a punk haircut and methodically-placed tattoos from head to toe. His signature black makeup is an eerie reminder of Lee’s Draven. Singer FKA Twigs is also seen in the photos, playing Draven’s love interest Shelly.While the 1994 film has become something of a cult classic, Sanders’ version of the film is a modern reimagining and veers from O’Barr’s source material. Despite the differences, the “Snow White and the Huntsman” director told Vanity Fair that his take is still a tribute to the memory of Lee.“Obviously, it was a terrible tragedy,” Sanders said of the star’s untimely death, adding that “it’s definitely something that we’ve always had in mind through the making of the film.”Describing Lee’s original take on Draven as a performance that possessed “fragility and beauty,” Sanders said he thinks that Skarsgård – known for his chilling rendition of Pennywise the Clown in the “It” remakes – “feels like he is a successor to that.”Sanders’ “Crow” follows Eric Draven (Skarsgård) and his fiancée Shelly, who are brutally murdered when Shelly’s dark past catches up with them.“Given the chance to save his true love by sacrificing himself,” an official synopsis reads, “Eric sets out to seek merciless revenge on their killers, traversing the worlds of the living and the dead to put the wrong things right.”“The Crow” is set to premiere in theaters on June 7."

        "text": "Paul McCartney knows a thing or two about writing love songs. But the former Beatle has faced criticism from some who feel he’s perhaps written too many love songs, with some that skew “soppy.”“I think a lot of people who are cynical about it haven’t been lucky enough to feel it,” McCartney said on Tuesday’s episode of his iHeartPodcast “McCartney: A Life in Lyrics.”McCartney said he often wonders about “the critic who damns” his legacy of love songs, but also mentioned that “they come and go,” while the power of his music tends to outlive said naysayers anyway.Throughout the podcast episode, McCartney focused on how universal the feeling of love is as part of his impetus for writing so many songs about it. This of course includes his own experience of finding love, particularly with his late wife Linda McCartney.In his Wings era, he even wrote “Silly Love Songs,” an intentionally cheeky love song about… yes, writing love songs. The 1976 hit was his answer to those noisy critics at the time.“I was being accused of just writing silly love songs and was in danger of starting to buy into this idea that you should just be a bit tougher and a bit more worldly. But then I suddenly realized that’s exactly what love is. It’s worldly,” he said on the podcast.It’s also a topic that is “actually very deep and meaningful and the basis of most religions and most philosophy,” McCartney continued. It’s this thing, he added, “that people can feel for each other that makes life better if they can engage in it.”Unfazed by his critics, McCartney said on the episode that instead of outlawing writing love songs, he would just “get on with it, (and) get into it,” and never “be embarrassed because even though you can say this is a soppy subject, it actually is the opposite.”It’s hard to imagine a world in which McCartney really did buy into the message his critics were pushing. If he did, we would never have gotten “Maybe I’m Amazed” or “Got to Get You Into My Life” or “Eight Days a Week,” and so many more.And if he wants to use his platform to spread love in a world that can sometimes feel full of hate and sorrow, what’s wrong with that?

        "title": "‘Love on the Spectrum’ reveals the challenges of autism representation",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Editor’s Note: This article uses both person-first and identity-first language, in keeping with the latest conversations among autism communities and advocates.It’s rare to see autism portrayed in media, and rarer still to see representation for adults with autism. The Netflix reality show “Love on the Spectrum,” based on an Australian show with the same name, is arguably the most visible program where people can see what it’s like for real autistic adults to navigate the challenges of life and love.The show follows a group of adults with autism as they navigate the dating world, aided by a relationship coach and the input of their loved ones. Despite its generally warm reception, the show has also received criticism from within adult autism communities. Some see it as a kind, compassionate representation of the social challenges people with autism face. Others see any good faith representation as a step in the right direction, even if it’s incomplete.“‘Love on the Spectrum’ is kind, but unrepresentative,” reads a review of the first season posted on Spectrum, an autism news and research publication.In online forums, some adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have taken issue with production details: A violin plucks a childlike motif when people describe their special interests and hobbies. Descriptions from family and friends, though well meaning, sometimes carry the tone of one speaking about a child rather than a grown adult. Throughout their dating journey, advice the cast receives sometimes encourages a “normalcy” that is, frankly, unnatural to many people with autism.“While it’s nice to see representation, some of the ways they portray people’s behaviors and their likes and dislikes feels like they’re playing into stereotypes of autistic people as being weird or childlike when they’re not,” Krista Ferguson, a 42-year-old with ASD and a member of Reddit’s 342,000-member autism subreddit, told CNN.Rather than being a criticism of the show in particular, the reactions to “Love on the Spectrum” speak to deeper nuances within the autism community that often go unnoticed. They also reveal gaps in the way allistic (non-autistic) people understand the autistic mind; that “normal” is sometimes neither possible nor desired, and that love — and acceptance, and success — are not things to be gained at the expense of suppressing one’s true self.Cast members on “Love on the Spectrum” make it clear they want to find someone who loves them for them.For some, that means a partner who will participate in their special interests, whether it’s medieval history or a love of cosplay. One could practically hear swoons when animal lover Abbey Romeo, a Season 1 favorite who continued her dating journey in Season 2, joined her boyfriend David Isaacmen on a trip to Africa — an adventure he had planned especially for her. For others, it means a partner who supports specific sensitivities or displays patience and understanding in challenging situations.It’s not uncommon to see very matter-of-fact language as cast members clarify the particulars of their romantic expectations. “I hope you don’t think me blunt, but I kind of like you, and I was wondering if maybe you’d like to hold hands,” cast member Connor Tomlinson tells one of his partners during a speed date. Another cast member suggests to her date that they have a round of kissing practice on cupcakes before trying the real thing.Obviously, not every date works out, and “Love on the Spectrum” shows daters weighing their fears of being alone with their fears of settling for someone who’s not quite right. When cast member Steve Spitz started to get close to a woman he wasn’t sure about, he ended up cutting ties rather than ignoring discomfort in the name of love.“I learned that finding love isn’t an easy process,” Spitz told Netflix after Season 2 was released. “There’s so much more to finding love than just having similar interests. You have to be compatible, trusting, and fair to the other person.”Autism among adults is often hard to understand due to a lack of research and public awareness. The first US study of adults with autism wasn’t published until 2020. Despite its conclusion that an estimated 5.5 million US adults live with ASD, most high-profile autism research and advocacy revolves around children with autism and their parents. Fearing stigma and discrimination, many adults with autism keep their condition a secret. Even more adults may live with autism and not know it, or avoid a diagnosis.When autism is visible, whether it’s in our own social circles or on a TV show, the individual experience is never representative of the whole.“When we’re talking about a spectrum, there’s an infinite number of ways a person can be autistic, so there are also endless possibilities for how a person can be seen or portrayed,” said André Felipe de Medeiros, a neurodivergent podcaster and journalist from São Paulo, Brazil.In his limited viewing of “Love on the Spectrum,” Medeiros said he found a “good mix of people presenting different traits that can be found on the spectrum.” These traits can include different tolerances to social situations or stimuli, varied speech patterns and conversational habits, the presence of verbal or physical “stimming,” (self-regulating with repetitive motions or vocalizations) physical differences and the need for some kind of supportive care.He also recommended the scripted shows “Everything’s Gonna Be Okay” and “Atypical” as two examples where autism representation hit the mark.“On both shows, different characters on the spectrum had different traits, giving viewers a broader picture of what autism can be,” he told CNN.“Good autism representation comes from being open to understanding that the spectrum is incredibly vast and being honest about how the way an autistic person or character is being represented is only one of infinite possibilities.”On “Love on the Spectrum,” the focus for participants is mostly on social interactions — the infinite web of cues and clues that make dating hard for anyone, let alone people with differently-wired brains. That’s definitely part of it, but limiting the challenges of ASD to some double-black-diamond social gauntlet ignores larger experiences of autism.“Autism is so much more than social communication,” said Dr. Megan Anna Neff, a clinical psychologist and author of “Self-Care for Autistic People.” “We have very sensitive nervous systems. Part of that is how we take in sensory information and stressors, and there are a lot of things we do to accommodate that.”Neff says common “autistic” traits like adhering to routines and disliking unexpected change may manifest in a social way, but are really speaking to something different.“All of these things that are so-called symptoms of autism are really ways that we are adapting to our nervous system to be able to move through the world,” she said.Having to constantly regulate in a way that most people don’t can lead to other behaviors that are considered to be outside of the social norm, like seeking long periods of time alone. While some people might find this concerning, Neff said for many people with autism, it is a necessary form of self-care.One of the most frustrating things for autistic adults is the pressure to act “normal” — a pressure that, for better or worse, is reflected in shows like “Love on the Spectrum.” On the show, dating coaches gently instruct participants how to act in socially typical ways. That often means suppressing natural autistic tendencies like stimming and editing oneself in conversations to avoid, say, speaking too forcefully or talking at length about a special interest.The fact is, many people with autism already engage in some form of self-censorship. It’s called “masking,” and while it is a common way for autistic adults to fit into social situations, it’s also extremely draining and isolating.“When we mask, we suppress the urge to communicate authentically, or to soothe our bodies in ways that might look different to others,” said Neff. “So perhaps other people might feel more connected to me when I mask, but I’m going to feel less connected to them. It can facilitate small talk, but it doesn’t actually forge authentic connection.”Sometimes, Neff said, autistic people find masking necessary — but it’s also a privilege that many on the spectrum simply cannot access.That diversity of ability and comfort with suppressing natural behaviors makes media representation even more complicated. Some critics of shows like “Love on the Spectrum” say it doesn’t acknowledge a wide array of ASD experiences, which can include physical, verbal and intellectual differences. While Neff says she’d like to see more diversity of race, gender and sexuality in such programs, she says the experiences that do get portrayed are just as valid.“I think there’s some division happening in the autistic advocacy space among those who mask and those who don’t. There’s a temptation to see a show and be like, well, that doesn’t show me,” she said.“But for those who present in a more stereotypical way, who do mask and want to fit in, they might feel seen. So I think it’s always important to show the many ways we present. We need a kaleidoscope of representation.”"

        "title": "‘Kung Fu Panda 4’ kicks up enough laughs to justify bringing it out of hibernation",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Coming 16 years after the original movie and eight since the most recent sequel, “Kung Fu Panda 4” actually benefits from what feels like pent-up demand, coupled with “The Simpsons” effect that animated characters don’t grow older. Slick and briskly paced, the film incorporates its origins while conjuring enough laughs and fun to effectively deliver for parents and their cubs.One of DreamWorks’ most agreeable franchises peaked early with its story of the unlikely Po (voiced with the usual gusto by Jack Black) rising from humble roots to become the Dragon Warrior, while facing off against a truly excellent and formidable villain in Tai Lung (Ian McShane). The sequels were fine but proved less memorable.This time, Po is reaping the rewards of his exalted status – even using it as a marketing come-on to assist his adoptive dad and birth dad, Ping and Li (James Hong, now 95, and Bryan Cranston) – when, inevitably, a fresh threat arises: The Chameleon (Viola Davis), a shape-shifting sorceress with supervillain-worthy ambitions that endanger the Valley of Peace.Po also gets a surprising instruction from Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), telling him that he must identify and begin to groom a successor. Yet he’s not only reluctant to give up the job, but distracted by this latest challenge, especially after a fast-talking thief, Zhen (Awkwafina), offers to lead him to the Chameleon’s stronghold.Although the best gags, involving some adorable but violence-loving bunnies, have been playing on a loop in the teaser trailers, the film still manages to combine muscular action with a healthy dollop of comedy, much of it having to do with Po’s posse and his seemingly unquenchable appetite. The A-list voice cast really boosts the way the characters play off each other, with most of the key players back (including McShane), Davis sinking her teeth into the venomous baddie and Ke Huy Quan among the other additions.Granted, there’s only so much that can be done at this point with this kind of concept beyond recycling it, but director Mike Mitchell (“Trolls”) keeps the story moving even during the relatively flat exposition, and the chase sequences and fights have considerable energy and visual flair.As noted, part of that might just have to do with the adage that absence makes the heart grow fonder, or in this case, “Panda” fans hungrier. Given that, looking at the growing intervals between movies, people should have worked up an appetite for bringing “Kung Fu Panda 5” out of hibernation somewhere around 2036.“Kung Fu Panda 4” premieres March 8 in US theaters. It’s rated PG."

        "title": "Five-time Oscar nominee Annette Bening appreciates that folks are mad she’s never won. She’s OK, though",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Annette Bening is meeting the moment.The acclaimed actor is currently in the midst of her fifth campaign for an Oscar statuette, this time for her intense and very physical performance in “Nyad,” based on the life of legendary and determined swimmer Diana Nyad.Bening isn’t, however, considered the favorite to win this year. When asked during a recent interview with CNN about whether she’s as mad about that fact as some of her supporters are, she laughed heartily.“I appreciate your rage, I applaud your rage, I support your rage,” she said.She doesn’t, however, “live in rage,” she added.Bening maintains that when it comes to the entertainment business, “you have to have a sense of humor about it.”“One of the good things about this moment for me is that I can look back at 34 years ago when I first went to the Oscars and what that was like, and compare it to this time, so it does give me a certain perspective that allows me to just go with the flow,” she said. “I don’t really worry. I just am appreciative.”Bening is referring to her first Academy Award-nominated role in 1990’s “The Grifters,” the Stephen Frears-directed crime drama in which she starred opposite John Cusack and Anjelica Huston. It was one of her first film roles, but Bening stole the spotlight and was soon landing lead roles, like in “Bugsy” (opposite her future husband Warren Beatty) and “The American President.”Arguably Bening’s most iconic role came in 1999 and landed her a best lead actress Oscar nomination for playing the complex and uptight realtor Carolyn Burnham in “American Beauty.”Looking back on the role – which she played opposite Kevin Spacey in his second Oscar-winnning performance, as Carolyn’s tortured husband Lester – Bening mentioned the “duality” in Carolyn as something that stood out in the character.“She loved (him) so much and she wanted so much to connect with him. (That) was at the heart of it,” she said.At the 2000 Oscars, Bening would lose out to Hilary Swank, who won best actress for “Boys Don’t Cry.” The same would happen five years later, when Bening was again nominated for best actress for “Being Julia,” and Swank snagged the trophy for “Million Dollar Baby.”But Bening only has fond memories of the time and of making the often overlooked “Being Julia,” in which she got to portray a vindictive and calculating stage actress in 1930s London who somehow remains completely charming.“I got the (“Being Julia”) script and read it and thought, ‘Are you kidding me? Am I really being asked me to do this? This is so cool! This is so rich. It’s so complex!’” she remembered.The movie, directed by István Szabó, whom Bening called “the king of Hungarian cinema,” was filmed in Budapest in the summer of 2003. Bening’s children were young at the time and with her during production, which she called “quite an experience.”“We still have lots of funny memories about being in Budapest at the time,” she said. “It was a dream, really a dream.”Bening’s career has only blossomed since then. She earned another Oscar nomination in 2011 for “The Kids Are All Right,” and had a string of roles that were met with acclaim but overlooked by the Academy – notably 2016’s “20th Century Women” and “Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool” in 2017.Bening is far from done. Fresh from her acclaimed and very waterlogged turn in “Nyad” opposite fellow nominee Jodie Foster, she’s about to hit the small screen in her first-ever starring television role, opposite Sam Neill in the Peacock Original “Apples Never Fall,” based on the book by Liane Moriarty of “Big Little Lies” fame. In the show, Bening plays a retired tennis coach and mother who mysteriously goes missing in the series pilot.This is the first time Bening has had a chance to explore a character over seven episodes.“From an acting standpoint, I was delighted,” she said of the experience.As Sunday’s Oscars approach, Bening said she is excited to “be a fan.”“I love the movies this year. There’s a lot of really good movies,” she said, specifically calling out Japan’s﻿ nominated international feature “Perfect Days” and several short films as favorites.“Some of what I get to do is be a fan and go up to people and say, ‘Wow, you did great!’”Then comes the most satisfying part of it all, she said: “I get to go home, take my shoes off, hang out with my dog and my husband, and just walk away from it all.”That is – if her decorated oeuvre is any indication – until her next acclaimed role throws her right back into it."

        "title": "‘Spaceman’ launches Adam Sandler into a heavy-handed sci-fi drama",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Adam Sandler’s deal with Netflix means pretty much doing whatever he wants, which, in the case of “Spaceman,” means traveling to the furthest reaches of space as the near-solitary star of a pretentious, message-heavy drama. Violating “Seinfeld’s” “No hugging, no learning” rule, the concept holds some interest for a time but runs out fuel before reaching home.Adapted from Jaroslav Kalfař’s novel titled “Spaceman of Bohemia” by director Johan Renck (an Emmy winner for “Chernobyl”) and writer Colby Day, the film features Sandler as a Czech astronaut named Jakub, having spent more than six months journeying to take samples of a mysterious space cloud. Yet while mission control tries to keep him focused on matters at hand – and underwrites the venture by having Jakub, a celebrity back home, read ads for things like anti-nausea medication – all is not well back on Earth.Indeed, Jakub has noticed that his wife, Lenka (Carey Mulligan, between this and “Maestro,” the VIP of under-appreciated wives in Netflix movies), has stopped sending messages, and he’s fretting about the strained nature of their relationship. He’s right to worry, since Lenka wants to end things, a revelation that the leader of the space agency (Isabella Rossellini) is reluctant to share, lest it distract Jakub from the mission.Before Jakub can reach his objective, though, he receives an unexpected visitor in the form of a wise alien with a soothing voice (provided by Paul Dano, who excels at this sort of creepiness) that belies its unsettling appearance.After getting over his initial shock, Jakub begins to build a relationship with the alien, whom he names Hanuš. The extreterrstrial takes an inordinate interest in details of the life of this “skinny human,” and especially his relationship with his mate. The why of that stays a bit murky, but the thrust involves the not-terribly-subtle lesson that we sometimes have to go far away to realize what’s really important and that there’s no place like home, Auntie Em.After playing a supporting role in “You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah” – a showcase for his daughters – and scratching his sports itch with “Hustle,” Sandler seems to relish this dramatic turn as the pained astronaut, driven professionally to the point of jeopardizing his marriage. The actor has exhibited plenty of range, but one suspects Netflix would much prefer his next endeavor tilt closer to “Murder Mystery” territory.While there’s a fair amount of “Gravity” in the outer-space trappings and the way Sandler has to hold the screen, “Spaceman” feels a little too weighty in its reliance on emotional cliches. Whether that’s ultimately due to the underlying material or the heavy hand brought to translating it, the net effect is a failure to launch.“Spaceman” premieres February 23 in select theaters and March 1 on Netflix. It’s rated R."

        "title": "‘Shōgun’ might be the TV program of the year (again) in FX’s majestic new telling",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "In the early heyday of miniseries, “Shōgun” was the show of the year in 1980, and it might be again 44 years later. FX’s updated, sumptuous version of James Clavell’s sweeping novel blends an intoxicating combination of action, romance and political intrigue, majestically spread over 10 parts that, unlike most limited series, sustain that weight and then some.Set in feudal Japan at the start of the 17th century, the story begins with a European ship that reaches a fishing village under the stewardship of English pilot John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis).With Japan already visited by Portuguese merchants and Jesuit missionaries – turning the country into Portugal’s “secret empire in the East” – the locals are wary and indeed brutal toward the “barbarian” invaders, in scenes that pushed network standards back in 1980 and that are exceeded in those visceral qualities here.“I won’t die in this wretched land,” Blackthorne says defiantly, although given how the odds are stacked against him, that sounds like a hollow pledge.Soon, though, word of the English pilot, or “Anjin,” reaches Lord Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada, recently seen in “John Wick: Chapter 4,” and simply spectacular), who is in the midst of a perilous political battle with other members of the Council of Regents. Those tensions followed the death of Japan’s ruler, leaving a power vacuum until his young son is old enough to succeed him.That chaos also creates the possibility of one regent emerging to consolidate power, and perhaps even gain the title of shōgun. Eager to find any advantage, Toranaga brings the Anjin into his circle, enlisting the lady Mariko (Anna Sawai, in a big step up from Apple’s “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters”) to serve as his translator. Harboring her own complicated past, and locked in an unhappy marriage to the suspicious samurai Buntaro (Shinnosuke Abe), Mariko and Blackthorne gradually forge a bond filled with risk for both.Richard Chamberlain earned the nickname “King of the Miniseries” thanks to “Shōgun” (after Sean Connery passed on the part) and “The Thorn Birds,” and Jarvis, while perfectly fine, can’t match that level of leading-man charisma.Yet part of that has to do with shifting the narrative balance, smartly, toward both enhancing the female roles and the Japanese characters in general, as Toranaga jockeys with his principal rival Ishido (Takehiro Hira), realizing that strategically outmaneuvering him might be the only way to survive.“Shōgun” plunges into a feudal society where life often appears cheap, and ritual suicide (or seppuku) happens with a regularity that’s not for the faint of heart – or for that matter, when it comes to the muscular and stark action sequences, the weak of stomach.Still, if the original NBC miniseries was in many ways ahead of its time, this sweeping, heavily subtitled production arrives in an age that’s far more hospitable to this kind of ambitious storytelling. The only quibble would involve some creative liberties taken with the book near the end (the author’s daughter, Michael Clavell, is among the producers), which are provocative but not necessarily an improvement.Of course, in today’s heavily fragmented streaming environment “Shōgun” won’t be the massive ratings hit that it was back when there were three broadcast networks (and not much else), but those who wade into this dense history will be amply rewarded.“All men can be broken,” Toranaga muses at one point, with a quiet sense of menace and determination.If only all limited series could be half as good as “Shōgun.”“Shōgun” premieres February 27 on Hulu and at 10 p..m. ET the same day on FX."

Charlie Griffin – late Sunday night after the pair left from Virginia Beach enroute to a Manteo, NC marina for repairs, according to a US Coast Guard release.Griffin and his dog Leila were found dead, while the search for Dunn continued for almost two whole days before the Coast Guard suspended the search off the coast of Oregon Inlet, NC, on Tuesday at around 6:30 p.m., the release said.“We searched for 41 hours, conducted 12 search patterns, and covered approximately 400 miles by air, sea and on shore with our local partners to find Chad and bring him home,” US Coast Guard Cmdr. Corrie Sergent said.“It is one of the hardest decisions to call off a search, and we offer our deepest condolences to the families and friends affected by this tragic event,” Sergent later added.According to National Geographic, Griffin was the captain of the fishing vessel Reels of Fortune and appeared on Seasons 2 through 5 of “Wicked Tuna: Outer Banks” with his son.“Charlie was known to all as a spirited fisherman with a big heart. We join Charlie’s family, fellow cast members and friends in mourning his untimely loss,” the National Geographic statement said.According to the Coast Guard, visibility was only a little over half a mile, seas were at 4-6 feet, and winds at 10-15 knots when the men were reported missing.North Carolina Fish and Wildlife will conduct an investigation into the incident.“Wicked Tuna: Outer Banks” is a spinoff of the National Geographic Channel show “Wicked Tuna,” a reality series about commercial tuna fisherman that premiered in 2012.The spinoff focuses on tuna fishermen based in the Outer Banks who fish for the Atlantic bluefin tuna off the coast of North Carolina."

        "title": "Are these the most beautiful coffee shops in the world?",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "(CNN) — As visitors step into The Budapest Café in Chengdu, China, they’re not just treated to a cup of coffee. Rather, they are immediately transported into a space right out of a Wes Anderson movie, thanks to the pastel hues, whimsical furniture and a series of arches and archways, which are meant to mimic the filmmaker’s signature symmetrical one-point perspectives.The Budapest Café is one of many eye-catching businesses featured in “Designing Coffee: New Coffee Places and Branding,” a coffee table book — no pun intended — that puts the world’s most photogenic, eccentric cafés and roasters on display.The book, from author and coffee expert Lani Kingston, who also teaches a course titled “The Anthropology of Coffee” at Portland State University, serves as a reminder that, beyond a good brew, a well-curated aesthetic is today indispensable to a coffee shop building customer loyalty, and standing out in an increasingly competitive social media landscape. (Having viral latte art is no longer enough, it would seem.)In a world where competitors are often crowded together or even lined up next to one another on the same city block, many cafés are doing whatever it takes to stand out. Or, rather, to let their coffee stand out.Minimalism is not just a trendy choice, but a conscious decision when it comes to branding and aesthetics, Kingston told CNN, as it allows a business to communicate that they’re all about their roast.Take, for instance, Chicago’s Metric Coffee, which underwent a brand overhaul to this effect in 2020. Xavier Alexander, the retailer and roaster’s co-founder, told CNN that the right branding is pivotal in the coffee business, as “a new brand coming out every single day.”According to Alexander, Metric Coffee refined its visuals to reflect its core values: transparency and sustainability. The word “coffee” was dropped from the company’s logo, which now simply features the word “Metric” in a sans serif blue logotype; coffee cups and bags are plain white, bearing minimal illustrations, the logo and required text. The goal? To convey simplicity and let Metric Coffee’s products shine on their own.“It’s a more humble approach to providing a product in the market that people can feel good about,” Alexander told CNN, adding that customers have generally welcomed the branding changes.Among coffee shops catering to a younger demographic, however, Kingston noted a pendulum swing towards the opposite of minimalism — or “cluttercore,” as she (and other Gen Z trendwatchers) have dubbed it. Plants, figurines, books and other paraphernalia furnish shelves and walls “to captivate people and keep their attention,” Kingston said, and offer an engaging environment that’s easy to lose track of time and place in. Maximalist, thematic decor also makes a great backdrop for photos and videos shared on social platforms like Instagram and TikTok.Coffee shops in “concrete jungles” often emphasize vibrant paint, furniture and decor to contrast the monochromatic buildings surrounding them, Kingston told CNN. Cafés draped in vivid colors “promise a sense of intrigue.” “They’re saying ‘hey, come in and experience something different from what is out there,’” she explained.Kingston handpicked nearly 60 coffee brands spanning six continents to spotlight in “Designing Coffee,” Some of the most “unique and really creative” venues were concentrated in Asia, she said, though she limited her choices to no more than a couple of cafés from any given country.One of her favorites is Fritz Coffee Company in Seoul, South Korea. Despite being instantly recognizable thanks to its illustrated logo of a seal holding a cup of coffee, what makes the café chain’s branding successful, Kingston said, is that the endearing mascot is used sparsely.Fritz Coffee Company blends “retro and modern elements of Korean culture” to build out its brand identity, she wrote. One of its five locations (pictured above) was built out of a traditional Korean house, or “hanok,” complete with a traditional tiled roof. Step inside, however, and the building features dark, sleek modern decor.Good packaging can be just as important. Belfast-based brand Process Coffee encases its coffee beans in boxes resembling VHS tapes, for example, Its founder, Ben Hamilton, wanted to combine his interests in both coffee and skateboarding, while making a product that playfully evokes pop culture history.In the 1980s and 90s, skateboarding skyrocketed in popularity thanks to homemade videos capturing tricks and stunts. Thus, Process Coffee is centered around the VHS, a symbol which “alludes to skate culture yet still provides a sense of nostalgia for those who aren’t aware of this connotation,” Kingston wrote.“It speaks to (Hamilton’s) passions and interests,” she added. “It really showed how you can bring your own personal style — you don’t have to follow the norm when you’re creating your brand.”Some coffee shops are vying to become a go-to destination by creating experiences akin to “immersive” art exhibitions or museums. Others are inspired by popular TV shows and movies, or modeled after the aspirational culture surrounding coffee’s place in and around the world.Melrose Café, a Hong Kong-based café, is inspired by Los Angeles coffee culture: the shop’s pink and yellow color palette is meant to invoke the iconic West Coast sunsets; its menu includes California-inspired dishes like avocado toast.Elsewhere, Genovese Coffee House (pictured above) in Sydney, Australia drew inspiration from Italian coffee culture. The owner, whose lineage traces back to Italy, looked to his family’s “three generations of coffee roasting” when designing the space. The exterior mimics a “traditional, Italian street-front shop,” Kingston wrote, and the interior features European café furniture and vintage Italian coffee brewers.But regardless of palette, presentation or design inspiration, there is a common threat uniting all the coffee shops in Kingston’s book: They are communal spaces to relax, spend time with friends, and of course, indulge in a pastry and a delectable cup of joe.​​”The coffee shop has, for centuries, been the world’s living room,” Kingston said. “It’s been a place for people to meet outside of their homes. People like to go to places where they feel comfortable and they enjoy their surroundings, and things that are visually aesthetically pleasing to them.”"

        "text": "Charter jets for tycoons and celebrities, a performance by Rihanna and directions to don “jungle fever” outfits when visiting an animal rescue center — that’s how billionaire Mukesh Ambani is kickstarting big fat Indian wedding celebrations for his son.The head of Indian conglomerate Reliance and Asia’s richest man with a net worth of $114 billion according to Forbes, Ambani is known for never doing a party by halves.The occasion of the moment that has India transfixed is a three-day pre-wedding jamboree for his youngest son Anant Ambani, 28, who is set to marry his long-time girlfriend Radhika Merchant, 29. It begins Friday, will entertain 1,200 guests and takes place in a township in Jamnagar near Reliance’s main oil refinery in the western state of Gujarat.The wedding itself does not take place until July and festivities de facto began on Wednesday when Anant and his bride-to-be hosted a communal dinner for local villagers that served 51,000.In addition to pop and R&B superstar Rihanna, US magician David Blaine will perform and there will also be traditional ceremonies in a temple complex.Anant’s pre-wedding bash is likely to be attended by Bill Gates, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, fellow Indian billionaires Gautam Adani and Kumar Mangalam Birla, as well as many cricketers and Bollywood film stars such as Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the plans who declined to be identified.Also likely to attend is Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, which announced a $8.5 billion merger of its India media assets with Reliance’s on Wednesday.Anant is a director at Reliance’s new energy business and one of Ambani’s three children who are the heirs to his empire. Merchant is a director at India’s Encore Healthcare.Ambani also made headlines with his daughter Isha’s wedding in 2018 which was described by some as a mini-Davos summit. Former U.S. Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among those who hit the dance floor with Bollywood stars back then.Guests to Anant Ambani’s celebrations are set to savor 500 dishes created by around 100 chefs.They will be pampered — hair styling, makeup artists and Indian wear drapists are available but only on a “first come, first serve basis,” according to a planning document provided to invitees and seen by Reuters.They will visit a rescue center that Reliance says is home to more than 2,000 animals and has one of the world’s largest elephant hospitals. The dress code is “jungle fever” with guests advised to wear animal print clothing or Hawaiian shirts.Return charter jet flights from New Delhi and Mumbai are on offer, but guests have been asked to limit themselves to only two luggage items or three suitcases per couple. The document cautions that “if you bring more,” there’s no guarantee it will arrive on the same flight.Guests have also been asked to be reasonable in their expectations for laundry services.“Any clothes given to steam (press) will be returned within 3 hours… expecting or requesting anything quicker than that may not be feasible,” it said."

        "text": "A set of Winston Churchill’s false teeth is expected to fetch up to £8,000 ($10,000) when it goes on sale in England next month.Churchill, Britain’s prime minister during World War II, had several sets of upper dentures that were specifically constructed to maintain his natural lisp and were mounted on gold, according to the Cotswold Auction Company, which is holding the sale in Cheltenham on February 6.After losing several teeth while still in his 20s, Churchill carried two sets of the dentures with him all the time, allowing him to make the rousing speeches for which he was so famous.This set was probably made at the start of World War II, the auction house said, and “must be among the most unusual items we have ever sold,” director Liz Poole added in a statement.Designed by Churchill’s dentist, Wilfred Fish, and made by technician Derek Cudlipp, this set was first put up for sale by Cudlipp’s son, Nigel, in 2010, when it fetched £15,200 (then $23,700).“According to Nigel Cudlipp, his father said he could always tell how the war was going from the distance Winston hurled the teeth,” Andrew Bullock of Keys auction house in Aylsham, eastern England, told CNN in 2010. “They were prone to breaking, especially when Churchill got a bit angry.”One set is thought to be buried with Churchill himself, and another is displayed in the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London.Other pieces of World War II memorabilia will also be on sale at the auction. The microphone with which Churchill is reputed to have delivered a VE Day speech on May 8, 1945 is expected to fetch up to £8,000 ($10,000), while a 1941 autograph book filled with 107 signatures of Royal Air Force pilots, many of whom fought in the Battle of Britain, could sell for £20,000 ($25,000)."

        "title": "Pritzker Prize 2024: Japanese housing pioneer Riken Yamamoto wins ‘Nobel of architecture’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "In the Pritzker Prize’s 45-year history, no country has produced more winners than Japan. And on Tuesday, 78-year-old Riken Yamamoto was named the ninth and latest Japanese laureate of an award often dubbed the “Nobel of architecture.”Best-known for innovative housing projects and educational institutions, Yamamoto is something of a surprise choice. But in a press statement announcing the decision, jury chair and former winner Alejandro Aravena described him as “a reassuring architect who brings dignity to everyday life.” He added: “Normality becomes extraordinary. Calmness leads to splendor.”Across a five-decade career, Yamamoto has dedicated himself to fostering community in Japan’s rapidly expanding cities. From housing projects that coax residents into spontaneous interactions to a glass-walled fire station that invites passersby to peer inside, his architecture appears intent on “blurring boundaries between its public and private dimensions,” a jury citation added.As such, Yamamoto has more in common with other recent winners of the Pritzker Prize — an award that increasingly favors socially-minded architects over the creators of iconic landmarks — than with the Japanese laureates of eras past.It is a point of difference tracing back to the early 1970s: While many of his avant-garde compatriots (most notably 1987 Pritzker laureate Kenzo Tange) advocated conceptual floating cities and grand “megastructures,” Yamamoto was driving across the continents with his mentor to see how people lived in villages around the world. Speaking to CNN ahead of Tuesday’s announcement, he described these formative journeys as “my starting point as an architect.”What Yamamoto found, whether in north Africa or central America, was that human societies were traditionally built around a fluid threshold between private and shared spaces — between villages and the households within them. In modern metropolises, however, this divide has become entrenched to the detriment of their inhabitants, he said.“In the city, we have very few communities — sometimes no community,” Yamamoto said on a video call from Yokohama, near Tokyo, where he founded his architecture firm more than 50 years ago.Social isolation is a concern for both architecture and urban planning. Yamamoto said that cities’ preference for zoning, which governs how land is used, often keeps daily life and commercial activity apart; soaring residential towers (or “tower mansions” as he called them, using a direct but fitting translation of the Japanese term for high-rise condos) meanwhile reinforce what he called the “one family, one house” system.“You can sometimes have 5,000 people living completely independently from the city, and the people inside (tower blocks) are independent of each other… most Japanese people believe this is the ideal living system. I don’t agree with that.”Yamamoto’s solution has been housing that encourages neighbors and the public to come together — a form of architectural intervention that “suggests rather than imposes,” as the Pritzker Prize jury put it.After designing a succession of private homes in his early career, Yamamoto completed his first social housing project, in the coastal city of Kumamoto, in 1991. Hoping to inspire a sense of openness, he arranged its 110 homes into 16 clusters around a tree-lined central courtyard. The central public space has no gates and can only be reached by passing through the housing blocks, a scheme designed to increase the likelihood of chance encounters.Elsewhere, the Shinonome Canal Court project in Tokyo saw Yamamoto connect six huge residential blocks with a second-floor deck comprising terraces and shared green spaces. Pangyo Housing in Seongnam, South Korea (which is among a handful of projects the architect completed outside Japan) also linked homes via communal decks, though the development boasted an altogether more radical design feature: glass walls on the ground level of each residence invited neighbors to look inside one another’s houses.Yamamoto acknowledged this could be seen as an afront to privacy. And, at first, residents felt like they were living in a “fishbowl,” the architect recalled. But over time, they warmed to the idea.“It became very popular, and people liked it … sometimes they use (the ground-floor space) as a gallery. Sometimes it’s the guest room. Sometimes it’s a place to drink and sometimes people gather there,” he said, adding that residents subsequently invited him to a community party at the complex. “I was really, really happy at that moment, because they agreed with my design.”The idea of transparency has informed much of Yamamoto’s oeuvre — and not only housing. The clear glass facade, walls and floors of the fire station he designed in Hiroshima offer pedestrians a rare glimpse inside an institution that, while publicly funded, often hides its inner workings. At the Saitama Prefectural University and Future University (in Koshigaya and Hakodate, respectively), soaring windows provide unobstructed views between classrooms and even departments in the hope of stimulating academic collaboration.If Yamamoto’s civic gestures sound like simple solutions to urban ills, maybe that’s because — by his own reckoning — they are: “It’s very easy to make a community space and public space,” he said, framing his ethos as a return to the way public space operated in medieval Europe or Edo-period Japan.And yet, politics and profit have sometimes stood in the way. Yamamoto expressed dismay that more than 30 years after completing his aforementioned housing project in Kumamoto, his vision of shops and cafes occupying its lower reaches has not yet come to fruition due to local zoning regulations. Perhaps a greater challenge, he added, comes from property developers accustomed to promoting the benefits of standalone private homes.“Of course, political support is very important. But I think developers (should) change their minds a little bit. They believe that ‘one house, one family’ is the best way. I propose to the developer: change the system.”First awarded to American architect Philip Johnson in 1979, the Pritzker Prize recognizes what it describes as architects’ “consistent and significant contributions to humanity and the built environment.”Yamamoto, who has also completed buildings in China and Switzerland, is the latest in a string of laureates recognized for their commitment to the public and civic realms.Last year’s award went to British architect David Chipperfield, who is best-known for cultural institutions like Des Moines Public Library in Iowa his reimagined Neues Museum in Berlin. In 2022, Francis Kéré became the first ever African laureate in recognition of a career designing schools, health centers and community facilities.The Japanese architect will be awarded with $100,000 and a bronze medallion."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Archaeologists have discovered the earliest dated cave paintings in South America in Argentine Patagonia, dating back 8,200 years.The 895 paintings were found by Argentine and Chilean archaeologists in the Huenul 1 cave, a 630 square meter (6,781 square foot) rock shelter located in the province of Neuquen, some 1,100 kilometers (684 miles) southwest of the capital Buenos Aires.“We were able to date four black peniform patterns that were drawn in charcoal. These proved to be the earliest direct dating of cave paintings in South America,” said Dr. Guadalupe Romero Villanueva, author of the research published in the Science Advances journal.The Argentinean archaeologist said the discovery indicates that the production of cave art began in the Huenul cave about 8,000 years ago and that the practice of painting the particular pattern seen in the cave was sustained for a period of at least 3,000 years.The discovery provides evidence of the artistic ability and cultural transmission of the hunter-gatherer societies which inhabited the region during the middle Holocene, a period roughly from 7,000 to 5,000 years ago, and reveals the socioecological resilience to climate, as well as serving as a means of communication between scattered populations.“We believe these images in particular were part of a resilient response of the mobile hunter-gatherer groups that occupied this cave and the desert environments of northern Patagonia to the climatic challenge of a period of extreme dryness that occurred during the middle Holocene,” said Romero Villanueva, a researcher at the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research of Argentina.Villanueva said there are other places in South America that could have older cave paintings, but which only have relative dating, like Argentina’s Cueva de las Manos, with cave paintings dating back 9,500 years."

        "title": "‘My beliefs haven’t changed’: From social housing to skyscrapers, architect Moshe Safdie is still an idealist",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "There are few buildings that have more drastically shaped a city’s image than Marina Bay Sands. Just as the Eiffel Tower and Burj Khalifa define the skylines of Paris and Dubai, the soaring three-tower resort, joined across the top by a horizontal “skypark” and the world’s most famous infinity pool, is an icon both in and of Singapore.In fact, the hotel-casino project is so successful that the man who designed it doesn’t even stay there.“It’s too noisy,” said Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. “I’m a swimmer and I can never get in the pool because there are so many people taking pictures.”Now resuming his once-frequent trips to Singapore amid easing travel restrictions, Safdie prefers the nearby Ritz-Carlton, where we meet for afternoon tea. (“I had a British mother,” he explained, “so I’m a sucker for scones and tea.”) At a top-floor table overlooking his best-known creation, he reflected on the sometimes-fraught task of designing contemporary landmarks.“It wasn’t on my mind as much as it was on their minds,” he clarified, recounting the call for design proposals issued by the city-state’s government in the mid-2000s. “They didn’t quite say the building should become the icon of Singapore, but they talked about it being iconic.“When we made the submission, I said, ‘Some buildings have the magic to become memorable and associated with a place.’ And I mentioned Sydney Opera House as the classic contemporary example. But, I said, ‘It’s a mystery what makes that happen.’”The trick, it transpired, was designing something striking yet simple. Constructing a 0.2-mile-long cantilevered roof terrace atop three skyscrapers required a feat of complex engineering but, at its most abstract, Marina Bay Sands can be sketched in four basic strokes. In Singapore Sign Language, the landmark is referenced by simply raising three fingers of one hand and resting another digit across the top. Visible for miles around, it appears on postcards and newscast backdrops. The structure also stars in the official Singapore Lego set, which the architect proudly displays at his office back in Somerville, Massachusetts.“That kind of stuff, you can’t quite plan for or design – it just happens,” he said of the building’s success. “But I’m very happy about it. It changed our lives in terms of the work we get.”Safdie’s eponymous firm is in high demand. In the years since Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010, he has realized almost 20 major projects. Among them are the serene Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas and a dual-tower residential complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka, that sees one high-rise lean dramatically against the other. The architect also bequeathed Singapore with another landmark in 2019: Jewel, a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex that attracts throngs of Instagrammers to Changi Airport each day thanks to its verdant indoor waterfall.Safdie has said he considers seeing finished projects in use to be among an architect’s greatest pleasures. He makes a point of visiting Jewel whenever he’s in Singapore. “I was concerned about how the plants were doing,” he said. “But I was relieved to see they’re thriving.”The architect is not in Singapore to indulge in past glories, however. In the days after our interview, he will inspect two new developments: a gardenesque office complex in the island’s west and a pair of residential towers on the upmarket Orchard Road. The latter features multiple skybridges – a recurring theme in Safdie’s work that was recently taken to new extremes in Chongqing, China, where he lay a gargantuan “horizontal skyscraper” (containing an infinity pool, restaurants and an indoor garden) atop four 820-foot-tall towers.Then there is the small matter of Marina Bay Sands’ second phase. The expansion plans feature, among other things, a fourth tower – though Safdie dismissed early suggestions that his iconic skypark might be extended to rest across its top. In any case, Singapore officials have expressed that he shouldn’t, in his words, “screw around” with an icon.Instead, the new tower will stand apart from the other three, forming “sort of an exclamation mark,” he explained, motioning punctuative strokes: “Boooom… boom.”At 84, Safdie shows little sign of slowing down. Other recent trips have taken him to Sao Paolo, Brazil, where his glass-roofed Albert Einstein Education and Research Center recently opened its doors, and to the Ecuadorian capital Quito, where his tree-covered Qorner Tower will do so later this year. Covid-19 eased the architect’s unrelenting travel schedule, but he used the downtime to pen a memoir, “If Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.” He said he felt it was “time to document things.”Published this week, “If Walls Could Speak” serves as a reminder that much of Safdie’s six-decade career has been dedicated to humbler pursuits – museums, memorials and social housing that reimagined how people might live in densely populated cities.Before Marina Bay Sands, his best-known project was his very first: Habitat 67, a radical 1960s housing development that saw hundreds of identical prefabricated concrete units stacked into clusters along Montreal’s Saint Lawrence River. Safdie’s dream that it would spark a wave of large-scale “Habitats” around the world proved overly optimistic. His attempts to repeat the feat in other cities, including New York, Toronto and Iran’s capital Tehran, have often been thwarted. Projects of such size require land, funding and political will, and Safdie’s book openly recounts times when all three were lacking.But the principles underpinning the experiment – that apartment dwellers should enjoy access to outdoor space, views in multiple directions and the opportunity to interact with nature and neighbors – defined his work thereafter.Born in 1938 in Haifa, then part of British-controlled Palestine, Safdie has credited much of this architectural ethos to his childhood. As a boy, he always lived in apartment buildings, first in a Bauhaus-style block on Haifa’s Mount Carmel and then at his family’s new home further up the hill. At the latter, he would enter via a bridge, while the famous Baha’i Gardens “almost functioned as my backyard,” he writes in “If Walls Could Speak.” One need not look far for the inspiration behind the skybridges and elevated urban gardens that have since characterized his oeuvre.Safdie moved to Canada with his parents aged 15. (In a neat turn of events, he departed Israel via Lod Airport, since renamed Ben Gurion Airport, where decades later he would design a terminal building.) It was in Montreal that Safdie decided to pursue architecture – and where he first grew his signature mustache. He attended the city’s McGill University and wrote a college thesis, “A Case for City Living,” outlining his vision for a flexible housing “system” that could be adapted to different contexts and climates.Those early ideas have long shaped Safdie’s outlook. They would shape his fortunes, too. After showing his college drawings to the influential modernist Louis Kahn, he secured an apprenticeship at the architect’s Philadelphia office. Soon after, he was offered the chance to put his ideas into practice at a scale unimaginable to most young graduates.Montreal was due to host the 1967 World Fair, or Expo 67. Despite having never completed a building, the then 24-year-old Safdie was asked by the event’s mastermind (and his thesis adviser), architect Sandy van Ginkel, to develop a master plan for the site. He was also tasked with building on his ideas, eventually proposing a village-sized development of some 1,200 prefabricated dwellings stacked 20 to 30 stories high. His meticulous placement of each factory-built module was calculated to maximize garden space, allow in sunlight and improve residents’ views. Interconnected pedestrian walkways and bridges lifted the urban realm above ground.Political and financial realities scaled back his design; the final Habitat 67 comprised just 154 apartments – made from 354 modules and stacked 12 stories high across three “clusters.” It was, nonetheless, a major statement. In a postwar world rethinking how to accommodate rapidly urbanizing populations, Safdie’s system of repeated modular forms offered a bold new model for housing. Three of the 20th century’s most important architects, I.M. Pei, Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson, toured the project together prior to its opening. Only when Johnson told Safdie that he had “outdone” the classical Italian architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi did he realize the project “was a game changer,” he recounted.Habitat 67 was not universally adored. A New Yorker cartoon, which Safdie also displays at his Boston office, poked “gentle fun” at the project by depicting a spade-wielding child stacking sand into similar formations. Various journalists and fellow architects were more barbed in their criticisms.“It’s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it,” Safdie mused. “But that’s been true of my career.”To define Safdie’s career by either his breakout success or the “megascale” projects of recent years would be to ignore much else in between.In the early 1970s, he opened an office in Jerusalem, a city whose urban fabric he has profoundly transformed. As well as designing major institutions like the Hebrew Union College and the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, he oversaw a full-scale rebuild of the destroyed Jewish Quarter and planned an entirely new city, Modi’in-Maccabim-Re’ut, about 15 miles to its northwest. At one point, he even considered running for mayor of Jerusalem.He has also built widely in North America, where his output spans from the meditative (a nondenominational chapel at the Harvard Business School) to the mammoth (Terminal 1 of Toronto’s Pearson Airport). A citizen of Israel, the US and Canada, Safdie may be best known in the latter for the National Gallery in Ottawa, a grand glass palace housing some of the country’s most treasured art.Despite earlier setbacks Safdie has, more recently, found fertile ground for his “Habitats” in Asia. In 2017, he completed the first phase of the sprawling Habitat Qinhuangdao – in the titular city, about 200 miles from Beijing – a series of 16-story “mini blocks” connected by garden bridges. Back in Singapore, Safdie’s pixelated Sky Habitat tower saw him stretch his familiar stacked forms high above the ground to maximize floor space on a comparatively small plot.In both cases – and throughout Safdie’s career – ideals articulated in the 1960s have been adapted to meet the realities of new sites and clients. Yet, the architect maintains that his approach to housing remains, fundamentally, the same.“The belief in apartments being rethought as houses, in having gardens for every apartment, in quality of life, in streets and communities and making buildings that belong to their culture – from the outset these were fundamental to my beliefs,” he said. “And they haven’t changed. If anything, they have reinforced themselves as years go by.”“I think, without bragging, there’s been consistency,” he added. “In fact, you could say I’ve not been dynamic enough, but I’ve been pretty consistent.”There were other high-profile proposals that never came to fruition. Among the most divisive was the Columbus Center, a pair of heavy-set towers once set to loom over Manhattan’s Central Park at Columbus Circle before plans were scrapped following 1987’s Wall Street crash (and amid vociferous criticism from the likes of Henry Kissinger and Jacqueline Onassis).But Safdie’s legacy will not be measured only by what was, or wasn’t, built. Many of the once-radical ideas he championed are now mainstream – something he can take an amount of credit for. For one, his fixation on plant life, a principle he dubbed “for everyone a garden” in a 1974 book of the same name, is now widely shared by younger architects. Urban gardens and “living walls” are now almost de rigueur for new large-scale developments.Plants do not always thrive, though. In his memoir, Safdie distinguishes between “significant plant life” and “sorry shrubs.” So-called biophilic architecture may now be all the rage, but it can be undone by insufficient planning or maintenance, leaving occupants with dying trees and even bug infestations. As such, Safdie welcomes the trend while cautioning again token gestures.“The idea of green buildings is a battle cry – everyone is for it,” he said. Making them work, however, is another matter altogether. “There’s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then, in the renderings, everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees. When you look (closer), you see there’s no preparation for the earth, there’s no depth – it’s a fantasy.”Prefabrication, championed by the architect since his college thesis, is also enjoying a renaissance. Just two miles away from Marina Bay Sands, for instance, a Singaporean design firm is overseeing two 630-foot-tall residential skyscrapers built from units constructed in a factory over the border in Malaysia.“For a long time, people totally gave up on (prefabrication),” Safdie said. “But now there is a real shortage of labor and skilled labor – not in China, because they’ve got an extraordinary workforce, and not in India, but everywhere else in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, in the West. So, anything that is labor-saving is now up for grabs.”Much else has changed since Safdie formed his architectural ideals. For one, he “never would have imagined” how densely populated cities would become in the past 50 years. “Programs change, lifestyles change, priorities change and technologies change,” the architect added.But what about him? Has his outlook changed, too? “My daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as I was,” the architect said. “I disagree with her.”Safdie is nonetheless aware that the lofty principles of his youth may not be shared by the casinos or corporate clients he often works for. Being an architect sometimes means serving “regimes you’re not in love with and business entities whose values are different to yours,” he noted.“Take the dilemma I had with Marina Bay Sands,” he said, motioning once more toward the window and our view of the complex from the Ritz-Carlton’s lounge. “On the one hand, the idea of doing a building that could promote ‘gaming’ – that’s a nice word for it, but ‘gambling’ is the reality – is almost immoral if you go there and see poor people with limited means wasting their money.“But, to me, that was 2% or 3% of the area of a project that… could show what the public realm could be in a city. And that took over from the issue that nagged me.“That’s compromise,” he concluded. “But the basic value, the idealism of the end product, has not diminished. Without it, I don’t know how you can be an architect.”“If Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture,” published by Grove Atlantic, is available now."

        "title": "Paris Fashion Week: Fashion, feminism and a fake Kate Moss",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Although Paris Fashion Week is usually the talk of the town — and every social network — this week the French capital was preoccupied with events more notable than clothing.In an historical vote on Monday — a few days ahead of International Women’s Day (March 8) — the French parliament enshrined the right to abortion into its constitution, the first country in the world to do so. As runway shows popped up in every neighborhood, hundreds also gathered at the city’s famed Trocadero in front of the Eiffel Tower, to follow the historic event on giant screens.Paris has been a theater of style and politics for decades, so it is intriguing to note the revival of late 60s fashion this week. Indeed, this season’s Saint Laurent show revived many aspects of the founder’s 1968 collections (which can currently be admired at the Saint Laurent Museum in the French capital) featuring thinly — but colorfully — veiled nudity. A sartorial manifestation of sexual freedom that coincided with the student revolts of May 1968 where women fought notably for reproductive rights — then, and now again.So if clothing embodies needs, desires and progress, what can be deduced from this week’s garments, shown at a time and place when sexual agency is once again taking center stage?On runways, the women conjured seemed to thrive towards new realities, possibilities and celebrations. Japanese label Undercover dedicated its collection to working mothers, as models marched with bags filled with groceries to the sound of a poem by movie director Wim Wenders, “Watching a working woman.” Balmain’s was an ode to older women, Ester Manas focused on women of all sizes, whilst Nina Ricci highlighted sexually emancipated gender roles. The Parisienne’s static archetype seemed to embrace less normative, narrow ideals towards a wider scope of lifestyles and choices.The week, all seemed possible — even living your life as a Kate Moss lookalike, as model Denise Ohnona showed when she fooled paparazzi and social media users alike as she marched down the Marine Serre runway. The sky’s the limit.If revivals and historical citations always come carrying reinvigorated meanings, this season’s love affair with retro chic was no exception.Rochas’s first collection by Alessandro Vigilante delved into the house’s 1930s archives. Presented in a boudoir-like setting, old-school glamour was on display. Think technicolor lace, satin lingerie, froissé (mussed up) velvet indoor pieces – as a way to tie back to “one’s imagination and to anticipate women’s desires” said the designer after the presentation, offering indulgent rather than flashy luxury.Chanel’s show was steeped into Deauville references, the French beach resort in Normandy where Coco first set foot in 1913. The seaside-inspired collection featured pinned up floppy hats, soft knitted suits and loose embroidered tweed, celebrating a sense of freedom of movement and mobility.As for Chemena Kamali’s debut for Chloé, the show cited the house’s early years in the 1970s, with flouncy blouses, sheer ruffled dresses and dangling golden jewelry merged with post-Y2K boho chic (Sienna Miller sat front row witnessing her own revival). For Kamali, this sought to communicate a message of unfiltered liberty and beauty. “I want to honor the forward-thinking spirit that Gaby Aghion pioneered when she founded the house more than 70 years ago,” she said in the show notes. “She wanted to liberate women and empower them to be daring and feel free.”A bejeweled, preppy Kristin Scott Thomas at Miu Miu, sex-bomb Farida Khelfa at Mugler. Carine and Julia Roitfeld side-by-side at the Victoria Beckham, show and Anna and Pat Cleveland next to Jerry Hall and Georgia Jagger at Chloé. Both front row and on runways, women of all ages were present.Moving away from a seemingly never-ending “kidulthood” ideal, older models sported all looks and genres, from the techno-infused at Balenciaga to dishevelled punky tailoring at Ottolinger, proving there is no age barrier to embracing subcultural trends.“Age is not something I think of, or which defines (my) woman’s style - to me she stands out by her attitude, her singularity, her eccentricity’’ said designer Charles de Vilmorin about his eponymous ready-to-wear debut, made of arabesque-adorned silk pieces.Are heritage houses targeting mothers and daughters through one same collection? At Loewe — like at Rabanne — the playful use of tartan could be read both as a simultaneous wink to heritage and grunge. At Dior, twisted classics — a trench-coat, but make it cropped, in leopard print, or splattered with the words “Miss Dior”— seemed to be both referencing Jackie O and Gossip Girl.Traditionally, showing interest in celebrities (“Les people” in Parisian slang) was a big no-no amongst the proudly snobby French fashion press. Yet, this season more than ever before, the true show was very much on the front row: Salma Hayek and Kim Kardashian chatting away at Balenciaga; Naomi Campbell and Penelope Cruz catching up at Chanel; Hari Nef, Emily Ratajkowski and Charli XCX striking a pose, seemed to be part of the spectacle itself. Not forgetting the K-pop stars gathering hordes of fans outside venues.It is a trend that points to a total shift in the French media landscape. Alexandre Maras, deputy editor-in-chief and head of social media of leading celebrity magazine Gala (its TikTok account amasses over 10m followers) said “editors once were reluctant to integrate celebrities in their coverage, but today, post-pandemic and with the rise of TikTok, every single title documents (a star’s) presence as it drives the most traffic. It has led the way to other celebrities, social media stars, sports players, and has changed the way we think of fame, and who we consider famous.”Pulling away from meme-like fashion that has ruled runways and TikTok alike, the quiet luxury movement continues apace.The Row’s show had a “no phones” policy. Debates on-line didn’t miss the point: What was it really about, discretion or elitism? Victoria Beckham entered a more conceptual, sculptural design phase that is anything but Insta-baiting. From Hermès to Carven’s debut by Louise Trotter or Dries Van Noten, the focus was on elevated minimalism for discreetly opulent wardrobes.“There is a sense that fashion is re-centering on ultra-luxury customers with private salon (events), (increased) discretion and private offers, inspired by the couture tradition of yesteryear,” said Sophie Abriat, fashion journalist at Le Monde newspaper’s magazine, M. “There is a return to classical, hushed opulence, suggesting a pre-21st century, ladylike Parisienne with a focus on quality’’ she added about wardrobes fit for only a few lifestyles and budgets.Sexy — not to say nude — was also part of the agenda, as Valentino, Saint Laurent and Givenchy opted for entirely sheer, dramatic formal evening wear. Clothing for women who needn’t worry about public transport.And then there is Creativity with a capital C, not only as displayed in the clothes, but everywhere else. “The creative part, (including) the set design, is the most luxurious part (of the show). Luxury is scarcity, it is something rare. And creativity is rare right now,” said Balenciaga creative director Demna after the show. With invites consisting of individually thrifted presents sent to guests, the collection was bathed in a soundtrack by musician (and husband) BFRND and featured floor-to-ceiling screens.At Acne, architectural molded dresses marched through a dystopian decor by Estonian artist and scupltor Vilu Jaanisoo made from recycled tires to accompany a collection quoting punk and S&M — fit for an art gallery as much as a red carpet.At Courrèges, the futuristic, deconstructed silhouettes circled around an inflated decor that appeared to breathe, co-created by set designer Rémy Brière, label artistic director Nicolas Di Felice, and creative studio Matière Noire. In creating these “moments,” shows become bespoke art performances, an unique experience that brings an added value for people present.“Form follows function,” architect Louis Sullivan wrote in 1886, and this guideline for designers has not lost its power to inspire.Today, that means understanding the daily needs of women as a starting point to innovation. At Marine Serre, stretchy night-meets-day bodycon pieces, complete with pizza boxes and a caddy as runway accessories, suggest clothes that follow various emergencies and cravings, round the clock.All best illustrated by McQueen, and Seán McGirr’s debut, who shuffled the archetypes, volumes and roles a woman might play within a day. And at Off-White, creative director Ib Kamara’s working woman, global and ageless, came with faux fur, maximalism, in playful, hybrid cuts, breaking boundaries, expectations and labels. Something familiar to Nicolas Ghesquière, who blew out his 10th candle as the head of Louis Vuitton — marking a decade of a fashion both futuristic and steeped in ancestral savoir-faire, as ubiquitous as its monogram. For busy women, multitasking women, women who can."

        "title": "Most countries have made ‘little or no progress’ in returning Nazi-looted art, report finds",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "More than half of the countries that signed a declaration endorsing the Washington Principles — a set of standards meant to guide the return of art looted by the Nazis — have made “little or no progress” in returning stolen property in the 25 years since the principles were drafted, according to a new report released by the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO) on Tuesday.The framework for restitutions was drafted during the Washington Conference on Holocaust Era Assets in 1998 and consists of 11 non-binding principles meant to guide countries with different legal systems through issues related to art seized during the Nazi era within the context of their own laws. The principles also encourage countries to identify and research cultural property that may have changed hands during World War II and to return work that was looted, confiscated or sold under duress.Of the 47 nations that endorsed the 2009 Terezin Declaration, which incorporated the principles, seven have made major progress, three have made substantial progress, 13 have made some progress and some 24 countries have made little or no progress, according to Tuesday’s report.“This report underscores the critical need for advancement in art and cultural property restitution,” Gideon Taylor, the president of WJRO, said in a statement. “Restitution from public bodies or private individuals is not just about returning what was taken. It’s about reconnecting families and communities with their heritage. Over the past 25 years, there has been significant progress, but much work lies ahead.”The ratings were based on whether a country has done historical research on the restitution of art taken during World War II, has looked into the provenance of its own collections, has determined a process for claims to be made on potentially looted art or has made a substantial number of restitutions.The countries determined to have made major progress in implementing the Washington Principles are Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and the US. The 13 countries that have made some progress include Argentina, Belgium, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland and Serbia.Most countries that signed onto the Terezin Declaration have made little or no progress, according to the report. These include Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Ireland, Russia, Spain and Turkey.The release of the report coincided with an event held in New York by WJRO and the US State Department, during which US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken delivered a keynote address via video announcing the endorsement of best practices in art and cultural-property restitution by 22 countries, led by those with dedicated Holocaust envoys. This marks the first governmental document on Holocaust restitution to be endorsed in nearly 15 years, a step WJRO said will help advance the restitution of art and cultural property.In the 25 years since the Washington Principles were established, provenance research has made major inroads thanks in part to the digitization of archives and improved access to them. Most signatory countries have also carried out at least some historical research, and there is more information about how the looting of cultural property took place during World War II, according to the report.However, it points out that museums across the world still “continue to ignore” research, adding that in most countries, probing the provenance of a collection is not considered an essential part of museum practice. The Washington Principles were drafted with the intent of also covering private collections, but there has been far less progress in restituting work now held by individuals, the report found. There remains much room for improvement for provenance research, transparency and facilitating restitution claims when it comes to private collectors, according to the report.“Transparency is key to the just and fair restitution and return of Nazi-looted art and cultural objects to survivors and their heirs,” said Stuart E. Eizenstat, the US Secretary of State’s Special Adviser on Holocaust Issues, in a statement. “The recently endorsed best practices share lessons learned, including the importance of conducting and publishing provenance research, removing legal barriers to restitution and recognizing that looted art includes pieces sold under duress.”While claims processes have been put in place in many countries, the number of cases handled and the number of successful restitutions typically remain low, the report found. Only five of the 47 countries that endorsed the Terezin Declaration have established a restitution commission to handle claims. The report also found that there is a greater public awareness of cultural property that belonged to Jewish communities before World War II, but that in many instances, those pieces remain in private hands rather than being part of the collective heritage of the Jewish people.“For us Holocaust survivors, (these) works of art are part of our cultural heritage, part of our lives, part of our past,” US Ambassador Colette Avital, chairperson of the Center of Organizations of Holocaust Survivors in Israel, said in a statement published by WJRO. “They are the silent witnesses of the lives and loves of individuals, families and communities who were murdered cruelly and whose memories we cherish.”Read more stories from The Art Newspaper here."

        "title": "New sanctions on Russian diamonds will change the global trade in gems",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "After close to two years of conflict, the global diamond market is set to feel the full consequences of the war in Ukraine.The European Union earlier this month added the world’s biggest diamond producer, Russia’s Alrosa, to its sanctions list alongside its CEO, Pavel Alekseevich Marinychev. The new year marked the start of an escalating series of export restrictions on Russian stones coordinated with the G7, which includes the US, UK, Canada and Japan, as well as EU members France, Germany and Italy.Though some countries had already imposed their own sanctions, figuring out a comprehensive system to effectively police the market proved challenging; diamond traders in Antwerp, the Belgian port city that serves as a major trading hub for the precious stones, had lobbied to slow restrictions on the lucrative business. But now that a sanctions scheme has been agreed, it stands to push through seismic changes in the way the diamond industry operates, imposing new requirements for transparency and traceability in a sector that has historically operated with little of either.“These sanctions have been in the works for two years now and it took this long because it’s that challenging to come up with a framework that everyone in the industry can effectively adhere to,” said diamond industry analyst Paul Zimnisky.Though the US and UK banned direct imports of rough diamonds from Russia shortly after the war began, stones cut and polished elsewhere in the world had remained fair game — until now.But as of the start of January, EU and G7 countries have banned the direct purchase of non-industrial diamonds from Russia. This move will be followed by further restrictions on the import of Russian diamonds processed in third countries starting in March. And come September, diamonds sold within the powerful group of countries will need to adhere to a certification scheme to verify where they came from. In Europe, jewelry and watches containing diamonds will be included too.In other words, even if stones are sent halfway around the world for cutting and polishing, if they originated in Russia they’ll be banned from markets in Europe and the G7. And the industry will need to figure out how to prove it.No one seems to really know yet. Diamond supply chains are long and complicated, with stones typically passing through dozens of hands in multiple countries before making it to market.Keeping track of where stones originated while navigating this web of hard-to-police middlemen is notoriously difficult. That’s particularly true for the smaller diamonds Russia is known for producing, which are typically sold in large quantities and often mixed with other stones from other places.So far, the EU and G7 have only painted a broad outline of their plans for a system to trace and verify stones’ origins, with a pilot system set to be operational at the beginning of March. Industry groups including the World Diamond Council, Antwerp World Diamond Centre, the Gem and Jewellery Export Council of India and the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) have been working together to develop an effective solution.“It’s a bit of a work in progress,” said Morgane Winterholer, general manager of strategic brands and sustainability diamond manufacturer Dimexon. “At the moment it is extremely important that the roadmap needs to be developed.”Technology could help. The GIA is able to triangulate data gathered from a rough stone and match it to finished diamonds, but still relies on documentation of where the stone came from to begin with. De Beers has developed a blockchain based traceability system known as Tracr, while other companies are developing their own offerings.But none of these solutions are operating at scale and there’s currently no scientific method to trace a diamond right back to the mine.The new sanctions will dramatically accelerate efforts to build traceability into the diamond industry, in a way that will restructure supply chains that stretch around the world.Big businesses have been preparing for the change. LVMH-owned Tiffany and Richemont both said they stopped sourcing Russian stones shortly after the war in Ukraine broke out. Dimexon has segregated its supply chain to ensure Russian stones don’t reach Western clients, tracking each transaction and relying on direct commercial relationships with mining companies to demonstrate the origin of each package of stones.These changes have market ramifications too. Russia accounts for roughly one third of the world’s diamond supply, but while Russian stones will likely still end up sparkling in engagement rings, necklaces and tennis bracelets bought by consumers in places outside of the new sanctions regime, the countries that will adhere to the diamond ban account for nearly three quarters of global jewelry demand, according to Zimnisky.“In the medium- to longer-term, there will be times the industry runs into supply shortages because of this,” he said.This article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

        "text": "Guinness World Records on Thursday told Frenchman Richard Plaud that his 7.2 meter (23.6 feet) matchstick Eiffel Tower was a record height, a day after rejecting it for using the wrong matches.Plaud said he had been on an “emotional rollercoaster” this week, after spending 4,200 hours over eight years on building his model from more than 706,000 matches and 23 kilograms (51 pounds) of glue.“For eight years, I’ve always thought that I was building the tallest matchstick structure,” he told Reuters.However, Guinness World Records initially told him he didn’t make the cut as he hadn’t used matches that were “commercially available.”Plaud started off by using commercial matches, cutting the head off each. Tired of this tedious process, he asked the manufacturer if he could buy just the wooden sticks without the head, prompting Guinness to refuse his record.“We’re really excited to be able to approve it (…) we’re happy to be able to admit that we were a little bit too harsh on the type of matches needed in this attempt, and Richard’s attempt truly is officially amazing,” said Mark McKinley, director of central records services at Guinness World Records."

        "title": "How this dream-like photo challenges notions of the male gaze",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A group of men lie at the foot of a sofa, their naked bodies peeking out through a carpet of rose petals. Some look toward the photograph’s protagonist, an Asian woman in a lime green dress laying across the cushioned loveseat. Others gaze away, seemingly indifferent, as if caught in some sort of hazy spell.Despite Chinese photographer Yushi Li’s gentle staging, her title for the photograph, “The Smothering Dream,” suggests something more sinister is at play. Referencing Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema’s 1888 work “The Roses of Heliogabalus,” in which a Roman emperor watches on as unsuspecting banquet guests slowly suffocate in flowers, Li’s modern take — shot on a set awash with pastel colors and delicate furniture — is equally deceptive at first glance.Li, is not only the photographer, but also the muse at the center of the image. “I made this very pink and kitsch dream,” she said, describing the London living room set in a phone interview. “But underneath it, there is, like, some kind of violence. It’s a fantasy of love and eroticism… smothering these men I desire.”Shot in 2022, “The Smothering Dream” was recently on show at Photofairs Shanghai as part of a group exhibition called “A Quiet Gaze.” It was a fitting title to showcase the work of an artist for whom an examination of the male and female gazes has been a recurring theme.Li’s wider portfolio of subversive images include softly-lit nude portraits of strangers she scouted through a dating app (a series titled “My Tinder Boys”). Stripped of their clothes and therefore their character, she said, the men lounge around their homes doing banal tasks: one scoops out of a fresh watermelon, while another casually balances a plate of spaghetti over his private parts.The series is partly a response to erotic images objectifying women that are historically ubiquitous in art, advertisements and photography. Although a canon of male nudes does exist, it largely comprises images shot by gay male photographers. When Li began the series in 2017, she noticed a lack of images depicting naked men as objects of desire from a woman’s perspective.After some mistook her work as being shot by a male photographer, she began inserting herself into the photos — fully clothed alongside naked counterparts, and often the only person looking directly at the camera.“Instead of being a passive, ‘looked-at’ thing, I want to be the one who is in control, who is creating the story, who is expressing my fantasy,” said Li.Her images have also pushed back against the longstanding fetishization of Asian women, often by Western men, something Li said she has experienced first-hand: “I’m a small person, and come across as quiet, so I kind of fit the stereotype.” Li, who was born in China’s Hunan province and now lives in the UK.She said she feels flattered when women reach out to her online to say they feel empowered by her photographs. “As a woman, especially as an Asian or Chinese woman, you (should be able to) feel that you can also express your erotic desire.”Li has been fascinated with how the idea of the gaze has, today, become “less binary.” She has also been examining and playing with the way classical paintings depict power dynamics, portrayals of desire and representations of the body.She brings these ideas into “Paintings, Dreams and Love,” an ongoing project to which “The Smothering Dream” belongs. (A second photo from the same shoot, entitled “After the Dream,” hints at what has just taken place, with satin cushions and wilted petals strewn about the scene).Other sources of inspiration include Swiss painter Henry Fuseli’s 1781 “The Nightmare,” showing an incubus crouching menacingly atop a sleeping woman, and “The Death of Actaeon,” Renaissance painter Titian’s 16th-century oil painting of the Romans’ goddess of the hunt, Diana, transforming the Theban hero into a stag that is then killed by his own hounds.In Li’s reinterpretations, she is in full control. In the former, she wears a tight, red turtleneck as she casually sits on an unsuspecting male figure, thwarting the idea of seduction. In the latter, she strikes a calm, calculated pose, pointing a bow and arrow at a naked man in a window.But control, Li says, is subjective in images where multiple gazes can co-exist. “Some of these men (in the photographs) also look at me, and the viewer also looks at all of us,” she said. The internet age, she added, has only further complicated matters. “Now you can look at so many things like instantly, everywhere, or wherever, whenever you want… it’s something very different, it’s not (just) a physical thing, it’s a digital thing.“There’s also the gaze from the algorithm, and the gaze from the screen that reflects yourself when you look at it… the internet (means) we’re subjected to the gaze more, in a way.”"

        "title": "Fairies, dragons and steamy sex scenes: ‘Romantasy’ books are the new must-reads",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Among contemporary readers, a few genres are reliably popular: Crime thrillers, for one, or twisty mysteries that can be turned into limited TV series, or historical dramas that speak to the current moment.But when it comes to the literary flavor that’s dominating readers’ attention in 2024, it’s clear: “Romantasy” reigns supreme.Romantasy has become a popular new term for a familiar subgenre — one that blends the otherworldly escape of high fantasy with the emotional payoff of romance novels, and it’s sweeping millions of readers off their feet. When romantasy protagonists (such as dragon-riders, fairies and fallen angels) aren’t busy saving their worlds, they’re falling deeply in love — often with someone they formerly considered an adversary (the “enemies-to-lovers” trope does big numbers with romantasy readers).BookTok, TikTok’s hugely influential community of bibliophiles, popularized the term “romantasy” last year while discussing the work of Sarah J. Maas, a prolific writer whose “A Court of Thorns and Roses” (or “ACOTAR”) series has proven especially popular.Readers are devouring Maas’ work: She has three books on the New York Times’ top 10 combined print and e-book fiction bestseller list. Another popular romantasy novel, Rebecca Yarros’ “Fourth Wing,” has spent 42 weeks on the New York Times’ bestseller list, while its sequel, “Iron Flame,” is in its 15th week.Romantasy is breaking through among readers who previously didn’t browse the fantasy aisle — and delighting readers who’ve loved it for years. We talk to authors, experts, longtime fans and recent converts about why readers are flocking to romantasy stories, in which treacherous quests are punctuated by steamy trysts.Romantasy is a portmanteau of fantasy and romance, two beloved yet frequently misunderstood genres.“The romance plot is important and central — but so is the fantasy element,” Frankie Diane Mallis, author of romantasy series “Daughter of the Drowned Empire” and adjunct professor at Arcadia University, told CNN.In Yarros’ best-selling “Fourth Wing,” for example, protagonist Violet Sorrengail is tasked with surviving a rigorous dragon-riding program at her magical university while a rebellion brews beyond its walls. SPOILER ALERT: That she happens to fall in love with the dashing warrior — whose father was killed by her mother — is just as critical to her development by the book’s end. It’s a treat for patient readers when they consummate their love. (Yarros couldn’t be reached for comment; a representative said she was deep in the writing process of her next book.)If fantasy literature is epic and spellbinding and romance is wrenching and sensual, then romantasy should be the best of both literary worlds. It’s what bookseller and romantasy fan Gideon Ariel calls “Swiss Army lit” — a subgenre that all readers can enjoy, from longtime fantasy nerds to newcomers.The hits are all there — meticulous worldbuilding, magic, self-discovery, vanquishing foes — all through a romantic lens that softens the denser high fantasy elements.“Romantasy strikes a perfect balance between romance and fantasy that makes for a more enjoyable experience for a lot of readers,” said Ariel, a romantasy specialist at A Room of One’s Own, a queer- and trans-owned bookstore in Madison, Wisconsin.The term’s origins are as murky as the motivations of a romantasy heroine’s mysterious lover. Per the Guardian, Maas’ publisher Bloomsbury claims it invented the portmanteau, but an Urban Dictionary definition for romantasy dates back to 2008. It wasn’t a widely used term among publishers or readers, though, until late 2022 — when the work of Maas and her peers made it to BookTok.But romantasy really took off in 2023, a phenomenon that’s still propelling fantasy romances to bestseller lists. And on TikTok, romantasy hashtags have appeared in more than 200,000 TikToks that have been collectively viewed more than 800 million times.Though Maas’ “ACOTAR” novels, the first of which was published in 2015, are still among the most frequently read and recommended romantasy books, her work belongs to a subgenre that’s existed for decades before the term “romantasy” was used to describe it.Prolific writers like Diana Gabaldon, whose time-traveling historical romance series “Outlander” began in the early 1990s and inspired a popular TV drama of the same name, and Nalini Singh, who’s penned dozens of paranormal romances since the early 2000s, have created millions of fantasy-romance fans across the world. And beginning in 2005, readers couldn’t get enough of Stephanie Meyer’s “Twilight” series, one of the biggest YA hits ever with nearly 160 million copies sold as of 2021.Mallis credits romantasy’s recent rise to indie publishers: Independent imprints like Entangled Publishing have released some of the subgenre’s major successes, including Yarros’ “Fourth Wing.” And there are successful authors, such as Jennifer L. Armentrout, who started out by self-publishing their work before later books were distributed by major publishing houses.Until recently, “the genre didn’t have the chance to flourish” because many romantasy authors lacked access to the publishing industry, Mallis said. “We’ve all been hungry for these kinds of books, and now finally have the means to write them freely, and with social media, we can get them directly into the hands of our readers.”BookTok’s infatuation with romantasy has established it as a major subgenre — and perhaps convinced publishers to take its readers seriously. Many of BookTok’s most popular creators are women, and they’re touting stories often written by women, centering on women’s relationships (even if their partners are orcs, vampires or Greek gods). TikTok is just one arm of a movement by readers and authors to reframe how romance novels and “chick lit” are perceived.“I’ve always been a fan of fantasy, but romantasy has become a space for women’s imagination and storytelling to come to the forefront,” said Gemma Todd, a BookTok personality who regularly recommends romantasy novels to first-time readers.During a time when many women feel powerless against forces that seek to steal their agency, it’s no wonder that romantasy has captured readers’ imagination, said Jayashree Kamblé, an English professor at LaGuardia Community College and president of the International Association for the Study of Popular Romance.“Many romantic fantasy novels give female characters power that reduces female vulnerability and expands choices,” Kamblé said. “So of course we seek creative ways to envision those truths, especially when existing power structures actively want to deny us access to them.”The transportive effect of fantasy romances has been a lifeline for some readers, Ariel said. Books like “Legends & Lattes,” a “cozy romantasy” story that follows an orc who abandons adventuring to open a coffee shop, have provided him with much-needed escapism during difficult times.“The combo of fantasy and romance offers some much needed relief from the frankly dystopian-esque times we seem to be living in,” Ariel said.It can also be comforting to read a story with a reliably happy ending on the horizon: Whether the protagonist and their lover get a happily ever after (“HEA” to regular readers of romance) or wind up happy for now (an “HFN” ending), a good romantasy series almost always ends with someone happily in love, said Beth Gabriel, a librarian in the Milwaukee Public Library system (which also has a sizable TikTok presence, encouraging viewers to read).“No tragedy in my romantasies, thank you,” she said. “If you tell a romance reader it is a romance, (then) Happily Ever After is a legally binding contract, a promise.”Sex scenes appear in many, but not all, romantasy novels. But these aren’t hasty, lightly plotted larks: In many of the most popular romantasy titles, sexual encounters may not show up for hundreds of pages — character building is always paramount.“I still need the tension, and a reason for these kinds of scenes to be happening,” Mallis said, noting she still loves to read and write these scenes. “Sometimes, when the characters reach this point, the tension fades — but if done well, the tension will shift into something else … The more build-up, the better, I think, to achieve this.”Fans often rank books’ “spiciness” in fan forums, even creating guides to the chapters and pages across which the trysts unfold so that readers can skip directly to the sex (or so the spice-averse know which pages to avoid).Sex scenes feature heavily in two current bestsellers: Maas’ “A Court of Flame and Shadow,” the third book in her “Crescent City” series, and Yarros’ “Iron Flame,” a sequel to her hit “Fourth Wing.”In both books, the sex is vivid, sensual and flowery. Lightning pulses through Maas’ and Yarros’ protagonists mid-coitus, and both authors make creative use of the word “entrance.” Perhaps most importantly to readers, the scenes in both books place an emphasis on female pleasure.Longtime romantasy reader and BookTok star Todd is thrilled that the subgenre is having its “water cooler moment.” Countless readers are connecting with it, sharing live reactions to especially emotional chapters and dissecting details with friends and social media followers.And romantasy’s popularity is blooming beyond TikTok, too: Hearkening back to the era when “Harry Potter” and “Twilight” books were still being published, bookstores are hosting midnight release parties for new books by Maas and Yarros.“Having access to these stories and reading them together, if virtually, is fun,” Todd said. “I can then tell my best friends to read it too, and we can share that experience, even if we argue about how much we enjoyed it, or things that made us mad.”Demand for romantasy is so high that there’s a six-month wait for one of the 48 digital copies of “Fourth Wing” in Wisconsin’s digital consortium, Gabriel said. She’s also had to reorder copies of works by Maas, Yarros and Tracy Deonn, author of the popular YA “Legendborn” series.“TikTok is definitely driving demand for books at my library branch, and I love that readers are turning to the public library to try some of these trendy titles,” she said.Ariel, also in Wisconsin, is singing romantasy’s virtues to customers at A Room of One’s Own. But before he discovered the subgenre, he detested reading for school assignments, let alone for pleasure. Now, romantasy is where he turns for renewed hope and escape.“The genre shows that adventure takes all forms, love can and will find a way, and anything is possible.”Looking to give romantasy a try? Here are some of the best books to start with, according to our sources.The hits“A Court of Thorns and Roses,” Sarah J.

        "title": "Google opens New York headquarters in repurposed 1930s railway terminal",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Google is set to open its New York headquarters in a repurposed 1930s railway terminus near Hudson Square on Monday — and the tech giant says the project was designed with nature in mind.The 12-story St. John’s Terminal building, located at the nexus of Hudson River Park, the West Village, SoHo and Tribeca, is being billed as a “workplace designed for teams,” but it’s also providing a new home for local flora and fauna.With 1.5 acres of street-level vegetation, rail bed gardens and terraces that are 95% made up of plants native to New York State, the habitat created by the project has attracted more than 40 bird species, “including birds fueling up for a trans-Atlantic migratory flight,” wrote Google’s president for Americas and Global Business, Sean Downey, in an open letter on Wednesday.“It’s actually re-knitting the ecosystem, from the insects to the birds,” said Rick Cook, a founding partner at CookFox Architects, one of the design firms behind the project, in an introductory video published by Google.Once at the end of the railway now forming New York’s High Line, St. John’s Terminal served as a freight facility and office space. The renovation retained the original rail beds, turning them into planters that hang above the building’s main entrance, and incorporated wood reclaimed from the Coney Island boardwalk after Hurricane Sandy. Google said that the decision to repurpose an old building, rather than constructing its new headquarters from scratch, saved 78,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions (equivalent to taking around 17,000 cars off the road for a year). The tech giant also claimed it had prevented 77% of its construction waste from ending up in landfills.The complex is one of several Google offices built in renovated structures, including a converted flour mill in Dublin, a former aircraft hangar in LA’s Playa Vista neighborhood and Pier 57, once a New York City shipping terminal. The tech firm also owns the nearby Chelsea Market, purchased for $2.4 billion in 2018 after it had been converted into a retail and office development.Google began leasing the St. John’s Terminal site in 2019, and bought it outright in 2022 for $2.1 billion. The building serves as a headquarters for Google’s Global Business Organization, which includes the firm’s sales and partnership teams.The renovation project was commissioned in 2018, before the Covid-19 pandemic, but its final design was later adapted to offer more flexible work arrangements. Google, like many large corporations in America, is trying to entice workers back to the office, and the new campus — whose interiors were designed by international architecture studio Gensler — is being heralded by the tech giant as a place to connect and innovate.“If you’re going to make that commute in, it should be because you can work with people that have passion, that have ideas, that you can sit next to and come up with something that you couldn’t do just on your own, and that’s really the vision of this space,” said Downey in a video introducing the new campus.The building can accommodate around 3,000 workers and is organized into 60 “neighborhoods” for teams of around 20 to 50 people. There are no assigned desks but instead workers can use flexible seating areas or shared spaces including lounges, cafes, terraces and micro-kitchens.“Creativity wants to move around, so we’ve created as much common spaces as we have neighborhood space, if not more, for people to meet, to work, to collaborate,” said Jennifer Kelly, a vice president of workplace experience, in the same video. “Some feel like a library, some feel like a coffee shop, so people have options to use spaces that they feel most comfortable in.”There are currently more than 14,000 Google employees in New York, up from 7,000 when the company announced the St. John’s Terminal project in 2018, despite sweeping layoffs across several divisions earlier in this year. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, also slashed around 12,000 jobs — then around 6% of its workforce — at the beginning of 2023."

        "title": "Was this 19th century portrait painter also the first celebrity stylist?",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "In the spring of 1888, New York socialite Eleanora Iselin welcomed the portrait artist John Singer Sargent into her home, feverish over the question of what she would wear. Eager for her expensive and refined taste to be immortalized on canvas, Iselin instructed a maid to follow her into the drawing room carrying an armful of her best Parisian frocks. To Iselin’s horror, the renowned painter insisted on capturing what she was wearing then and there. No rosy-colored garments, no haute couture ball gown.The result was a slightly stern, removed portrait — one of the main offerings in “Sargent and Fashion,” a new exhibition on show at the Tate Britain until July 7 — with Iselin rendered in a black satin day dress against a muddy-brown backdrop.But while she wasn’t reproduced in the French finery she expected, there is a mesmeric beauty in the satin finish of Iselin’s dress, the glinting embellishments of her corset, the protruding ruffles of her white lace sleeves.“He doesn’t just flatter you. It’s not a servitudinal relationship,” curator James Finch told CNN Style at the London gallery. “It’s a creative one in which each portrait emerges in its own unpredictable way.”There have been countless retrospectives on the 19th century painter, examining his characterful high-society portraits or watercolor landscapes, but “Sargent in Fashion” — created in collaboration with Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts — places the 140-year-old artist in a brand new context.Working during the rise of haute couture, both Sargent and his subjects were living through a new dawn of fashion. “The couturier had more prominence,” said Finch. “And many of the things that we see as hallmarks of the fashion industry nowadays, such as seasonal collections, runways, clothes actually seen on models rather than mannequins, were all being introduced for the first time.”This new, electrifying sartorial landscape brought with it a widespread preoccupation with clothes that not only influenced Sargeants’ artistic eye, but his clients’ desires too. “There is now a class who dress after pictures, and when they buy a gown ask, ‘Will it paint?’” wrote Scottish critic Margaret Oliphant in 1878. Suddenly, fashion wasn’t only about wealth and status, it was self expression, creativity, art. Designers, lauded for their perspective and skill, transcended the title of “dressmaker” and collected loyal followings. Fashion, as Edith Wharton wrote in 1920, was a powerful form of “armor.”While painting clothing is a skill all portrait artists must master, Sargent’s relationship to his sitter’s outfits is unique. He was controlling, with an insatiable need to curate the entire image — including what his subject was wearing. Colors, textures, fabric finishes and silhouettes were, in Sargent’s mind, central to the portrait’s harmony and therefore could not be left to chance.He often disregarded the sartorial preference of his sitter, as was the case with poor Iselin, and shaped what was worn (or at least what was seen) carefully. In 1903, Sargent painted mother and daughter, Gretchen and Rachel Warren, at Fenway Court (now known as the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum) in Boston. The pair sit closely — almost intertwined — with Rachel’s head resting on her mother’s shoulder. Their flushed cheeks are intensified by the pink hue of Rachel’s dress. Only it wasn’t a dress at all. According to the exhibition, the young girl had arrived to sit in an ill-fitting dress of the wrong shade, and instead of making do, Sargent draped a yard of rose-colored fabric around her. By the time the portrait was finished, the scrap of cloth had transformed on the canvas into a diaphanous dress.“He’s not just documenting what’s in front of him,” Finch told CNN. “He’s inserting himself into (the painting) in a way akin to a stylist or a fashion director.”Sargent even commissioned the most prominent couture houses of the time to make dresses for his sitters on occasion. For the portrait of close friend Sybil Sassoon in 1922, he enlisted the help of English couturier Charles Fredrick Worth (whose label, House of Worth, was the first haute couture atelier established in Paris in 1858). Worth created a custom black velvet gown and matching cape trimmed with metal thread lace from for Sassoon, with a tall, vampyric mauve collar. Sargent mirrors the dress’s purple accents in the delicate complexion of Sassoon, and again in the small mauve flower in her right hand.Reframing a centuries old master as something new to be discovered is no small feat, either. Renowned paintings such as “Carnation, Lily, Lily Rose” (1885-86) — which is usually displayed in a darker, red corner of the gallery — are recontextualized against a soft periwinkle display wall designed to amplify the painting’s dwindling evening light.Similarly, with the help of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts textile department, many of the works on show are paired with their original gown. And although Sybil Sassoon’s brooding black taffeta opera cloak looks somewhat flat compared to its five-foot illustrative counterpart, the dressed mannequins act as three dimensional portals into Sargent’s world.“It provides you with a new entry point to the portraits,” said Finch. “You see these garments in front of you and you think about who wore them, how the dresses have survived, and how they’ve been passed down through generations from mother to daughter, and the stories about how the dresses were often adjusted to fit changing body sizes. I think all of that’s really relatable.”But not everyone was pleased about the reassessment of Sargent’s ouevré. During opening week, one British art critic called it a “horrible exhibition” that was “crowded by old clothes.” Finch disagrees. “Showing Sargent’s work in relation to garments doesn’t take away from any of the previous research done on him,” he told CNN.In fact, the exhibition suggests Sargent’s famed ability to capture entire inner worlds through the shadow of a facial expression was enhanced, not stifled, by his evident interest in clothes. For example, reckoning internally with what she likely considered to be a fashion emergency, we glean so much more about Iselin’s character than had Sargent let her wear whatever she wanted.“A lot of Sargent’s contemporaries fell back on formalism,” said Finch. “Their work was ready-to-wear, using off the (rack) elements of portraiture, whereas with Sargent it always was bespoke. Each portrait was different.”"

        "text": "When AC Milan took the field last month in a home game against Napoli — a clash of two of Italy’s most historic soccer clubs — the Milanese team donned blacked-out jerseys designed by Los Angeles streetwear brand Pleasures.Designated as the team’s official fourth kit — the limited edition apparel the team will play in for select games this season with one “light” and one “dark” colorway — the jerseys feature references to Milan’s gothic architecture as well as hip-hop culture.It was an unlikely partnership: the punk-inspired indie streetwear label worn by celebrities like Kylie Jenner and The Weeknd had no prior connection to the Italian sports mainstay. But the commercial reception to it was phenomenal.February 8, the initial launch of the collaboration when jerseys went on sale for fans, was AC Milan’s most successful day in terms of e-commerce sales, up 69 percent above its last record, according to the team. The $180 cream-colored version of the jersey proved to be the biggest hit and has become an all-time bestseller, now trading on StockX for as much as $290.The Pleasures tie-up may have been a surprise to traditional soccer fans, but it was by no means an accident. AC Milan has pursued a number of partnerships — including tapping Off-White as its official “style and culture curator” — since its $1.2 billion acquisition by US investment firm RedBird Capital Partners in August 2022. Under new ownership, the team has positioned itself as not only a soccer club but a lifestyle brand, creating new revenue streams through thoughtfully designed merch that goes beyond one-off collaborations.AC Milan’s infiltration of fashion has gone further than any soccer team before, even France’s Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), which not so long ago was the favored sports collaborator of brands like Dior, Stüssy and Jordan. Its new Qatari owners also invested heavily in growing the team’s brand, but lost its allure to fashion when two of its all-stars, Lionel Messi and Neymar Jr. left the club in quick succession (their final standout player, Kylian Mbappé, is set to depart this summer).Unlike PSG, AC Milan does not have the same kind of international stardom in its squad that automatically comes with cultural caché. The team forged its collaborations as part of a global marketing strategy rather than pegged to any one player, and therefore is less at risk of losing its prestige when the best athletes leave. Its long-term partnership with Off-White, which produced several collections for the men’s and women’s teams off-field use as well, also provides a level of insider access to the fashion industry that has never been achieved by another team before.The Pleasures partnership was designed with the team’s 27 million North American fans in mind, and it yielded the right results: the US accounted for the most sales of the Pleasures jersey outside of Italy. It was also intended to reach younger fans, and over 60 percent of sales went to consumers aged under 30, according to the club.AC Milan’s unique deal with its kit manufacturer, Puma, is another crucial piece of its fashion strategy. The German sportswear giant acts as a valuable conduit to the fashion industry, helping facilitate collaborations with brands like Koché and Pleasures.“Milan’s success as a fashion player is built on the fact that its partnerships appear authentic,” said Lauren Cochrane, a fashion and sports reporter at The Guardian. “It’s not just the club ticking a box… they already have that streetwear credibility.”"

        "title": "Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s sons publish unfinished novel that the late author wanted ‘destroyed’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Gabriel García Márquez’s last novel, “Memories of My Melancholy Whores,” was published 20 years ago, but the late Colombian author’s legacy did not end there.After his death in 2014, an unfinished work — consisting of up to five drafts that the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature was working on during the last years of his life — remained in storage at his personal archive at the University of Texas.On Wednesday, the day García Márquez would have turned 97, the now-finished novel, “Until August,” was published by the author’s sons Rodrigo and Gonzalo García.But, as the pair acknowledge in the book’s preamble, García Márquez didn’t want the work to be released. “This book doesn’t work,” they recall their father telling them before his death. “It must be destroyed.”Having reviewed the manuscripts, his family determined that they contained the essence of the writer who has captivated so many readers for decades. In the book, García Márquez’s sons admit that publishing it was an act of “betrayal.” But Gonzalo told a press conference Tuesday that nothing had been added that was not included in the various drafts of the novel left by his father.“The novel was a little scattered in a certain number of originals, but it was complete,” he said, as the brothers presented the book at the Cervantes Institute in Madrid.“It is not as polished as his greatest books,” Rodrigo added: “But, as we say in the prologue, it definitely has many of (his) outstanding characteristics: beautiful prose, knowledge of the human being, power of description.”García Márquez worked on the novel for several years until he began to suffer from dementia. The Colombian author’s memory loss undermined his confidence in his work, his sons said.“He never kept unpublished books,” said Rodrigo. “Every book that he did not finish and that he was not satisfied with was destroyed. So, the fact that he did not destroy this book, I think, is also a sign that it became a little indecipherable for him. A Gabo (as García Márquez was affectionately known) completely in his right mind would have either finished the book, or destroyed it.”Set in an unidentified Caribbean location, “Until August” follows protagonist Ana Magdalena Bach as she makes an annual trip to the island where her mother is buried. Each year, while there, she “for one night takes a new lover,” according to a synopsis from the book’s publisher Penguin Random House, which described the novel as a “profound meditation on freedom, regret, self-transformation, and the mysteries of love.”The posthumous novel emerged from the manuscripts thanks to the fine-tuning of publisher and literary agent Cristóbal Pera, who edited the last two books García Márquez published during his lifetime.García Márquez’s sons have confirmed that there are no other unfinished novels in storage. “All of Gabo’s work is now available to his readers,” said Gonzalo."

        "text": "Israeli journalist and film director Yuval Abraham said he is receiving death threats and has canceled his flight home from the Berlin International Film Festival amid backlash to an acceptance speech in which he decried the “situation of apartheid” and called for a ceasefire in Gaza.Abraham and his Palestinian co-director Basel Adra accepted the Best Documentary award for their film “No Other Land,” which chronicles evictions and demolitions of Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank by Israeli authorities, on Saturday.Their speeches were met with accusations of antisemitism by high-level German and Israeli officials, including the mayor of Berlin and Israel’s Ambassador to Germany.“A right-wing Israeli mob came to my family’s home yesterday to search for me, threatening close family members who fled to another town in the middle of the night,” Abraham alleged in a social media post Tuesday.“I am still getting death threats and had to cancel my flight home. This happened after Israeli media and German politicians absurdly labeled my Berlinale award speech — where I called for equality between Israelis and Palestinians, a ceasefire and an end to apartheid — as ‘antisemitic’.”Accepting the award on Saturday, Abraham’s West Bank-based co-director Adra said it is “very hard for me to celebrate when there are tens of thousands of my people being slaughtered and massacred by Israel in Gaza.”Speaking alongside him, Abraham highlighted the inequality between himself and Adra, despite living just “30 minutes from one another.”“I am living under a civilian law and Basel is under military law,” he said. “I have voting rights; Basel (does not have) voting rights. I’m free to move where I want in this land; Basel is, like millions of Palestinians, locked in the occupied West Bank.”He continued: “We need to call for a ceasefire. We need to call for a political solution to end the occupation.”Berlin’s mayor Kai Wegner said in a post on X on Sunday that the speech was “unacceptable relativization” and urged the film festival’s management “to ensure that such incidents do not happen again.”“Berlin stands firmly on Israel’s side, there is no doubt about that,” he continued, adding that “full responsibility for the deep suffering in Israel and the Gaza Strip lies with Hamas.”Ron Prosor, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, branded the comments “blatant antisemitic and anti-Israel discourse” and accused the German cultural scene of “showcase(ing) its bias,” in a post on X on Sunday.Abraham said the “appalling misuse” of the word antisemitism, “not only to silence Palestinian critics of Israel, but also to silence Israelis like me who support a ceasefire that will end the killing in Gaza and allow the release of the Israeli hostages — empties the word antisemitism of meaning and thus endangers Jews all over the world,” he wrote on X Tuesday."

        "title": "A moment for mullets",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "At first glance, cinematic parallels between centuries-old French nobility and rough-and-tumble Texan wrestlers may seem few and far between.But in addition to boasting flashy period wardrobes and strategic battle acumen, the Von Erich brothers in the ‘80s-set movie “The Iron Claw” and Napoleon Bonaparte’s revolutionary counterpart Paul Barras in Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” share a stylistic similarity: They’re all coiffed in glorious variations of what we now colloquially refer to as the mullet.“The same hair that these ’80s ‘wrestlemaniacs’ are wearing, it’s dead-on from a portrait in 1802,” said Jessica Glasscock, fashion historian and author of Wigging Out: Fake Hair That Made History.Long renowned and reviled for its “business in the front, party in the back” reputation, the mullet is actually one of the most timeless and versatile haircuts. It’s having a big screen moment thanks not only to the aforementioned biopics but also to Paul Mescal’s character in the Golden Globe-nominated “All of Us Strangers” (and then there’s Kristen Stewart’s tousled mullet in the forthcoming queer thriller, “Love Lies Bleeding”).In “The Iron Claw,” the distinctive mullets showcased by wrestling’s legendary Von Erichs — charismatic David (Harris Dickinson)’s fringed blond waves, Olympian Kerry (Jeremy Allen White)’s tumbling curls and by-the-book Kevin (Zac Efron)’s functional, choppy layers — weren’t just a fashion statement in the ring.“They’re also working on the family farm,” the movie’s hair designer Natalie Shea Rose, who herself grew up in the Lone Star State surrounded by the divisive hairstyle, told CNN. The Von Erichs’ hairdos keep errant strands off a sweaty face, and shield the back of the neck from the sun. They express the practicality necessary for the brothers’ day-to-day life in rural Texas, as well as their personalities and ambitions, Rose added.The “modern day” mullet largely originates from David Bowie’s genre-defining and gender-norm defying persona, Ziggy Stardust, Glasscock said. This counterculture sensibility also derives from the ‘70s punk movement, and was galvanized by British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and her partner, music manager Malcolm McClaren.More broadly, the mullet (a term commonly credited to the 1994 Beastie Boys banger, “Mullet Head”) dates much further back — perhaps as far as the 8th-century B.C., when similar styles were documented among both the Abantes tribe in Homer’s “The Iliad” and the nomadic Huns. The latter group’s shorn top locks were easily tucked under a protective helmet, while their long warrior tresses flowed from behind as they terrorized and plundered their way through the Roman Empire. Ancient Greek scholar Procopius described the Hunnic hair as “cut off in front back to the temples, leaving the part behind to hang down to a very great length in a senseless fashion.” In other words, befuddling to greater society, even in ancient times.Bowie and his hairstylist, Suzi Ronson, “were trying to get away from the standard rocker shag: the long, hippie teen idol hair look” of the late 60s, Glasscock told CNN. They looked to a range of inspired references for inspiration, like a photo of a ginger-haired (female) model from a Kansai Yamamoto fashion show. “Bowie, especially, was so visually well-educated,” Glasscock added. “He was picking up a bricolage version” of the mullet, while also throwing in “17th and 18th century French dandy hair.”“The mullet was typical of the sans-culottes, the French revolutionary man,” said “Napoleon” hair designer Francesco Pegoretti, referencing a term (literally “without breeches”) once used in France to describe the lower classes. Pegoretti took inspiration from a melange of sources — from historic portraits to contemporary fashion — to visualize Barras, a politician known for his pan-sexual dalliances and free-spending (if not corrupt) ways, and then styled the actor Tahar Rahim’s dark curls into a luxuriously defined, “very fancy” mullet.At the turn of the 18th-century in France, mullets made a, well, revolutionary statement by rejecting the norms of the powder-wigged elite. “Wigs were fancy and expensive,” said Glasscock.French radicals also took hair inspo from their American peers. “People from the Continental Congress wore what we would read as a full metal, 1992 mullet,” said Glasscock.While campaigning for funding for the newly founded United States in 1778, Ambassador Benjamin Franklin proudly revealed his unwigged receding hairline and shoulder-length waves — now known as a “skullet” — to bolster his pro-freedom, anti-monarchy messaging.“Natural hair is democratic, romantic and connected to the earth; the wig is aristocratic,” said Glasscock, adding, “The French loved Benjamin Franklin.”But the subversive, edgy-glamour of the Stardust-influenced mullet — which spawned the ‘dos of New Wave (see: Duran Duran; a regretful Bono) and hair metal (Mötley Crüe, Poison) — took a turn in the ‘80s and ‘90s. The hairstyle’s “shocking, weird and avant garde” associations became “cliché shorthand for ‘rebel,’” Glasscock explained. Sporting figures, and fans, took the mullet mainstream, she explained — name-checking New York Jets star quarterback Joe Namath for his aspirational tresses. (“Hockey hair” was, meanwhile, a popular synonym for mullet at the time, given its prominence among players and fans.)Heading into the 21st century, the mullet had been dismissed by the creative classes. Instead, it had evolved, onscreen and in wider culture, into an over-the-top style “telegraphing these regressive, hypermasculine values,” Glasscock said. She pointed to stereotypical mullet-ed movie and TV characters like Nicolas Cage’s ex-army ranger in “Con Air” and David Spade’s trailer park-raised “Joe Dirt,” as well as the titular “Rambo,” those “Natural Born Killers” and any number of characters in Netflix’s “Stranger Things” series, to name just a few.But, despite being historically accurate in “The Iron Claw,” the Von Erich mullets actually help subvert that trope. The big-haired, short-shorts-celebrating film is, at its heart, a tragic family story and cautionary tale of pervasive toxic masculinity.In “All of Us Strangers,” the mysterious Harry (Paul Mescal) — with a hint of mullet, soft wisps peeking out at the bottom of lush textured curls — exhibits vulnerability from the get-go. Conceding loneliness, he knocks on the door of his neighbor, the creatively-frustrated screenwriter Adam (Andrew Scott), only to be turned away.As the two connect, Harry’s retro cut feeds into the movie’s narrative ambiguity. The plot sees Adam seemingly encountering the ghosts of his parents, who had died in the 1980s, to answer long-lingering questions still haunting him in the present. “Is Harry part of the ‘80 story, or is he part of the present day?” said the film’s hair and makeup designer, Zoe Clare Brown, who trimmed Mescal’s “very neutral, scruffy hairstyle” every two-weeks.Even prior to filming “All of Us Strangers,” Mescal was sporting a burgeoning “micro-mullet,” as dubbed by the press. And in the weeks after production wrapped, Mescal broke the internet, again, by debuting a more decisive mullet — and ‘80s-esque mustache — at the 2023 Met Gala. “On the last day of shooting, (Mescal) said to us, ‘Okay, can you cut it into more of a mullet?’” recalled Brown, who had avoided a “pronounced” look to maintain the director’s vision for the film.(She didn’t receive clearance to do so at the time, so Mescal visited his own stylist for the event.)While playing Kerry Von Erich in “The Iron Claw,” White also wore his dynamic, sweeping mullet off-set — but not entirely by choice. Using a keratin bonding technique, Rose hand-blended three colors of hair extensions, which last for six to eight weeks, into “The Bear” star’s real curls. “I know it made it harder for (White) because he was the only person that had to go home in his look,” Rose recalled with a giggle. “I was like, ‘I’m sorry, here’s a ponytail holder.”But that dedication may have played an integral part in a mullet revival kicking off 2024. According to Rose, White’s lush locks have become a hot request in salons in the US. “My friend was texting me, ‘Dude, I just did three mullets today and it’s such a fun cut,” she added.As such, the hairstyle’s on-screen portrayals also portend a bright, future for the time-honored, establishment-bucking haircut, said Brown, predicting a growing interest in textured mullets for all genders.Glasscock agreed: “There’s always going to be people who want a rebel style, and can just reach into this toolkit — this visual language — the same way that Bowie did.”"

        "title": "Photo of a man posing with a Coca-Cola bottle in 1981 symbolized a cultural shift in China",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A young man stands grinning in Beijing’s Forbidden City. It’s the dead of winter, and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill. The other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass Coca-Cola bottle.Today, Coke is the world’s most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere. But back in 1981, when the image was shot by Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer Liu Heung Shing, it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary Chinese people.Liu, who was in his late 20s when he began working for Time magazine in Beijing, felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.“The changes (at first) were subtle, and unless you lived there, you wouldn’t have noticed,” he recalled during an interview at his home in Hong Kong.He had earlier photographed people grieving for Mao along the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou. It was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late-1950s China, where he grew up during the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign — a series of failed industrialization policies — before moving back to Hong Kong as a child.Under Mao, the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty, and the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. But in the aftermath of the Chinese leader’s death, Liu said, “suddenly, people’s steps looked a little bit lighter, they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed.”It would prove to be a relatively liberal period in Chinese history — politically, economically and in terms of everyday life, which Liu captured in candid shots. One photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure. Another depicted people gathering at a “Democracy Wall” in Beijing, where they wrote now-unthinkable criticisms of the government.One of Liu’s most iconic images was captured on his way into the Time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was “missing.” He turned his car around and, sure enough, a large portrait of Mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down. He quickly shot images of workers gathered around the depiction of the late Chairman, with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame.This was China “moving out of the shadow of Mao,” he said.In December 1978, Coca-Cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland Chinese market since the communist revolution. That same month, Beijing and Washington announced the normalization of Sino-American relations and Deng Xiaoping kick-started China’s transformative economic reforms with his “Open Door” policy. (Coca-Cola was first introduced to China in the 1920s but had been forced to leave in 1949, along with other foreign companies, by a government that regarded it as bourgeois).Liu had photographed the opening of a joint-venture bottling plant in Beijing, capturing Coke chairman Roberto Goizueta and Chinese trade officials drinking Coca Cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of “ganbei” (cheers). He then thought to himself, “Now where do I find a (regular) Chinese person enjoying this (drink)?”He headed to the Forbidden City, with its heavy flow of tourists, and soon found a man named Zhang Wei purchasing a Coke from a small stand.“I remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy Coke: ‘It tastes so-so’” said Liu, who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace’s picturesque pavilions in the background.The response to Coke itself may have been underwhelming, but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many Chinese people felt at the time.“As a photographer, I of course realized the significance. That this man, dressed in a ubiquitous PLA (People’s Liberation Army) coat, was one of the very first people to taste it,” he said, adding: “But I didn’t realize it would become part of the Chinese collective memory.”The image would be widely published and displayed in the following years, and he later became friends with Zhang. In 1983, it appeared in Liu’s photography book “China after Mao,” a collection of images taken between 1976 and 1982. More recently he included it in his book “Liu Heung Shing: A Life in a Sea of Red.”The photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country’s modern history, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. And just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy, Liu’s Coca-Cola photograph feels part of another era altogether.With its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign — ideas encapsulated in that most American of drinks — the image stands in stark contrast to today’s China, where relations with the US are at an all-time low. Xi Jinping’s nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the West.“I realized that the story I did in the last quarter of the 20th century (would) continue to carry relevance into the 21st century,” Liu said.“Especially with the story of China, I never doubt that these photographs are in the Chinese people’s collective memory.“Even though this memory keeps being re-edited… the good thing about a photograph, is you cannot re-edit it. It becomes an image seared in people’s minds.”Top image: A 1981 photograph of a man with a Coke bottle in Beijing’s Forbidden City, shot by Liu Heung Shing."

        "title": "What this playful photo reveals about Hong Kong’s infamous ‘Walled City’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "It was the summer of 1989. Hong Kong’s humidity – already oppressive – was intensified in the dark, maze-like alleyways of an unruly enclave known as Kowloon Walled City. Then the most densely populated place on Earth, its buildings were packed together so tightly that barely a slither of sky was visible from the ground.Searching for a moment of respite from the heat and chaos below, photographer Greg Girard found himself on the roof of one of the enclave’s many illegally-built high-rises among a tangled thicket of television antennas.He wasn’t alone. In the Walled City, the delineation of private and public spaces “wasn’t always so clear,” Girard recalled in a video call, adding that the roof was an escape for many of its residents to relax, do laundry or watch planes land at Kai Tak International Airport. “Once you get up to the rooftop, everything sort of changes. The vista opens up, and it’s cooler, there’s a breeze.”Navigating the narrow gaps between buildings with planks of wood, children would skip and play between the webs of laundry lines and satellites. “No one seemed to think of it as a dangerous place, even though there were no guardrails or anything like that,” said Girard.On that particular summer day, some children spotted Girard’s camera and approached him. When he turned the lens on them, they began performing and pulling faces. He snapped several shots, describing the final one, which he eventually chose to publish, as the moment when they had “settled into this face-off with me.”In the photograph a young girl, barefoot and wearing a blue dress, stares into the camera. Her face is relaxed and her hands are wrapped around an antenna pole as if she’s about to swing. In the backdrop, her friend strikes a defiant stance, hands on her hips, while another is in the throes of messing around, bent double in a playful squat.“I thought (the image) captured the kids’ indifference to the potential danger … of the rooftop, while at the same time sort of owning their territory and confronting me while goofing around,” said Girard, adding: “It was just quite an average day up on (there).”The playfulness of the children, juxtaposed with the jagged antennas and stark concrete of their surroundings, seem to epitomized the spirit of Kowloon Walled City, the photographer said.“It wasn’t an ideal playground but that never seemed to bother anyone — which was, of course, very much the spirit of the Walled City: making the best of, and even enjoying life in, a situation most other people would be horrified by.”Girard first visited Kowloon Walled City in 1986 while on a shoot at the nearby airport.At that time, around 350 buildings, up to 14 stories high, were packed precariously into a space of 0.01 square miles. Most of the towers were built without proper foundations or regard for safety codes.“This strange, vertical village wasn’t really supposed to exist,” said Girard, explaining the Kowloon Walled City was the product of a historical and political quirk. Although the enclave was situated in the middle of Hong Kong, then a British colony, imperial officials refused to take legal responsibility for it. As such, the Walled City remained technically subject to Chinese rule, though this was never enforced.“That allowed it to become something you couldn’t have dreamed up,” Girard added.Existing in ambiguity for nearly a century, it had a reputation for illicit dealings and was infamous for its triads, drug dens, brothels and unlicensed dentistry.But by the time the Canadian photographer made his first visit to the “thriving” city in 1986, triad control had waned and these characterizations were, he said, “very out of date.”“It might have been true at one time,” he added. But his enduring memory of the place was the community that lived there. “You quickly realize that it’s just a place where folks are trying to get by, like any other working-class part of Hong Kong.”Girard was determined to demystify the so-called “City of Darkness,” particularly after the colonial government announced plans in 1987 to demolish it. He spent four years documenting the Walled City with fellow photographer Ian Lambot, with the pair eventually publishing a book of their images in 1999.Early on, Girard decided to photograph the series in color and used portable lighting equipment — similar to the kind he used to capture celebrities and CEOs for glossy magazine portraits.“The only pictures you saw of the Walled City at the time tended to be in black and white, and they made the place look as bad as possible, in keeping with the reputation of the Walled City as a dangerous, squalid slum,” said Girard. When it came to capturing people’s day-to-day lives, and images of residents, shopkeepers and factory owners, the photographer wanted to use “a more even-handed approach,” he added.Girard documented, among much else, the blurred chaos of noodle and fish ball factories, a young child inspecting his grazed knee on the counter of his family’s grocery store, and a barber curling a client’s hair. While initial reactions to his presence were often frosty (“there was a palpable unwelcomeness to outsiders,” he recalled), residents eventually allowed him into their cramped apartments.His guiding principle, Girard said, was “to try to show it for what it really was, since rumor and myths were the only things that were known about the place.”When the Walled City was razed, from 1993 to 1994, that was supposed to be the end of it. But in the decades since, the enclave has arguably garnered more interest than it ever did while standing. In 2014, Girard and Lambot published a “revisited” edition of their book that explored the city’s legacy in popular culture — including as an inspiration for fictional dystopias in video games and films, such as “Call of Duty: Black Ops” and “Batman Begins.”“The Walled City was this jumping-off point for an imaginary city where the normal rules don’t apply,” said Girard.There has been renewed interest in architectural circles, too: The unregulated, organic construction that made Kowloon Walled City a “dystopia” to live in is now being examined as a source of innovation due to its resourceful use of limited space and cheap or second-hand materials, said Girard.“The limitations of that place certainly spurred a lot of creative responses, in building terms, to (the question of) what to do in a place that no one cares about, or pays attention to, except the residents,” Girard added.The site of the Walled City has since been transformed into a public park, which opened in 1995. Quiet and uncrowded, it is in many ways the opposite of what it replaced, providing a much-needed reprieve from the clamor of a city desperately short on public space. Open-air chess pavilions and banyan-shaded ponds surround the old yamen building, a relic of the 19th-century Chinese garrison city that once stood on the site and the only structure to survive the demolition.Inside the building, Girard’s famous rooftop photo is blown-up to fill an entire wall, accompanied by an audio track of children laughing and the roar of airplane engines. The memory of a vibrant community — immortalized by photographers like Girard — lingers.Ongoing interest in the Walled City is, Girard suggests, because of the spirit it encapsulates: the aptitude for survival even in the harshest of circumstances. “It still continues to fascinate,” he said. “And that’s wonderful.”"

        "category": "style",
        "text": "The first known piece of mail sent using a prepaid stamp — “one of the greatest leaps forward in human communication” — could fetch between $1.5 million and $2.5 million when it comes up for auction at Sotheby’s in New York next month.If the piece realizes its estimate, Sotheby’s said it would become one of the most valuable pieces of postal history to have ever been auctioned.Dated May 2, 1840, the letter’s original recipient was William Blenkinsop Jr., the 35-year-old manager of a Victorian iron works in Bedlington, a town in the north of England. Sotheby’s state that all that’s known about the letter’s sender is that they posted the missive in London — about 300 miles to the south — and paid for it with the Penny Black stamp.After receiving the letter, Blenkinsop Jr. turned the envelope inside out and refashioned it as a “Mulready” – an ornate wrapper embellished with images representing the British Empire that acted as another method of prepaid payment introduced at the same time as the Penny Black.That second envelope reached a Mr. Blenkinsop, most likely his father, who lived 75 miles away in Dalston, Carlisle and kept it, although the contents of both letters themselves have been lost.“Surviving over 180 years, the ornate Mulready envelope sealed with a Penny Black revolutionized the way people from all walks of life correspond, exchange ideas, share news and express themselves,” Richard Austin, Sotheby’s Global Head of Books & Manuscripts, said in a statement.“At the dawn of the AI age, this remarkable object speaks to our innate human desire for connection and the ways in which it has evolved to new heights in the two centuries since.”Both sides of the envelope still bear the stamped dates on which they were sent, the first on May 2, 1840 and the second on May 4, two days before the official start date of the Penny Black.Teacher and social reformer Sir Rowland Hill conceived the idea for the Penny Black, the world’s first adhesive stamp, to standardize the complex, expensive and unpredictable postal rates at the time, that were paid for by the recipient.The system was unwieldy for both those using it and the postal service, who could sometimes not recover the costs of delivering items if the person receiving them did not pay.While the stamp was wildly successful and subsequently adopted worldwide, the Mulready envelope was withdrawn after it was ridiculed by the public."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Taylor Swift might be saying “So Long, London” in her much-anticipated upcoming album but one of the city’s top museums is offering the dream job for any Swiftie.On Thursday, the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) released a job listing for a Taylor Swift superfan to advise its expert curators and explain her importance to the history of art and design, in which the museum specializes.The successful fan will have the chance to view relevant items from the V&A’s collection of more than 2.8 million objects and potentially help influence the museum’s future programming, it said.They should be able to offer “insights into the culture and artisanry” around the friendship bracelets that Swifties often exchange, as well as the handmade signs frequently displayed at concerts, the V&A told CNN in a statement on Friday.Swapping distinctive friendship bracelets, often featuring the names of Swift songs and albums or the names of the fans themselves, has become one of the rituals associated with attending an “Eras” tour concert.The tradition was inspired by the lyrics of “You’re on Your Own, Kid,” a track from Swift’s 2022 album “Midnights,” as she sings about making friendship bracelets as a way to connect with others over a shared experience.And friendship bracelets play a starring role in the origin story of her relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce. He said in July on his podcast that he had attempted to give Swift a bracelet with his number on it at one of her concerts. She heard about it and got in touch, and the couple started dating, she told Time in December.Artifacts such as these bracelets and the homemade, often ornate, signs that fans take to concerts provide a tangible mark of the economic, cultural and social phenomenon that has been the “Eras” tour, which started in March last year and is due to end in December.The role is part of the V&A’s efforts to “bring in grassroots expertise in highly specific cultural niches” to complement the “vast curatorial knowledge” of the museum’s experts, it said.Beside Swifties, the V&A is also looking for superfans of Crocs, drag, emojis and tufting – a technique used in rug-making – to help inform their exhibitions, asking potential applicants to highlight their own collections.It has already recruited experts in Lego, Pokémon, Gorpcore – a trend in which hiking clothing is worn as an everyday outfit – and Toby jugs, which are made in the shape of a seated person.Tristram Hunt, the museum’s director, said in a statement that the roles will help “discover more about the enormous, and often surprising, creative diversity on offer at the V&A, as well as helping us to learn more about the design stories that are relevant to our audiences today.”The museum did not stipulate a salary for the part-time, zero-hours role but said that it will cover “reasonable” travel costs and that successful candidates will receive a V&A Membership."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "The Ukrainian-born beauty queen who sparked a debate on cultural identity by being named Miss Japan has relinquished her title just two weeks after being crowned.Karolina Shiino, the first person of predominantly European heritage ever to win the Miss Nippon contest (which takes its title from the country’s Japanese name), announced her decision to step down on Monday following local newspaper allegations of an affair with a married man.In a statement posted to Instagram, the 26-year-old model apologized to the man’s family and those involved. She also announced that she was parting ways with her talent agency, writing: “I am truly sorry for causing a lot of trouble for many people and betraying those who have supported me.”Organizers of the event meanwhile released a statement saying that Shiino had “requested to withdraw from the contest due to personal reasons.” Kaoru Wada, chair of the Miss Nippon Association, added that the 2024 title will remain “vacant.”Despite being a naturalized citizen who speaks fluent Japanese and has lived in the country since she was 5 years old, Shiino’s pageant victory proved controversial, with some critics questioning whether someone without Japanese ethnicity could encapsulate the country’s beauty ideals.“I wanted to be recognized as a Japanese person,” Shiino told CNN in Tokyo following her win last month. “I kept being told that I’m not Japanese, but I am absolutely Japanese, so I entered Miss Japan genuinely believing in myself. I was really happy to be recognized like this.”The decision to pick a winner with European heritage prompted debate on social media, raising questions about what it means to be Japanese and the impact of Western beauty ideals in Asia.“If the Miss Nippon contest is based on the concept of beauty, I personally wish that it would be based on standards of Japanese beauty,” historian Hiroe Yamashita wrote on X following Shiino’s victory. “But With Karolina Shiino’s appearance, an (ethnically) Japanese girl has no chance of winning under the modern values of beauty.”Recounting to CNN the difficulties she faced growing up in Japan — an ethnically homogeneous country with comparatively low levels of immigration — Shiino called for a broader definition of who should be considered Japanese. “After all, we live in an era of diversity — where diversity is needed,” she said at the time."

        "title": "Revealed: How legendary makeup artist Pat McGrath created these now-iconic faces",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "It’s been more than a week since the beauty looks created by makeup artist Pat McGrath for Maison Margiela’s Spring-Summer 2024 Haute Couture show captured collective imaginations, and the internet is still abuzz.The legendary creative — deemed the most influential makeup artist in the world by Vogue magazine — transformed models into living dolls, complete with porcelain skin, pencil-thin eyebrows and strikingly shaded eyes, lips and cheeks. But it was the waxen, glazed complexions she created that really stole the show, spawning countless pieces of magazine analysis and TikTok tutorials, some of which have already amassed millions of views.During an Instagram Live on Friday in which she and her team replicated a look from the Margiela show, McGrath praised much of the beauty sleuthing and fan recreations, adding that she also “saw things that kept me awake at night.”With the products used by McGrath to achieve the glistening complexions shrouded in secrecy until her live broadcast, online speculation had reached fever pitch this week. Fueled by post-show video footage of models shedding what appeared to be a second skin, some to believe that McGrath had used a peel-off mask diluted with water and airbrushed on in layers. Others claimed that the high-shine effect was created with a product from professional makeup brand Kryolan called “Liquid Glass” — a theory the internet was so taken with that it promptly sold out (and garnered a three-week-long waiting list) despite McGrath suggesting it was “amazing,” but not “the real product.”Speaking to CNN, a spokesperson for Pat McGrath Labs — the beauty brand founded by the makeup artist — appeared to confirm the face mask theory: “Pat McGrath Labs has always been centered around creating products and formulations that have never existed before, and Pat and her team had been working on one formula in the lab for some time now… Backstage for Margiela, she combined several products for the show, including face masks (one of which was cucumber) and the perfect amount of water,” they said.This technique was “the most challenging piece of the puzzle,” the spokesperson continued. “Making sure we could achieve a high-reflective glass finish without tampering with the make-up underneath. That’s where the airbrush came in. We understand that people don’t want to mix a ton of products and buy an airbrush machine. That’s why we will be dropping one product that will give you the perfect glass finish.”On Instagram Live, McGrath and her team revealed a few of the eight products used to create the airbrushed concoction, including peel-off face masks from Freeman Beauty, Proot and Que Bella. McGrath’s team sprayed seven to eight layers of the composite mask on each model, she said, a time-intensive process to ensure their glassy skin wouldn’t lose its luster before the show.A few more secrets from McGrath’s masterclass: To achieve the “porcelain foundation” look on light-skinned models, her team blended her eponymous line’s Sublime Perfection Foundation with white theatrical paint. Before airbrushing, the artists dabbed water-based special effects glue around the corners of models’ lips and noses, both for sealing and extra (extra) gloss. The models themselves also helped seal each layer of glass skin, blow-drying their faces in a process that took anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours, McGrath said.McGrath’s creations are just the latest — albeit most extreme — example of the trend for high-shine, seemingly poreless and flawless complexions with an almost wet looking sheen. Originally dubbed “glass skin,” the look is thought to have originated in Korea as early as 2013, but didn’t make its way into wider popular culture for another four years, when high profile beauty influencers began sharing the extensive skincare routines they employed to achieve it.While “glass skin” was all about leaving the face bare but with a glistening sheen, 2020s “dolphin skin” trend took things to the next level. Credited to makeup artist Mary Phillips, the aesthetic was not just about optimizing your own skin, but also layering color cosmetics with skincare to give a sleek, shiny, dolphin-just-out-the-ocean effect. Achieving it was not for the faint of heart — or the short of time. Creating “dolphin skin” requires a multi-step process involving exfoliating the skin before layering on serum, moisturizer, a hydrating mist, liquid highlighter, foundation, more highlighter, then more mist.Like “glass skin” before it, “dolphin skin” was a sensation on social media, but not everyone was a fan. In 2021, UK-based facialist and skin expert Andy Millward said the look promoted “an unrealistic expectation of what healthy skin should look like,” and added “the extreme shiny (or) wet look isn’t something we should be striving for.”Not that that stopped 2022’s shiny skin trend, popularized by model Hailey Bieber, which was then dubbed the “glazed donut” look.Celebrity makeup artist, Monika Blunder whose clients include Gemma Chan, Jessica Alba, Kate Hudson and Megan Fox, told CNN that McGrath’s “amazing” airbrushed Margiela looks were not really feasible “for every day.” However, she had suggestions “to create something similar and more wearable at home.”Prepping skin perfectly is key — she recommended starting with a face oil before applying a foundation or base, and then skipping powder to keep the shine.“After you’ve done your makeup, you can really bump up the glow by adding another thin layer of oil over the top, or for extra shine that won’t move around as much, my favorite hack is to use a clear balm as a highlighter.”Because if the legions of McGrath fans flooding social media over the past week has been anything to go by, the trend is showing no signs of losing its luster for 2024."

        "title": "Is it time to revolutionize the toilet?",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Consider the toilet — that humble porcelain bowl that spirits away our waste several times a day. It’s not a piece of technology that often gets flashy updates (though dual flushing, seat warming and electronic bidet features can certainly elevate it), nor is it a darling of the design world.But toilets are in desperate need of an upgrade — as is our entire approach to sewage, according to the many designers, environmental engineers and sanitation experts hoping to bring about a paradigm shift.Flushing our waste is, well, wasteful, accounting for nearly a third of indoor water use in US homes, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In many parts of the world, the use of water toilets has become increasingly fraught as climate change ushers in extreme droughts and flooding, which backs up sewers and overflows septic tanks. In disaster zones, or places without access to running water, the need for innovation is even more urgent.Rethinking how we deal with waste may also present an opportunity: Our excrement can be converted into renewable heat, electricity and fertilizer.“Waste is not waste, it’s a resource,” said Arja Renell, a Finnish artist and architect who brought the topic to last year’s Venice Architecture Biennale as the curator of her country’s pavilion. She wasn’t an expert in the field, but had been alarmed to learn that some of Venice’s wastewater is flushed directly into its canals and wanted to demonstrate a circular approach to sanitation: the “dry” toilet.Known as a “Huussi” in Finnish, the dry toilet separates urine from stool and is ventilated to keep odors out — In Finland, dry toilets are particularly prevalent in rural summer cottages, Renell told CNN in a video call. Users layer the contents of the toilet’s bin with peat or sawdust after doing their business; once full, they move the excrement to a larger airtight container over the course of several months so that any microorganisms die out.The remaining material, rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, can be used as natural fertilizer rather than the usual greenhouse gas-emitting synthetic kind.The dry composting method will be familiar to those with off-grid homes. In the US, dry compost toilets have long been built as alternatives to flush toilets in rural homes that aren’t connected to a sewage system, or by people who can’t afford to install a neutralizing septic tank, which can cost thousands of dollars. Kelsey McWilliams, an environmental engineer who builds circular sanitation systems around the country with her company Point of Shift, said the need for sustainable solutions will only grow in drought- or flood-stricken areas.“There are multiple states right now where people are working on changing the current building codes to allow not only compost toilets, but more innovative solutions for people who want them,” she told CNN. “Septic tanks are great — they served a purpose. They’re a very old type of technology, and they still generally protect our wells from human waste and bacteria. But there are better solutions.”Expanding the use of dry compost toilets poses formidable challenges, however, from state- or county-level regulations right down to personal preferences. They can be difficult to install in urban settings and hard to maintain in anything larger than a single-family home. There’s also the matter of time: Waiting up to a year for waste to be safely recycled will deter many people — and the ick factor may be hard to shake.“It’s asking people to care about something that they’re biologically attuned to be averse to,” McWilliams said.But what if your poo could, for the most part, disappear from your toilet? That’s the question being asked by Change:WATER Labs, a startup led by scientist and entrepreneur Diana Yousef which is patenting an evaporative material that aims to reduce the volume of waste build-up by as much as 97% in a single day.“We have developed a technology that we lovingly term ‘shrink wrap for crap,’” Yousef explained on a phone call.Change:WATER Labs’ low-cost and entirely waterless portable toilet, dubbed the “iThrone,” stores human waste in a pouch lined with the proprietary material. What’s left still needs to be collected and treated — it’s recycable, but not neutralized — but only needs to be retrieved once every one to two months, Yousef said. (Imagine a porta-potty after that long, for context.)Since receiving funding in 2018 from the Humanitarian Grand Challenge, an international acceleration award, the iThrone has been piloted in vulnerable communities without access to safe sanitation in Uganda and Panama. Change:WATER Labs hopes to scale up the project. Last year, the WHO and UNICEF’s Joint Monitoring Programme estimated that around 3.5 billion people — 43% of the world’s population — have no access to a toilet or latrine connected to wastewater treatment or safe disposal. Nearly a billion of those people use unsafe pit latrines or buckets, or defecate in the open.“When you shrink the waste at the point of production, essentially, you do a better job of containing it hygienically, so it cleans up communities.” Yousef said. “But then on top of that you are not using, or polluting, any water.”Though the current version of the iThrone doesn’t yet put excrement to good use, future versions may be able to turn evaporated moisture from urine or feces into potable water, or convert the remaining stored waste into renewable energy, according to Yousef, who said the product will “get more sophisticated” with time.“I don’t think anyone living in a house with a flush toilet is within five or 10 years of saying, ‘Yeah, I want to give that up,’” she said. “But there are so many other applications. And they’re not all just for low-income or distressed, fragile populations. There’s public sanitation, green building, transportation. And there are so many places where people are tied to septic tanks.”In cities with developed sewer systems, radical change may take place out of sight. As California deals with worsening drought, for example, San Francisco now requires new buildings larger than 100,000 square feet to have onsite wastewater recycling systems. Local startup Epic Cleantec, which built the city’s first graywater reuse system in the luxury high-rise Fifteen Fifty, is bringing its system to residential developments, corporate campuses, factories and hotels around the state.At a new coastal development in the Swedish city of Helsingborg, meanwhile, a traditional sewage plant has been completely revamped into an innovative new treatment facility called RecoLab (which is short for “Recovery Lab”). A striking, building that ventilates high in the air, to keep odors at bay, RecoLab connects to every building in the new district through a three-pipe system that separates and recycles water containing human waste (or blackwater) from low-water vacuum-based toilets, graywater from bathtubs and washing machines, and organic matter from food disposal systems. By 2030, when the housing development is complete, RecoLab will serve 2,500 residents.“When you’re ‘source-separating’ the wastewater, it’s the same principle as when you’re separating plastic from metal — it’s easier to recycle,” explained Amanda Haux, business developer at RecoLab.“Ninety-four percent of the wastewater in our cities is actually very easy to clean,” she said, but mixing in blackwater contaminates what could be a reusable resource.As with dry composting toilets, RecoLab extracts nitrogen and phosphorus from human waste — as well as from food compost — and turns them into fertilizer pellets at a nearby factory. Biogas from recycled waste is converted into heating, while recycled water is used in the community swimming pool. As of now, the plant does not recycle graywater, due to strict Swedish government regulations on repurposing wastewater for drinking. But Haux is hoping that will change, particularly in municipalities where water shortages may become more common due to climate change.To demonstrate the project’s circularity, Haux hopes to eventually open a rooftop garden and restaurant on RecoLab’s premises, using its recycled fertilizer and water to grow ingredients. “The purpose is to raise awareness about wastewater as a resource. We shouldn’t hide it away in our cities,” she said. “This is actually a low-hanging fruit when we’re talking about circulation.”At the Venice Biennale, Renell invited Haux to talk about RecoLab in a fall seminar on new approaches to waste. The humble dry toilet and a large-scale urban sewage system may be at opposite ends of the spectrum, but they are both solutions to the same problem.“So many people get so excited about this topic,” Renell said. “Of course, the urban scale feels a bit more daunting, but even within that, there are these amazing examples going on.”“Going to the toilet needs to be quite simple,” Renell said. “If we want to compete with the with the current system, we need to provide something equally easy.”"

        "text": "Basketball legend Michael Jordan won six NBA championships during his prolific sporting career — and a set of the six sneakers he wore when clinching those titles has sold for a record-breaking $8 million at auction.Friday’s winning bid for “The Dynasty Collection” reached $8,032,800, setting a new global auction record for game-worn sneakers, according to auction house Sotheby’s.The set consisted of Air Jordan VI (1991), Air Jordan VII (1992), Air Jordan VIII (1993), Air Jordan XI (1996), Air Jordan XII (1997), and Air Jordan XIV (1998).“This set represents the most valuable and significant collection of Air Jordan sneakers ever brought to market,” the auction house said on its website ahead of the auction.Notably, only one of each pair was sold.Before the 1991 NBA Finals, Tim Halland, executive director of PR for the Chicago Bulls, requested that Jordan give him one of his game-worn Air Jordan trainers if the team were victorious. Jordan, having won, fulfilled this request, signing and inscribing the shoe before gifting it to Halland – and, due to superstition, continued this tradition for the other five championships, according to Sotheby’s, who obtained the sneakers from a Private American Collector that had obtained them from Halland.The auction lot included a set of signed limited photographs depicting a smiling Jordan wearing just one sneaker following the triumphant NBA Finals.The gap between Jordan’s first three consecutive championships and his last three was due to a brief exit he made from the game of basketball in pursuit of professional baseball in October 1993. Although, by March 1995, he had made a stylish return – leading the Chicago Bulls to the most successful regular season in NBA history with 72 wins.An exceptional player, Jordan earned the nickname “Air Jordan” because of his incredible leaping ability and acrobatic maneuvers.The Air Jordan line has been coveted by sneakerheads ever since the ex-Bulls star wore them in his rookie year – with a buoyant resale market for his range.These sneakers are not the first to have sold for a staggering sum.Last year, a a pair of Jordan’s iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s – the kind he wore to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship in 1988 – sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York.In October 2021, a pair of red and white Nike Air Ships sneakers, the type worn by Jordan during his fifth NBA game in his rookie season with the Bulls on November 1, 1984, sold for $1.47 million at auction."

        "title": "Why this artist photographed herself at dizzying heights",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Twenty-four floors up a Manhattan high rise, the photographer Ahn Jun sat on her windowsill one crisp day in 2008, dangling her leg precariously outside over the city.Fearful of heights, the South Korean photographer was beginning a yearslong body of work that pushed her to her limits, placing herself on top of skyscrapers to shoot vertiginous, stomach-dropping perspectives. In the self-portrait series, Ahn sat on roof corners and building ledges, sometimes showing her whole body perched on the edge; in others, just her legs and feet are visible above the straight vertical drop below.What brought the photographer to the brink? It wasn’t a sudden interest in thrill-seeking behavior, but a more conceptual idea that Ahn was chasing: the sense of the void. As she dwelled on her adolescence ending, she came to define the present as a void between the past and future, she explained over email. The first time she looked out over her apartment’s edge in Manhattan seemed to her to crystallize that feeling.“I approached the ledge and looked down, and there was the void,” she recalled.Previously, rooftops had always brought to Ahn’s mind a sense of ease and comfort. On sunny days, she’d enjoyed the warmth and light winds while working from her rooftop as an English-to-Korean translator, which supplemented her graduate studies at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. But as the financial crisis of 2007 cratered the economy, she overheard a stranger at a party joke about his friend, who’d lost a significant amount of money in the stock market, wanting to jump to their death.She began to think about the rooftop as a dichotomous place. “It’s a place of rest for me, but it can be a place of the last moment of life for someone in despair,” she said.For five years, Ahn photographed herself on rooftops — sometimes she wore a mountain climbing harness to keep her steady, but other times nothing at all. Though she sometimes played with perspective, she never used Photoshop to enhance her images, she said. At first, her locations were high atop hers and her friends’ apartment buildings in New York, but over time the project expanded. She secured permission for a shoot at the top of the 63 Building in Seoul, a “symbol of rapid economic development” in Korea, she explained, and she also photographed in Hong Kong with support from its tourism board.After landing the cover of an issue of the British Journal of Photography in 2013 and receiving online press from outlets like The Guardian, her images went viral.But that year, Ahn stopped making the series. The way her images were being understood by viewers had drastically shifted with the rise of Instagram in the early 2010s, she said. She had initially thought of her project as a “performance without audience,” but on the nascent social media platform, she explained, the images bled into the “continuous trend of performing our life on camera.” Internet users were also associating her images with the selfie trend of “rooftopping,” she said, where daredevils climb skyscrapers and other tall structures without equipment and pose for selfies at the top.Soon, she was flooded with emails, Ahn explained, some with positive feedback, but others critical of her work, or sexually harassing her.She decided to move on to other projects, though some prints have continued to exhibit, most recently at Paris Photo and the Daegu Photography Biennale in South Korea, last fall. In April, she’ll include some of the works in a show at the Irie Taikichi Memorial Museum of Photography in Nara, Japan.A decade later, the early self-portrait series has proved influential on her later work; Ahn has continued to explore time, space and gravity — after all, she said, she thinks of life “as a process of free fall.” While studying for her PhD at Hongik University in Seoul, from where she graduated in 2017, she became interested in high-speed photography’s ability to snap images that seem to defy physics. In two ensuing photos series, she captures small boulders and apples suspended — perfectly still, and yet inherently in motion — above seascapes and architectural spaces as they fall to the ground.Since 2021, a small retrospective of Ahn’s work has traveled internationally, titled “On Gravity,” based on the notion of trying to find beauty and meaning in the face of an inevitability, she said. “You can face it and accept, or try to resist,” she said. “For most of us, our life is somewhere in between.”"

        "text": "Slicked-back hair, a leather jacket, a cross dangling from his ear and his trademark aviator sunglasses.This is how many of George Michael’s fans remember the late, great singer—and his image has now been immortalized just so on a new collectible coin issued by Britain’s Royal Mint.Visitors to the institution’s website had to wait in a virtual line to shop for the limited-edition coins, which went on sale at 9 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) local time on Monday.The design of the coin pays tribute to the late singer’s second solo hit single, “Faith,” according to the Royal Mint. In a statement published online, the mint, which is the official producer of Britain’s coins, said the George Michael coin is the latest addition to its Music Legends series. Similar issues have honored fellow British music stars David Bowie, Elton John and Queen.Officially approved by the estate of the Wham! front man, who died on Christmas Day in 2016 at age 53, the coin was designed by Italian artist and sculptor Sandra Deiana. The headshot is set against an engraving of the refrain of “Faith.”In a statement in the media release, Deiana said she was clear from the start that there were “certain elements” she wanted to include. She added: “I wanted a detailed portrait that captured his charismatic expression—I was particularly thinking of his iconic sunglasses. It’s amazing to be able to pay tribute to his music and what you see in the design is truly a piece of George Michael’s song.”The coin is available in several different finishes and weights, and ranges in price from £15.50 (around $20) to £2,770 ($3,500).In a career spanning four decades, Michael sold more than 100 million albums, with hit singles including “Careless Whisper,” “Faith” and “Jesus to a Child.”The singer, songwriter, producer and philanthropist rose to fame in the early 1980s as one half of Wham!, alongside bandmate Andrew Ridgley. The duo split in 1986 and Michael’s first solo hit was a duet with Aretha Franklin the following year—“I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me).”The issue of the coins comes two months after Wham’s “Last Christmas” reached number one in the UK—39 years after it was first released.Welcoming the coins’ creation, a statement from George Michael Entertainment included in the media release said: “On behalf of George Michael, we are deeply honored that the Royal Mint is paying tribute to him by creating a series of beautifully crafted coins. He would have been enormously proud and genuinely touched that a national institution should have decided to pay tribute to his memory in this way.”"

        "category": "style",
        "text": "It began with a bellowing horn. Then out came singer Sam Smith, trudging onto the catwalk wearing a tartan shawl shrugged over a v-neck jumper and a functional codpiece-turned-fanny-pack. On their head, another ream of tartan was twisted with black tulle that, from a distance, resembled a flowing mass of dark knotted hair. Trouserless, Smith’s look was finished off with a pair of towering, tartan platform boots and a gnarled wooden walking staff.Were we watching an amateur rendition of Mel Gibson’s “Braveheart”? Apparently not. The discombobulating outfit was, in fact, the opening look of Vivienne Westwood’s Fall-Winter 2024 show in Paris — a collection that has proved divisive online.Designed by Andreas Kronthaler, the late Westwood’s co-collaborator since 1990 and husband since 1992, this season felt like a departure from a more popular version of the brand. In truth, many elements of a traditional Westwood show were there — the high platform shoe, the reference to 18th and 19th century dress, an irreverent glimpse of a butt cheek, even the codpieces seemed to be a nod to the brand’s history pioneering of underwear as outerwear in the 1980s. But the execution was jumbled and confused, a sentiment that was neatly — and perhaps unfortunately — summarized in Smith’s outfit.Vivienne Westwood, who died in December 2022, has long been recognized as a vanguard of the fashion industry — pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable, even at times what was wearable, and using her platform to amplify discussions on climate change and over-consumption. Her designs have influenced fashion’s greats from Alexander McQueen to John Galliano, and the label has even enjoyed a recent revival amongst Gen Z (so popular is the Vivienne Westwood 1990 “orb choker,” there are now hundreds of counterfeits available on Temu, AliExpress and Etsy).Knowing that many feel passionately about the brand, particularly after Westwood’s death, the show on Saturday appeared to touch a nerve. “Vivienne Westwood will be turning in her grave watching Sam Smith in this get up,” wrote one disgruntled fan on X. “I cannot believe this is a Vivienne Westwood show,” chimed another. While many online lamented how Kronthaler’s latest season has “defiled” and “tainted” Westwood’s fashion reputation.In reality, Kronthaler has played an important role in building Westwood’s legacy. From the time Kate Moss walked the runway in little more than a captain’s hat eating a chocolate ice cream, Kronthaler was there, and his vision is inextricable from the DNA of Westwood.But perhaps the label works best when the garish is balanced with the glamorous. The punk designer has always been, as Vogue wrote, “confrontationally subversive” but she was also a tailor who understood the power of proportion, silhouette, shape. For every oversized t-shirt Westwood sent down the runway scrawled in Sharpie pen, there were 10 truly transcendent looks banked in her arsenal.There was the opulent, crystal-encrusted corset dress Linda Evangelista wore for the Fall-Winter 1995 show, the chiseled bodice enchantingly offset by the soft, ombré ostrich feather skirt. Or the regal satin ball gowns and sleek, sexy skirt suits of Spring-Summer 1998, two sides of the same Westwood archetype that could somehow happily coexist on one runway. Kronthaler has proved he can do this, too. Just take the closing look of Fall-Winter 2020 (his debut solo collection). Bella Hadid is reimagined as a Renaissance princess in translucent white lace, puff-sleeves, a pink satin corset and a brown leather belt with a matching sword and sheath.After all, there are so many variations of what “Vivienne Westwood” means — the brand has existed for over 50 years. To one person, true Westwood means draped dresses and exaggerated corsetry. To another, it’s ripped stockings, bare butts and bikini bottoms.When a fashion house outlives its founder, scrutiny is often magnified by nostalgia. But the furore is unlikely to faze Kronthaler. “I of course noticed this wave — this phenomenon,” he told the Financial Times in 2022, when asked about the renewed interest in the Westwood brand. “But I’m ducking under it, trying not to get too engaged. I don’t want to make a parody — reworking, redoing it.”“And it’s not my nature either, looking back,” he said."

        "title": "The eyes have it: The intriguing history of kohl",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Kohl use in the Middle East and North Africa is as rich and varied as the region itself. The earliest iteration of eyeliner — which has been integral to Arab culture for millennia — can be traced back to ancient Egypt where it served not only beautification purposes but was also thought to offer protection against the harsh desert sun and even the evil eye (which can signify a curse or an ill-intentioned glance).Over the centuries, the use of kohl spread across the Arabian Peninsula, eventually becoming a staple in the daily lives of both men and women with its wide-ranging applications — aesthetic, medicinal, religious, and practical. It is believed that Crusaders may have brought the practice of using kohl back to Europe.The methods of preparing and applying kohl have also reflected the region’s diverse cultural landscapes. The pigment is typically made from natural materials; Emiratis have historically preferred date seeds, for example, while in Lebanon, cedar honey and even the gallbladder of a hyena have been used.In rural communities, residents often produce their kohl at home, or in group settings. The process involves sourcing readily available ingredients, such as plants, tree sap, or stone, which are then burned to soot, melted, or ground into powders with a mortar and pestle. Much like their Ancient Egyptian counterparts, Emirati women even had their kohl buried with them, along with their jewelry and pottery.During Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, I’ve often thought of Tamam Farhan Abu Issa, a resident of Gaza’s city of Deir al Balah. I stumbled upon her story while researching my book, “Eyeliner: A Cultural History,” which traces the evolution of the cosmetic, from its ancient roots to its modern variations. Using methods passed down for generations, in 2022, Abu Issa spoke enthusiastically of how she sought to preserve the historical art of making kohl. “Okay, girls, this kohl, I made it myself,” she proudly says in a video produced by UNESCO, a United Nations agency, which worked with Palestinian artisans to help document and safeguard traditional handicrafts. “It is an old product that is part of the heritage of the Palestinian people.”Abu Issa demonstrates how to make the pigment: she begins by soaking a piece of cotton cloth in olive oil, using old robes decorated with tatreez (Palestinian embroidery) to absorb the excess oil. She then places the cloth under an aluminum pan and allows it to burn above a flame overnight. The process produces soot, which accumulates on the underside of the pan; the superfine powder is then collected and stored as kohl in ornate brass pots. Abu Issa dips an applicator moistened with olive oil into the pot to gather the pigment, then smoothly drags it along her lash lines, darkening her eyes.Against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, the preservation of customs like kohl-making assumes greater significance in the Palestinian context. As demonstrated by Abu Issa, the process reflects not only one method of creating an age-old cosmetic, but also a deep connection to Palestinian cultural traditions, and by extension, the region’s broader history. Further, the practice embodies a form of cultural continuation — perhaps even cultural resistance.From the deserts of Saudi Arabia and Jordan to Palestinian villages, kohl is used during special occasions such as weddings, childbirth, and religious celebrations. (Abu Issa speaks of how her grandmother advised her to apply kohl around her children’s eyes upon their birth to help them sleep at night, for example). Some Muslims consider the wearing of kohl to be Sunnah — meaning the way of the Prophet Muhammad — given he was said to have worn a form of it to treat his eyes medicinally.The tradition also finds its origins in various communal practices, including those of the Bedouin, the nomadic peoples of the Arabian deserts. There, kohl is traditionally applied not only along the waterlines, for its aesthetic appeal, but also around the entire eye area — beneath the lower lash line and sometimes above the upper lash line. The application has a dual purpose: to enhance the beauty of the eye, and to provide protection against the sun’s glare, wind, and sand. This reverence for kohl is mirrored in Saudi Arabia, where some men (such as the “Flower Men” of the Qahtan tribe) wear it to honor their tribal heritage.In Bedouin society, the application of kohl is also considered a rite of passage into manhood and a marker of singledom. Among the younger Bedouins, there’s a playful acknowledgment of kohl’s impact on one’s appearance: of his heightened good looks after applying kohl, Raed, a 19-year-old Bedouin, jokingly told me in an interview conducted in Petra for my book research, “Do I look like Jack Sparrow, or does Jack Sparrow look like me?’” (In 2010, the cosmetic’s allure spurred the UAE General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments to issue a fatwa, or formal ruling, allowing its use, so long as it wasn’t to attract the opposite sex.)Kohl has withstood the test of time, enduring eras of profound upheaval, including wars, colonialism, occupation, the rise and fall of empires, natural disasters, and significant cultural shifts. It has survived prolonged periods of economic tumult, globalization, and changing beauty standards.As such, well before eyeliner was adopted as a now-ubiquitous cosmetic in the West, it was already deeply entrenched in Middle Eastern and North African cultures. In the region’s folklore, literature, song, and dance, kohl has been celebrated for centuries. The image of kohl-lined eyes is a recurring motif in various Arab art forms: in poetry, for example, Middle Eastern and Arab women are portrayed as being staggeringly beautiful in part due to their “oyoun al sood” (black eyes) or “oyoun kaheela” (kohl-rimmed eyes.) Kohl is so commonly worn in the area that girls are sometimes named or nicknamed Kahla by their parents or friends, roughly meaning “the girl who appears to have kohl around her eyes.” Kohl is also a feature of many ­millennia-old myths, rituals, and legends. Zarqa al‑­Yamama (Blue Dove), a heroine of pre­-Islamic folklore, was famed for the strength of her eyesight, which was credited to her use of kohl.Today, kohl maintains its status across the Arab world and in Muslim communities, though its use has evolved. On social media platforms, kohl has gained popularity among young women, bridging tradition and modernity. Instagram and TikTok feeds feature posts from Arab and Muslim influencers and makeup enthusiasts showcasing their kohl-lined eyes. “There we are!” says TikTok influencer “Blinkaria Kohl Girl” (who has more than 33m likes) after applying the product in a tutorial. “You get waterline and tightline.” (Waterlining involves drawing eyeliner onto the inner rim of the eyelids for a dramatic look, while tightlining is the application of pigment at the base of the lashes for a subtle, fuller-lash effect; both are centuries-old).Younger generations have incorporated modern beauty trends like liquid eyeliner into their routines as urban areas have experienced a shift towards imported Western or South Asian eyeliner brands for practical purposes. “Kohl is simple to make,” observed Abu Issa of Gaza, “but many women find it easier to use ready-made products. This could be because they are impatient or want to avoid getting their hands dirty.” Handmade kohl (often purchased from local souks or sellers) is still sought after despite these shifts, particularly among those who value cultural continuity. Maram, an Egyptian woman in her mid-30s, told me in an interview for my book, “I grew up believing kohl was a traditional Egyptian practice. When I started using kohl as a teenager, I thought it looked cool. And I’ve continued to wear it every day since.”For Abu Issa and indeed many across the Arab world, myself included, making kohl is not only a craft; it is a tangible link to her grandmother’s legacy, and to her identity. “Even if she doesn’t (make kohl) anymore, I will for sure continue to do this myself,” Abu Issa said. “I’m happy to produce something for my personal use. I’ve done something good for myself.”"

        "title": "Lusail Towers: Norman Foster on how to ‘reinvent the tall building’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Lord Norman Foster, renowned as one of the world’s foremost architects, has dedicated decades to redefining the concept of tall buildings. His portfolio boasts iconic structures such as London’s 30 St Mary Axe (better known to Londoners as the “Gherkin”) and the HSBC building in Hong Kong. Now, he’s set his sights on Qatar.Currently nearing completion and set to reach a height of 301 meters (988 feet), Foster’s Lusail Towers are poised to claim the title of Qatar’s tallest buildings, surpassing the current record holder, The Torch Doha.Part of a 1.1 million-square-meter project conceived by Foster + Partners, the towers’ construction is a pivotal component of the larger masterplan for the city of Lusail, situated 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of the capital, Doha.Breaking ground in January 2020, the Lusail Towers stand amidst a plethora of new developments in the area, including Lusail Stadium, also designed by Foster + Partners for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Comprising four distinctive blocks, two standing at 70 stories and two at 50 stories, each tower is intended to serve as a hub for Qatar’s financial institutions.“As an architect, I find myself engaging with cities in their infancy,” Foster said. “We’ve made a mark for what is essentially a new district, laying down infrastructure for future generations.”To address the unique challenges presented by Qatar’s hot climate, Foster’s team had to depart from the materials commonly used in skyscrapers in cooler countries – part of what Foster called a decades-long quest to “reinvent the tall building.”“You think so many times of the tower being a glass tower, but (with) the whole climate here and the issue of sustainability … you really want to defend against solar gain,” he added.The design incorporates advanced shading and ventilation, while the towers’ exteriors are coated with “marine-grade” aluminum that wraps around the buildings, protecting the glass from strong sunlight while maintaining the views and still letting in natural light.Central to the project are special shading fins, akin to gills, which not only optimize views and natural lighting for occupants but reduce solar radiation by 70% compared to traditional all-glass towers.“What we’ve done here is create a sense of identity drawn from real needs,” Foster said. “It’s not a fashionable imposition, it’s generated from the realities of the climate.”According to Luke Fox, project lead and senior executive partner at Foster + Partners, this shading system contributes to a 35% reduction in cooling requirements and overall energy consumption.The towers are strategically placed to create maximum shading, and as they rise their shape shifts by rotating 90 degrees.“We made sure that the towers were deliberately placed to rotate slightly, providing perspectives between them as they rise above ground level. It’s quite unique. They appear as distinct entities,” Fox said.While the towers are poised to become a recognizable landmark for Lusail, Foster believes that a city’s skyline reflects what lies beneath the surface. He says it was crucial for his team to integrate the towers into a “low-scale master plan.”They are strategically positioned on top of a metro line and at the end of a commercial boulevard linking the waterfront to the nearby football stadium, which recently hosted the final of AFC Asian Cup.According to Foster, the ground features of the plaza will be instrumental in the overarching objective of transforming the area into a vibrant public space for the future.“What isn’t always apparent from those distant views is the pedestrian experience. It’s the lower infrastructure that binds these diverse elements together,” Foster said.The Lusail Towers are set to be completed in phases over the next 12 months."

        "title": "From Bulgari to Armani, ultra-luxe branded residences are booming in Dubai",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Armani… Bulgari… Versace…The list reads like the directory of a designer shopping mall. But these are not storefronts: they’re addresses.Branded residences are residential complexes that incorporate the design and service style of their namesake brand, often sitting beside or within a brand’s hotel or resort — and a growing number of luxury fashion names are jumping on the real estate bandwagon.The number of branded residence schemes has increased by around 160% in the past decade according to global real estate company Savills, and is expected to nearly double globally by 2030. The city driving this trend? Dubai. It has more luxury branded residences than anywhere else in the world, knocking South Florida, the sector’s longstanding leader, off the top spot last year.While the number of projects in Dubai is soaring — 51 completed, and 48 in the pipeline, according to Savills — so are the prices. The Bulgari Lighthouse consists of 31 four- to five-bedroom “penthouses” over 27 floors, topped with a three-level 13,000-square-foot “Sky Villa.” The latter sold off-plan for $112 million in February 2023, just a month after the property was unveiled, becoming the city’s most expensive apartment at the time. Over the first half of 2023, the residence sold 20 units, for a total of 2.15 billion AED ($585.3 million).The designer brand plays a vital role in its desirability, said Patricia Viel, CEO of ACPV ARCHITECTS Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel, the firm behind the Bulgari Lighthouse.“Real estate of this character, this level, it is not only a nice building,” said Viel, adding that these residences have operational requirements more similar to a resort or hotel than an apartment block. “You need a brand that guarantees that quality of service.”ACPV ARCHITECTS began working with Bulgari on its hospitality concepts in 2000, designing everything from the brand’s first hotel in Milan in 2004 to the Bulgari Lighthouse in Dubai. Bulgari took a “residential approach” to its hotels, and rooms and suites were designed with a “sense of ownership,” said Viel — so the transition into branded residences was a natural one, she added.For many of the typical buyers of these branded properties, it is not their first home — or even their second — creating a different relationship with the property where convenience is key, said Viel: “The service component is extremely important for someone that is owning six or eight different houses in the world.”Aspects such as building management and operations become increasingly important, as does purchasing a property that comes fully furnished.These residences, often adjacent to a branded hotel or resort, gain access to all the luxury hospitality facilities, but with complete privacy in their living space. And for resorts like Bulgari Dubai, there’s a range of lifestyle offerings beyond the typical gym and spa, such as Michelin-star restaurants and world-class bars, which turns the resort into a destination for the local community and tourists.“The privilege of being able to ‘own the place’ somehow and have access to the very heart of the social life, to (these buyers) is important,” said Viel.Buying “instant access to the Dubai lifestyle” is a big motivator for many of the high net-worth individuals, said Faisal Durrani, head researcher at Knight Frank Middle East, an independent real estate consultancy. Dubai is ahead of prime real estate locations for second homes such as Aspen, Miami, the Algarve, and the Bahamas, according to Knight Frank’s 2023 Prime International Residential Index.For luxury brands, the move into real estate helps them to diversify their income as they make money through licensing or management fees, while for developers, the branding means higher property prices. On average, branded residences command a 30% premium compared to similar-quality properties in the same location. But in Dubai, that premium is significantly higher: 86%, according to Knight Frank.The property market in Dubai is also heavily geared towards “off-plan” sales, where buyers purchase a home before it’s built, based on the residence location, floor plans, renders and specification details. The deposits for off-plan purchases can often amount to more than $1 million for prime real estate.As a relatively young market — the city has only been open to international buyers and investors since 2002 — Dubai real estate has experienced volatility over the past two decades, fueled by speculative “buy-to-flip” activity and an excess in property supply, said Durrani.Branded residences can help offset these risks by offering a perceived reassurance on the quality and service, particularly for international buyers, said Rosa Piro, senior business development director at Arada, a property developer in the United Arab Emirates: “Buyers in Dubai have a tendency to like brands and trust brands.”Arada is embarking on its first branded residence project, unveiled earlier this month: the Armani Beach Residences on the much sought-after Palm Jumeirah island, designed by award-winning Japanese architect Tadao Ando.According to Arada, the Armani Beach Residences are priced 63% higher, on average, per square foot, than other branded residences on Palm Jumeirah, with two-bedroom residences starting from $5.9 million. Arada anticipates the building will be complete by the end of 2026.Piro believes the Armani name is more than just a branding exercise for the project. “Both of our partners are very actively and personally involved in the project,” she said, adding that “Mr. Armani himself is involved in the design of the apartments and adds his own touch.”As the developer, Arada oversees the construction and project logistics, including the coordination between the architect and brand — so it’s in the details that Armani is adding value, said Piro: “For example, on the renders that we were approving, (the Armani team) were looking at the number of waves that the curtains were making.”Those purchasing one of the two penthouses, one on each of the towers, will get to experience that attention to detail firsthand: the apartment comes with a trip to Milan, a stay in the Armani Hotel, and a meeting with Giorgio Armani and the interior design team to discuss their style preferences, “so they have a full 360-degrees experience of the Armani world,” said Piro.Durrani said that the success of the luxury property market has lifted the entire sector: by September 2023, Dubai’s real estate market was up 19% year-on-year, according to the latest figures available from Knight Frank.The imbalance of supply and demand has also been reversed, due to construction delays during Covid, and as more international buyers purchase homes to live in, said Durrani. Dubai introduced its “Golden Visa” in 2019 in a bid to attract new talent and investment in the city, and its population has continued to grow rapidly post-pandemic, increasing by 100,000 people in 2023.While branded residences make up a small fraction of the property stock, the sector is expanding rapidly, with 3,700 units in the pipeline.The Armani Beach Residences is just the first of many branded residence projects for Arada, which is already working on its next residence, to be unveiled later this year. “There is a big appetite from both buyers as well as the developers, to continue with branded residences,” said Piro."

        "title": "A tech company is growing diamonds in the desert",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Diamonds are the hardest material on Earth — and finding one in nature is comparably tough.For thousands of years, humans have dug deep into the Earth in search of diamonds, creating some of the world’s largest manmade pits in Russia and South Africa that descend as much as 625 meters (2,050 feet) below the ground.The intensive process has an impact on both nature and people, with dangerous working conditions and practices that damage ecosystems.But mining isn’t the only way to source diamonds. The first lab-grown diamond (LGD) was produced in the 1950s, according to the International Gem Society, and the technology has continued to develop, enabling labs to grow gem-quality crystals at affordable prices — up to 80% cheaper — without the sustainability and ethical concerns of mining.And growing diamonds artificially means you can bring diamond production to the most unexpected places — including the desert.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a global leader in diamond imports and exports, but it does not have any diamond mines. So entrepreneur Mohamed Sabeg saw an opportunity to not just trade diamonds, but grow them.In 2022, he co-founded Dubai-based 2DOT4 Diamonds, becoming the first to produce, cut, and polish lab-grown diamonds in the UAE.“Our idea was to bring the mine to the consumer,” says Sabeg. “Instead of having diamonds flying all around the world, the diamond is produced and sold locally.”The company’s name, 2DOT4, comes from the refractive index of a diamond —the speed at which light passes through a diamond compared to air, which is approximately 2.4 times slower.For Sabeg, having a name that relates to a physical property of the gem is a representation that the pieces produced in a lab are identical to the ones in nature.“The only difference is that we control the pressure, we control the heat, we control the gases,” he says. “The mined diamond, you don’t control it, the Earth is doing it.”To grow a diamond, you start with a diamond, either lab-grown or mined, explains Sabeg. It’s called a “seed” and is usually around 0.3 to 0.6 millimeters thick. (2DOT4 makes its own seeds from the diamonds grown in-house.)Placed inside a reactor, the seed is exposed to gases such as hydrogen, methane, oxygen, and argon. It also undergoes a pressure of up to 180 torrs —around two-thirds of the pressure at the peak of Mount Everest — and reaches temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees Fahrenheit). In this way, carbon is slowly deposited onto the thin slice.Then, it’s a matter of time for it to grow in volume.“You decide the speed of growth by using different parameters: the lower your speed is, the better your quality will be,” explains Sabeg.On average, 2DOT4 grows its diamonds at a speed of around 0.01 millimeters per hour. This means that every 24 hours, the stone grows in length comparable to the thickness of two sheets of paper.Once the diamond has grown to at least five millimeters in height, the piece is called a “block,” and there are three possible outcomes. It can be sliced into more seeds, that will be fed back into the reactors to grow more diamonds. Or, based on demand, 2DOT4 will cut and polish the gem. It can then either be sold to jewelers and designers, or turned into a jewelry piece designed in-house.Currently, the US, China, and India dominate LGD production, with the latter two accounting for over two-thirds of global output, according to Paul Zimnisky, a diamond industry analyst and consultant based in the US.Besides jewelry, lab-grown diamonds are used in multiple industries, particularly when it comes to making tools that cut through dense materials such as concrete, marble, and metals.For example, China has “a multi-decade legacy of producing synthetic diamond for abrasive industrial application, so they have the know-how and the infrastructure to be a major producer of man-made diamond for jewelry as well,” explains Zimnisky.India, on the other hand, has been a long-standing leader in diamond cutting and polishing, and embraced LGD technology to jump into production, too. Last year, the country underwent a tax reform in the sector and pledged extra funding to further expand its man-made diamond industry.Given the UAE’s status as a top diamond trading hub and its diversification efforts away from oil, expanding into the lab-grown diamonds industry could be an important move for its economy, says Ahmed Bin Sulayem, CEO and executive chairman of the Dubai Multi Commodities Center (DMCC), a global trade hub that held the very first Lab-Grown Diamond Symposium.“With the rise of the LGD industry symbolizing the intersection of technology and trade, the potential it holds is monumental, [and] we are excited to see Dubai positioned as a pioneering force in this transformative era,” says Bin Sulayem.“Sixty years ago, if you tell someone this is a synthetic or a lab-grown diamond, they won’t even look at it,” he adds. But younger generations are more concerned about ethical and environmental issues associated with mining, and are drawn towards the affordability of luxury goods, “so the industry has to adapt,” he adds.Entering the LGD production space could be a challenge, though. According to Zimnisky, competing with India and China will be difficult at scale, “unless you have a competitive advantage, or have a niche or specialized business.”Other UAE companies are following 2DOT4 and setting up their LGD business in Dubai, including Eviqe Diamonds, a part of HRA Group, which set up its production facility in the Emirate just a few months ago. Meanwhile, local brands such as Etika and Eayni are marketing their designs using lab-grown gems only.For the DMCC, the goal is to encourage the entire production to be done in-house, as a way of adding value to the final product and strengthening the local industry.“The key message we are giving to the lab-grown diamond industry is, don’t waste your time on selling the diamonds: focus on the final art,” says Bin Sulayem.For Sabeg, the hope is that 2DOT4’s creations are laying the foundation for the future of LGD production in a country that currently imports more diamonds than anywhere else in the world.“Our way of looking at what we are doing is to set a standard in the industry,” he says."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Tattoos are for life. Unless you buy a heavy duty concealer, as demonstrated by 25-year-old Paris Jackson on Sunday.The model and actor had all 80 of her tattoos expertly covered for the 66th annual Grammy awards, a process that only took her team of two makeup artists two hours in total. In a time lapse video posted to Instagram, Jackson’s skin is painted, brushed and sprayed a convincing ivory color. Out on the red carpet, her body — once a doodle-pad of colored ink and black lines — was a striking blank canvas, emphasized by a slinky, asymmetrical cut-out gown by Celine.While Jackson’s transformation was a savvy collaboration with makeup brand CoverFx, temporary tattoo camouflage has snowballed as an essential celebrity makeup technique.In South Korea, tattoos exist in a legal gray area — meaning K-Pop idols often avoid the social stigma by using bandages or makeup to hide any for broadcast performances. While shooting the Disney+ series “The Bear,” Jeremy Allen White required extensive tattoo coverage (and temporary tattoo re-application) that would withstand filming for hours in a hot kitchen. Similarly, for the 2022 film “My Policeman,” Harry Styles’ distinctive ink was airbrushed to oblivion — an undertaking that took two hours and required Styles to wear a gas mask in the makeup chair. “I’d look at myself with no tattoos and be like, ‘look at this boring *ss body,’” he told Teen Vogue.But the ability to opt out of permanent body art, even just for one night, seems to appeal to some in the limelight. In 2014, Amber Rose made headlines when she attended the Grammys in a decidedly stripped-back look. She wore a gold, art-deco sequinned Naeem Khan gown, her two tattoo sleeves completely erased — their blankness accentuated by a sprinkling of body glitter.On Saturday, Lana del Rey arrived at the pre-Grammy Gala with a couple of barely-there tatts seemingly peaking through a layer of makeup. Rey’s romantic black Vivienne Westwood dress perfectly framed her décolletage, as well as two faded collar bone script tattoos.Elsewhere on the red carpet, while Rey and Jackson were disguising their ink, Doja Cat (who scooped three awards this season) went face-first into the world of — albeit temporary — tattoos. Her sheer, flesh-toned, corset dress was paired with a gallery of removable tattoos, from an imposing chestpiece of a gothic cathedral to Romanesque gargoyles and statues. No one needed to ask who she was wearing, either. The designer of her outfit, Dilara Findikoglu, was emblazoned in Old English font across her forehead.Even the technology of impermanent tattoos has changed. No longer is a soaking wet towel and transfer paper your only option. Now, ink can be smart. Celebrity tattoo studio Bang Bang and research team Hyprskin have this year unveiled “Magic Ink,” a new light-sensitive ink formula that promises to be “rewritable, erasable and reprogrammable.” Using photochromic particles that react to UV light, the molecular structure — and therefore outward appearance — of Magic Ink can be altered by specific light wavelengths. In short, future tattoos may be as customizable and non-committal as a classroom whiteboard.One of the oldest forms of art, dating back at least as far back as 5000 BC, tattoos were once entirely defined by their permanence. Now, they’re almost as interchangeable as a piece of jewelry.Once a sign of commitment, sometimes even a badge of community, the meaning of a tattoo could be shifting. Whether it’s a temporary piece that washes away in a matter of weeks, or an inked image that can be brushed off to match an outfit, the culture of body art has widened out to include those who view their anatomy with the fixity of an etch-a-sketch."

        "text": "Archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old clay head that once belonged to a Roman figurine of the god Mercury.The rare artifact, discovered at an archeological site at Smallhythe Place in Kent, England, provides evidence of a previously unknown Roman settlement that was in use between the first and third centuries, according to a news release from the National Trust, a conservation charity.Portable figures and statues of Romans gods were part of daily life in Roman Britain. Both elite and ordinary citizens would have worshipped the figurines in their homes — or left them in temples or other places as an offering or gift to the god in question.Mercury was the Roman god of fine arts, commerce and financial success. This newly discovered Mercury was made from pipeclay, a fine white clay used to make tobacco pipes, and examples are extremely rare, with fewer than 10 discovered so far from Roman Britain. More often, figurines of Mercury were crafted of metal, according to the statement.“Finds like this at Smallhythe provide an extremely valuable insight into the religious beliefs and practices of the culturally mixed populations of the Roman provinces,” said Dr. Matthew Fittock, an expert on ceramic figures in Roman Britain, in the release.This complete figurine probably would have depicted Mercury standing, either draped with a short cloak or naked, and holding a staff with two intertwined snakes, according to the National Trust.The Mercury head along with other finds from the excavation will be on display starting February 28 at Smallhythe Place, which was one of the most important shipbuilding centers in medieval England from the 13th to mid-16th centuries."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "The face of Japanese beauty is now a Ukrainian-born model — at least according to pageant judges who sparked a debate on cultural identity by naming 26-year-old Karolina Shiino as Miss Japan on Monday.The annual Miss Nippon contest, which takes its title from the country’s Japanese name, awards the tiara to the contestant representing the “Foremost Beauty of All Japanese Women,” according to the organizers’ website. The decision to pick a winner with European heritage has raised questions about beauty standards and what it means to be Japanese.“I wanted to be recognized as a Japanese person,” Shiino, a naturalized citizen who has lived in Nagoya since she was 5 years old and speaks fluent Japanese, told CNN in Tokyo.Shiino said she has faced difficulties being accepted as a local because of her appearance, and hoped her win would change minds about who can be considered Japanese.“After all, we live in an era of diversity — where diversity is needed,” she said. “There are many people like me who are worried about the gap between their appearance and (who they are).” She added: “I kept being told that I’m not Japanese, but I am absolutely Japanese, so I entered Miss Japan genuinely believing in myself. I was really happy to be recognized like this.”Japan is an ethnically homogenous country with comparatively low levels of immigration, which in recent years has prompted authorities to push for more foreign residents and workers to plug gaps left by an aging population. The country has struggled to balance its conservative views on immigration with the need for new and younger workers, though a 2018 Pew survey showed that 59% of Japanese people believed immigrants would make the country stronger.“Karolina is Japanese by nationality, so there is nothing wrong with (her victory),” wrote one commentor on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, comparing her to various overseas-born athletes who have represented Japan in international sports competitions. “They are Japanese, and so is Karolina.”Others commended her love for the country. “Many Japanese people do not value Japan, so why is there a problem that she has cherished Japan, where she has lived since she was a child, so much that she became a naturalized Japanese citizen, took on the challenge of becoming Miss Nippon and was crowned Miss Nippon?” asked one X user, while another said: “I thought her Instagram posts were polite and well-written, and she has not only beauty, but also ‘Japanese spirit of harmony.’ This is Miss Japan.”But others questioned whether someone without Japanese ancestry could represent the country’s beauty ideals.“Racial discrimination is absolutely unacceptable,” wrote historian Hiroe Yamashita on X, “but if the Miss Nippon contest is based on the concept of beauty, I personally wish that it would be based on standards of Japanese beauty. With Karolina Shiino’s appearance, an (ethnically) Japanese girl has no chance of winning under the modern values of beauty.”Shiino’s win comes almost 10 years after Ariana Miyamoto became the first biracial contestant to be crowned Miss Universe Japan, one of several other national-level pageant titles. Miyamoto went on to represent Japan at the 2015 Miss Universe contest.Miss Nippon is not part of the international beauty pageant circuit and is unaffiliated with global competitions like Miss World and Miss Universe.The first Miss Nippon contest, held in 1950, was sponsored by one of Japan’s largest newspapers, the Yomiuri Shimbun. It was originally established to select a goodwill ambassador to the United States who would express Japan’s thanks for American humanitarian aid after World War II.The inaugural competition was won by Fujiko Yamamoto, who went on to become a successful actor. Her “dignified elegance” became the new standard of beauty for Japanese women in years to come, according to the Miss Nippon contest’s official website.After a 15-year hiatus, the pageant was revived in 1967 by Shizuo Wada, who went on to become a well-known television health and beauty exercise instructor.The contest is now operated by his granddaughter Ai Wada, who told CNN that Shiino was awarded the title of Miss Nippon because she is a “hard-working, yet humble, Japanese woman with a very strong sense of consideration for others.”"

        "category": "style",
        "text": "When Helena Bonham Carter walked onto the set of 2012’s Dark Shadows movie, she was stinking of bourbon whiskey and Gauloises cigarettes.Her character was a chain-smoking alcoholic psychiatrist, but Bonham Carter hadn’t gone “method”; she had simply spritzed herself with a bespoke fragrance created specifically for her by fragrance designer Azzi Glasser.Having met by chance at their children’s school gates in London, the two have collaborated on countless projects over the years, beginning with the 2009 period drama “Enid,” for which Glasser concocted a perfume that evoked “stale white face powder that immediately took me back to the 1950s,” recalled Bonham Carter who was playing author Enid Blyton.Glasser has also fashioned a dark blend of foxglove, poison hemlock and belladonna for Bellatrix Lestrange in the “Harry Potter” films, a chocolate chilli-scented fragrance for the Red Queen character in “Alice in Wonderland,” and what Glasser describes as a mixture of “old, cracked soap with a ‘pissy’ note to it” for the role of Miss Havisham in 2012’s “Great Expectations.”“Helena couldn’t wait to get into rehearsals with that one,” said Glasser who is famed for having one of the best ‘noses’ in the business and prides herself on elevating an A-lister’s presence through her visceral scent blends.Born in the UK, Glasser spent her early formative years in India before returning to London. She worked for British fragrance house CPL Aromas for 20 years before creating the iconic Agent Provocateur fragrance in 2000, and in 2016, founded her own brand, The Perfumer’s Story by Azzi. Now, a bespoke fragrance from Glasser can cost up to £15,000 ($19,000), though she also offers a lower-priced collection of fragrances to enable people to discover their own fragrance DNA.Her roster of celebrity clients include actors Alicia Vikander, Noomi Rapace, Damian Lewis, Orlando Bloom, and Stephen Fry, as well as musicians Kylie Minogue and Adam Lambert. But it was Bonham Carter who introduced her “secret perfumer” to a curious Johnny Depp on the set of “Dark Shadows.” Depp promptly instructed Glasser to create a bespoke scent for his own character, a vampire called Barnabas, and they continued to work together. “Azzi possesses a certain sorcery in that she is capable of capturing the perfect essence of a character in scent,” he said of Glasser’s work.The perfumer believes that fragrance helps to truly understand the essence of a character. “We’ll meet up to talk about the role, the styling, who the director is, who the other actors are, the space, atmosphere, where they might be filming, whether it will be cold or hot… There are many elements at play. I’ll then go and start trialing and tweaking (the scent) until it’s absolutely perfect. I have never had anyone say, ‘no, it’s not quite right’,” said Glasser who can spend anything from a week to three months to create a custom-made scent.The result is not always positively fragrant, as with Jude Law’s depiction of an aging, ulcerated Henry VIII in the upcoming movie Firebrand.“I worked with Jude on “The Young Pope.” He came to the studio and told me, ‘I want to smell exactly like Henry.’ I told him, you know it’s going to smell repulsive, right?”The result was a heady brew of smells evoking gout, bad breath and excrement.“It was interesting because the other actors were affected by his presence, this power and manipulative stinkiness, as in real life. Whereas Henry could just (mask his own scent by) sniffing a handkerchief that smelt of rose.”Brad Pitt is on her wish list of collaborators, alongside Julia Roberts and Leonardo DiCaprio, although she has made headway with the latter, she revealed.“I met him at (a London restaurant) recently and he gave me his number,” says Glasser, who will soon be working with Austin Butler following his visit to her studio in north London alongside his model girlfriend Kaia Gerber.But whether she’s mixing a tailored fragrance for an exclusive venue, such as London’s Chiltern Firehouse, or an affluent individual — as she has done for Cindy Crawford (a 50th birthday present from her husband Rande Gerber), and David Linley, son of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones — Glasser approaches each scent as an entirely new landscape.“David called it a fun therapy session,” she laughs. “But it is learning about the person, or history, the character, style and so on,” said Glasser who called fragrance “the love of my life.”But it’s Hollywood’s A-listers who seem to benefit the most from a one-of-a-kind aroma.“As actors know, fragrance can transform you and take you on a journey. It opens up passages and doors in the brain, working through the olfactory system to bring out emotions,” noted Glasser. “It can make you feel more confident, powerful, desirable and assertive, and affect how others react to you. Essentially, scent tells a story.”"

        "title": "World’s oldest unchanged brand changes logo for the first time in over 140 years",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "For over 140 years, Lyle’s Golden Syrup — a staple item in any British baker’s pantry — has featured a rather curious logo on its tin: a lion’s carcass surrounded by bees. But now, for the first time since the 1880s, the product recognized by Guinness World Records for having the world’s oldest branding and packaging is undergoing a major redesign.The company said its new visual identity was designed to “refresh the brand’s legacy to appeal to a 21st century audience.”Golden syrup, also known as light treacle, is a sweet, amber-colored syrup made from refined sugar that was first produced by Abram Lyle & Sons in 1881. The company’s founder, the Scottish businessman Abram Lyle, chose a logo inspired by the story of Samson who, in the Old Testament, kills a lion with his bare hands only to later discover that honeybees have nestled in the animal’s carcass.In the biblical tale, part of the Book of Judges, Samson eats honey from inside the lion, gives some to his parents and then presents 30 wedding guests with a riddle alluding to the encounter: “Out of the eater came something to eat; out of the strong came something sweet.”An alternative wording of the riddle, “Out of the strong came forth sweetness,” has featured on Lyle’s logo since its inception.The new logo, meanwhile, gives the animal a more abstracted — and somewhat more animated — appearance. Just a single bee remains, located slightly above the lion’s head.Acknowledging the product’s unchanged branding in 2006, Guinness World Records noted that the only alterations made since 1885 were “slight technical changes during the war due to shortages of materials.” In 2008, to mark the product’s 125th anniversary, then-owner Tate & Lyle announced that it was changing the tin to a gold color, although the logo remained unchanged.Tate & Lyle was formed in the 1920s when Lyle’s firm merged with rival sugar refinery Henry Tate & Sons. The company, now a major global food and beverage supplier, sold its sugar refining business (including Lyle’s Golden Syrup) to US firm American Sugar Refining, or ASR Group, in 2010.The product’s old logo will continue to be used on Lyle’s classic golden syrup tin, though its bottles and dessert toppings will all now bear the new branding. A company spokesperson declined to comment on whether this represents a majority of the units sold.In a statement, brand director for Lyle’s Golden Syrup, James Whiteley, said that “consumers need to see brands moving with the times and meeting their current need.”“Our fresh, contemporary design brings Lyle’s into the modern day, appealing to the everyday British household while still feeling nostalgic and authentically Lyle’s,” he added. Still, the redesign was met with mixed reactions. On Instagram, designer Laura Evans described the new logo as “contemporary and clever.” She added: “It cuts the fuss and gets straight to the point, whilst retaining the core essence and magic. It says more about the product’s texture and feel than the etched lion surrounded by bees did.”Others however, including several Christian commentators, were less complimentary. “This is what happens when brand managers get involved: take a story that has survived 2000 years and ‘refresh’ it (i.e. ditch it),” author Colin Freeman wrote on X."

        "title": "This photo of male intimacy in 1980s India was more subversive than it seems",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "To passersby, the sight of two men embracing besides New Delhi’s India Gate in 1986 might have seemed unremarkable. In a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace, it was photographer Sunil Gupta who attracted more attention at the time.“Men holding hands or lying in each other’s laps is not an issue — it looks very romantic from (the outside), but they’re usually just hanging out,” he said in a video interview from the UK, before recalling: “I was creating more interest than them, because I was standing there with a tripod and a camera, so everybody was focused on me.”Onlookers may not have realized, but Gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he has described as the “repressive atmosphere” of 1980s India. At a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today — and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an “unnatural offense” — the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting Delhi’s gay scene. The pair in question had chosen the war monument’s gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot.Having lived in New Delhi until his mid-teens, London-based Gupta knew this from personal experience. “I passed that place on my way to school every day for 11 years,” he said. “You just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home. It was very easy.”The image forms part of the photographer’s series “Exiles,” which was first exhibited in the UK in 1987 but is this week showing at the India Art Fair in New Delhi. Primarily shot outdoors around India’s capital, it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners, their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera.Concerned about “outing” his subjects, Gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a “constructed documentary” approach. After shooting his images and developing the film in London, he returned to Delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show.“There was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures,” he said of the India Gate shoot. “And there were other photos that were (more suggestive)… So I picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series.”The other ethical challenge, he recalled, was communicating to the duo how the images would be used — and the art of photography itself.“It wasn’t for publication, and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine, so it took some explaining,” he said, adding: “Then I tried to explain the process.”Photography for many at the time, Gupta observed, was still “a very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom.”Now among India’s most celebrated photographic artists, Gupta often addressed LGBTQ experiences in his explorations of race, immigration and identity. While studying in the US in the mid-1970s he produced a now-celebrated series of photos from New York’s Christopher Street that captured the city’s gay scene in the years between the Stonewall Riots and onset of the AIDS epidemic.Although “Exiles” presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the West, Gupta’s intended audience was always back in London. Homophobia was rife in 1980s Britain, and the photographer said he faced “a lot of hostility” at art school for making work relating to his sexuality.“I couldn’t make gay work, and I couldn’t make gay work about India, especially,” he said. “There was none in the library for reference. So, I thought, ‘I’m making it my mission to make some. Not for India, but for this canon — we need to have gay Indian guys in our library, in our art schools, over here.’”New York’s Museum of Modern Art has since acquired several of the pictures for its permanent collection, signifying the series’ place in contemporary photography. But it was not an instant success.“It didn’t have any impact when it was first shown,” Gupta said of its debut. “I think it was too early.”By the 1990s, however, interest in Gupta’s work was growing, as art made by, and about, gay people of color became increasingly visible in the West. The fact that “Exiles” is now showing in India, where he said it is positively received, is testament to changes on the subcontinent, too.Although the country’s LGBTQ communities still face significant social stigma, gay sex was decriminalized in 2018 and the arrival of apps like Grindr have been transformative, Gupta said. (“Those sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening — or maybe happening less,” he added). This modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light.“I think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before Grindr and the internet,” Gupta said. “People think it was all doom and gloom, and people jumping off buildings. They don’t seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then.”This is a message reflected in the photographer’s carefree India Gate shoot, which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight.“It just seemed very pleasurable. It was a nice day out, and I got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh.”“Exiles” is showing via Vadehra Art Gallery at India Art Fair, which runs February 9-12 in New Delhi, India. A book of outtakes from the series, published by Aperture, is available now."

        "title": "This photographer documented life as a young person during the pandemic",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "New Year’s Eve 2020 was peculiar for many of us. As Coronavirus continued to sweep the globe, usual end-of-year reflections were replaced by a build-up of collective grief. Around the world, Covid-19 socializing restrictions put obstacles in the way of celebrations.For German photographer Valentin Goppel, the uniqueness of the situation was underscored by his companions: Instead of his spending the night with his flatmates as he would do usually, he was instead alone with his girlfriend’s younger brother and two of his friends, making the initial images for what would become Goppel’s first photobook, “Zwischen den Jahren.”“For weeks before, her brother had tried to persuade his parents to let him spend New Year’s Eve with his friends, which (as a young person) I found really understandable, but his parents didn’t,” the photographer recalled in an interview with CNN. “In the end, (they relented when) he agreed to spend four days (quarantining) in his room afterwards. It was a strange thing, this commitment to meeting your friends just for a few hours — then spending days alone — but to him it was worth it.”After returning home from photographing the boys, Goppel confessed he pondered his reasons for doing so. “I was like ‘why am I doing all of this?’. I would rather have spent the time with my girlfriend!” But the evening became the starting point for a wider project about young people, lockdown and mental health.“Zwischen den Jahren” translates as “between the years” and is a common expression in Germany for the last days of December. The title is also, however, a rich characterization of the disorientated state of limbo experienced throughout the pandemic, particularly by teens and those at university.Encouraged by a commission from German newspaper Die Zeit, following his New Year’s Eve shoot, Goppel spent the next 18-months taking photos, with his young subjects frequently lit by the glow of a laptop screen, pictured wearing face masks, or meeting outdoors — the realities of life during the pandemic. In some instances, Goppel set up his camera and observed those around him, and at others he staged specific scenarios from the recent past.“Oftentimes it was, ‘I want to depict this memory, I want this to be a part of the project’, so there was a conscious decision before taking the picture,” he said. “And sometimes I was just waiting for something important to happen.” The last photograph for his project was taken in summer 2022.Goppel was living with his parents in Hanover when news of the first lockdown emerged, but by late 2020, the photographer was back sharing with flatmates, who became some of the book’s key protagonists. “The idea came out of the sense of ‘I am a part of this,’” he noted, reflecting on the book’s genesis and the shared experiences of those around him. “It then became very collaborative, working with my friends. In the end they were ‘our’ images more than only mine.”Despite this communal sensibility, the pandemic’s impact left Goppel and his friends with an altered sense of companionship, he said. As he explains in the book’s accompanying text, before Covid 1 in 10 German teenagers showed symptoms of depression; after the first lockdown it was 1 in 4.“I tried to get back into society, which was really hard,” the photographer remarked of the images he made towards the end. “You were back with your friends, but many of us felt disconnected from them, and very isolated still. That was a strange experience, because you could be in a group and still feel alone.”With open borders and international travel since resumed, more recently Goppel has been making photos on a road trip across America, photographing strangers with a new purpose, largely informed by the making of “Zwischen den Jahren.”“The Covid project set the path for what I’m doing now, and a rule that whatever I’m working on, I implement my perspective,” he said. “During Corona, I realised for the first time that whatever I, as an individual was experiencing, was important.”"

        "title": "Why the style legacy of ‘Cruel Intentions’ still inspires, 25 years on",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "“Cruel Intentions,” the 1999 teen drama which celebrates its 25th anniversary this week, tells the story of spiteful stepsiblings Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe) as they wage a twisted game of deception against Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon) and Cecile Caldwell (Selma Blair) at their elite Manhattan prep school.Grossing over $70m at the box office — and pushing its stars even further up the teen A-lister charts — the movie is an adaptation of French novelist Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’ 1782 novel “Les Liaisons Dangereuses.”“We had a very small budget (the entire movie was reportedly made for $10.5m), so we had to be really creative with the looks,” costume designer Denise Wingate told CNN.Keen to establish itself not only as a visual departure from teen films released around the same time — think “Can’t Hardly Wait,” “Jawbreaker” and “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” — but also from the 1988 film adaption of “Dangerous Liaisons,” starring Glenn Close, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer, filmmakers decided from the outset to marry 18th-century elegance with 90s sensuality.In Kathryn’s first scene, Sarah Michelle Gellar wears a Dolce & Gabbana suit paired with a custom corset Wingate says was a direct nod to “Liaisons.” “I loved that movie and wanted to acknowledge and honor it by putting some period silhouettes in with the contemporary costumes,” she explained.While Donna Karan, Gucci and Calvin Klein featured in the characters wardrobes, Ryan Phillippe was sent “a big box of clothes” from Prada for his Sebastian character, as the actor had recently modelled for the luxury Italian house, Wingate said. Christine Baranski, who appears as Bunny Caldwell – Cecile’s WASP-y mother – was adorned in Chanel-style suits from St John.In direct contrast to Kathryn and Sebastian’s mature and dark colored looks, both Annette and Cecile appear in preppy pastels and more youthful styles to showcase their naivete (in one scene, Cecile wears an “adorable” koala bear T-shirt, for example).But the period-clashing juxtapositions didn’t end with the clothes. Kathryn’s deep blue boudoir — created on a sound stage in LA — was a deliberate contrast to Sebastian’s autumnally toned bedroom, in which his desk was also a subtle nod to the 1988 adaptation. Set decorator Tessa Posnansky told CNN, “(production designer, Gary John Steele) came up with the idea to deconstruct a Louis XIV desk and add a lighted glass top, pairing old and new so we had that custom-built for us.”The opulent Harry F. Sinclair House on New York’s Fifth Avenue — named after the oil tycoon who once lived in the residence — was the location of Sebastian and Kathryn’s decadent apartment. “My favorite element of the living room set was the bold magenta silk curtains that spilled to the floor in all the decadence that the late 90s would allow,” Posnansky said.Central Park has no replica and indeed it formed the set for one of the movie’s most iconic scenes in which Cecile, who has never been kissed, learns how to do so from Kathryn.Wrapped in all-black garments with dark sunglasses and Chapeau du Matin-style hat, Kathryn’s look was a deliberate reference to one of the big screen’s most famous outfits. “I was definitely inspired by Audrey Hepburn for the scene in the park,” Wingate says. Sarah (Michelle Gellar) and I both loved the idea.”A quarter of a century on, the influence “Intentions,” had — and continues to have — is undeniable, spawning a musical and a forthcoming series from Amazon. Its styling references can be seen in noughties hit shows “The OC,” and “Gossip Girl,” and, more recently, the finale of Netflix’s “Do Revenge,” (which co-starred Sarah Michelle Gellar as the school’s headmistress), seemingly echoes that of “Intentions.”Despite being an adaptation that took its cues from a plethora of existing works, 25-years after its initial release, “Cruel Intentions” is, it seems, providing the very same inspirations for a whole new generation."

        "text": "Beyoncé has revealed she will be launching a hair care line on February 20. The 29-time Grammy winner made the announcement on Instagram, posting a cryptic video featuring apparent home movie footage of her mother’s salon Headliners, in Houston, Texas — where Beyoncé had her first job sweeping hair.A makeshift projector screen shows snippets of childhood videos; Beyoncé in a pink tracksuit wandering the salon floor, Tina Knowles dressed up for the evening, waving to the camera with her young daughter in tow, sporting a flourishing afro. “Hair is sacred,” read Beyoncé’s caption as she revealed the brand name, Cécred.Intermixed with her family’s archival footage are clips of hair washing, braiding and silk presses. Tina Knowles influence on her daughters career has been far-reaching — one of the first music videos Destiny’s Child shot was for their first number one hit “Bills, Bills, Bills,” (1999), a tale of a disillusioned, independent woman triumphantly cutting off the deadweight of her boyfriend. It was staged in a hairdressers.“There is power in community, and I saw that growing up the daughter of a salon owner,” Beyoncé told Harper’s Bazaar in 2021. “I was exposed to so many entrepreneurial women that I admired. Doctors, business owners, artists, teachers, mothers — they all came through my mom’s salon. I saw firsthand how a salon can be a sanctuary for women.”“I’ve seen how much Black women’s emotions are attached to our hair and beauty,” she told the magazine. “The beauty industry does not always understand these emotions and what we need. I want to build a community where women of all races can communicate and share some of those secrets, so we can continue to support and take care of each other. I want to give women a space to feel their own strength and tell their stories. That is power.”While details about what products Cécred will offer are yet to be shared, a trademark request filed in the summer of 2022 clears the company for production of hair care preparations, candles, vitamin supplements, electric hair styling tools, combs, hair accessories, pillow cases and four other goods and services categories.While the launch date is now imminent, keen fans of Beyoncé may recall that she teased this venture in May last year, telling her followers on Instagram about how she watched her mother at work: “Having learned so much on my hair journey, I’ve always dreamt of carrying on her legacy.”Beyoncé is not the first celebrity to recently enter the world of hair care. In 2019, Tracee Ellis Ross launched Pattern, a now-award winning natural hair line focused on “curl conscious and textured” customers. Two years later, “Friends” star Jennifer Aniston – whose shiny, face-framing layers became known as “The Rachel” haircut on TikTok – launched a line of vegan and cruelty free hair products called LolaVie."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Photographed against a city skyline in a bright, high-rise office, Monica Lewinsky stands in an ankle-length black dress, cinched at her waist with a leather belt, and cheetah-print pumps. She looks the picture of female empowerment. Of course, anyone familiar with the US political landscape of the mid-1990s knows that wasn’t always the case.The image is part of a new campaign Lewinsky is fronting for LA-based apparel brand Reformation. Throughout, she is a statuesque figure, striking power poses in a monochrome red twinset or a tailored vest and tie. The collection, titled “You’ve Got the Power,” features blazers and office-appropriate knitwear that the brand hopes will inspire wearers around the world into taking civic action.“Prioritizing people and the planet has always been a big part of what we do. Voting is one major way to do that,” the brand explains on its website.“Voting is using our voice to be heard and it’s the most defining — and powerful — aspect of democracy,” Lewinsky added in a statement. “Voting is always important, but the stakes are especially high this year with voter frustration and apathy threatening to meaningfully impact turnout.”To this effect, Reformation has promised to donate 100% of the proceeds of one piece in the collection — a cream sweatshirt emblazoned with its “You’ve Got the Power” title as a Pop Art-style slogan — to the US-based nonpartisan voter advocacy organization Vote.org. “A powerful outfit alone isn’t going to create a more perfect union,” read a press release. “But putting it on and going to the polls is a damn good place to start.”In 1995, the then-21-year-old Lewinsky joined the White House as an unpaid summer intern. (She was subsequently hired to paid positions there and at the Pentagon.) In just a manner of years, however, her image and career were destroyed after authorities learned of a series of sexual encounters she had had with then-President Bill Clinton, leading to a presidential impeachment for Clinton and decades of misogyny, death threats and social alienation for Lewinsky. “Overnight, I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one,” she said in a 2015 TED Talk. “It was easy to forget that ‘that woman’ was dimensional, had a soul, and was once unbroken.”Today, Lewinsky is an avid public speaker on the topic of harassment as well as a strategic advisor to anti-bullying organization Bystander Revolution.In her debut fashion campaign, Reformation’s styling seems to evoke elements of Lewinsky’s past. In one image, she’s clad in scarlet, head-to-toe; in another — one of the campaign’s only close-up shots — she wears the kind of blacked-out shades used to avoid paparazzi, as she stares ahead, impervious to the camera flash.“You cannot run away from your narrative,” she told Vanity Fair last year, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the scandal. “Perhaps the most challenging idea I had to come to accept was that there is no shedding or unshackling of the self that sprang from 1998… You can only try to integrate your previous selves with as much compassion as you can muster.”"

        "category": "style",
        "text": "It was the shirt that stole a generation of hearts and now it has sold for a swoonsome $25,000.The legendary white button-down shirt that cemented Colin Firth’s reputation as an heartthrob in “Pride and Prejudice” sold for about twice the original estimate.Firth immortalized Jane Austen’s Mr. Darcy in the BBC adaptation of the book in 1995. Viewers were especially captivated by the iconic shot of Firth in episode four of the series, which saw him go for an impromptu swim in a lake, fully clothed - only to bump into love interest Elizabeth Bennet (played by Jennifer Ehle) once back on dry land.Darcy proved to be Firth’s major breakthrough and he followed it up with a host of movie roles, including in 2001’s “Bridget Jones’ Diary.”The white linen shirt, obviously now dry, was estimated to fetch up to $12,700 when the auction took place on Tuesday, according to Kerry Taylor Auctions, which was staging the sale.The 1810s-style garment, designed by Dinah Collin, features a label from costumier Cosprop which reads: “CP Darcy Wet shirt.”Recalling the moment the shirt made movie history, Collin said on the auctioneer’s site: “Mr. Darcy’s ‘wet shirt moment’ was never scripted. It came about in discussions between myself and the late Christopher Prins who was then head of menswear at Cosprop. In the scene Mr. Darcy is spied emerging from a lake having taken a cooling swim on a hot summer’s day. Because on screen male nudity was not permitted (taking into account the BBC watershed and US broadcasts) – the idea of the ‘wet shirt’ was born.“Our way round this was for Colin Firth to be filmed ¾ length wearing just the Irish linen shirt (copied from an antique original) which clung to the body. The scene caused something of a sensation at the time and transformed Colin Firth from a respected classical actor to something of a sex symbol overnight.”The shirt was one of dozens of garments from the Cosprop store which was auctioned in aid of arts education charity The Bright Foundation, set up by Academy Award-winning costume designer John Bright.Other famous outfits up for grabs included Drew Barrymore’s costume as Danielle in “Ever After: A Cinderella Story,” which sold for $20,000, and the heather-green hooded cloak and dress that Meryl Streep wore in “The French Lieutenant’s Woman,” which fetched almost $9,000.Other big hitters included the costume that Johnny Depp wore as Ichabod Crane in the 1999 film “Sleepy Hollow.” That sold for just over $30,000. Meanwhile, a red taffeta Christian Dior ball gown that Madonna wore in “Evita” sold for more than $50,000.Also up for sale was Robert Downey Jr.’s costume from the 2009 film “Sherlock Holmes,” as well as that of his co-star Jude Law, who played Dr. Watson. The former was bought for $7,000 and the latter for $2,400.Among the other A-listers whose costumes were being auctioned were Keira Knightley, Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow.Bright, who together with fellow costumier Jenny Beavan, won the Oscar for best costume design in 1986 for Merchant Ivory’s “A Room With A View.”Quoted on the auction house site, he said: “My life’s work has been committed to costume design for film, tv and theatre and I feel incredibly fortunate to have been able to pursue this path. It is my firmly held belief that the arts and creativity can shape happier and healthier children and enable young people to reach their full potential.”"

        "title": "Fashion icon Iris Apfel dies at 102",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Through oversized black-rimmed glasses, Iris Apfel for over a century surveyed the world with the confidence of a woman who rejected convention and set her own style for all.Apfel died on Friday at the age of 102, according to a post on her verified Instagram page. She died in her home in Palm Beach, Florida, Stu Loeser, a spokesman for her estate, told The New York Times.The influential interior designer loved chunky accessories, jazz, work and seized every opportunity that came her way, from prestigious art exhibitions to magazine covers, a cosmetic line, a documentary, a modeling contract and a Barbie doll made in her image.“I go at it full, I’m very passionate about what I do,” Apfel told CNN in an interview in 2018. “I put my heart and soul (into things) and it feeds me. I push myself until I can’t anymore and then come back again for more. I’m a glutton for punishment.”Born Iris Barrel in Queens, New York, in 1921, she was the only child to Jewish parents Samuel and Sadye Barrel.She described herself as a black-belt shopper who made her first purchase at the age of 11, when her mother gave her $25 to buy a dress for Easter. It cost $12.95. Matching shoes and a hat cost about another $8. The train trip there and back just two nickels, or 10 cents.Those were Depression years. She was a bargain hunter, a collector, a hoarder. In 2015, she told Vanity Fair that she still wore the dress she wore on the first date with her late husband, Carl Apfel, some 68 years earlier. He died in 2015, a few days short of his 101st birthday. At the time, she described him as “a very generous man, and a very funny man.”They married in 1948 and within a few years had founded Old World Weavers, a business which allowed the couple to indulge in their passion for fabrics and travel. They flew between continents to source vintage and antique textiles for client bookings that steadily expanded to include Estée Lauder, Greta Garbo and no fewer than nine US presidents.“(Styling the White House) was a relatively easy job actually, because everything had to be as close as humanly possible to the way it was,” Apfel told the Guardian in 2015.That is, until Jackie Kennedy moved in. “She employed a very famous Parisian designer to gussy up the house and make it a real Frenchie, and the design community went bananas. After that we had to throw it all out and start again,” Apfel said.Apfel never really retired — she once called retirement “a fate worse than death” — though life was somewhat slower in 2005 when she was approached by New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art about staging an exhibition of her accessories. She was in her early 80s at the time, and curator Harold Koda had heard she had one of America’s best collections of costume jewelry.Initially, Koda asked for accessories and jewelry, then for five full outfits, Apfel wrote in her book, “Accidental Icon: Musings from a Geriatric Scarlet.” By the time Apfel, Koda and his Met museum staff had finished exploring her labyrinth wardrobe, cupboards and storage boxes, they left with 300 outfits and hundreds of accessories.The exhibition, “Rara Avis (Rare Bird),” was the first time the museum had paid tribute to a living woman who was not a fashion designer. It was a hit and Apfel was lauded worldwide as a style icon.It sent her profile soaring.In her 90s, she was the face of a Kate Spade advertising campaign, created her own makeup line with MAC Cosmetics and designed her own range of accessories, clothes and furniture for the Home Shopping Network.She had already been featured in fashion magazines including Vogue Italia and Dazed & Confused when, in 2019, prestigious agency IMG offered her a modeling contract at the age of 97, joining a coterie of leading models including Karlie Kloss, Joan Smalls, Chrissy Teigen and Bella and Gigi Hadid.She may have had her own label, but Apfel wasn’t motivated by designer names. She was just as happy to rummage through flea markets as high end stores for unusual pieces to pile high on her small frame.She had 2.9 million followers on Instagram but expressed a disdain for social media.“It’s too damn nosy,” she told CNN in 2018. I don’t give a damn what you ate, and I don’t care who you’re sleeping with… It’s an enormous waste of time.”Apfel was once asked to define her attitude to life in just three words. “Only one trip,” she said.Then she added a few more: “Might as well live it up.”"

        "category": "style",
        "text": "The former London home of rock legend Freddie Mercury is available to buy – that is, for those with a cool £30 million ($38 million) to spare.Garden Lodge in Kensington, west London, was home to the Queen front man for 11 years, and boasts features including a Japanese sitting room, a double height drawing room, a bar/library and a music center.The property was bought by Mercury on the spot when he first visited it in 1980, according to Knight Frank, which is handling the sale.Collaborating with specialist interior architect and designer Robin Moore Ede, Mercury renovated the home over the next decade, using the finest materials and his personal design taste to create what he called his “country house in central London,” Knight Frank said in a press release Monday.The Queen singer designed his home to be a “memorable, inviting place that reflected his vibrant personality and eclectic vision,” the release added.In this spirit, the dining room was painted citrus-yellow, reportedly Mercury’s favorite color, with complementary jewel tones in the cornices of the room.Once home to the grand piano that Mercury used to compose “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the drawing room offers views of the property’s garden, which is adorned with large magnolia trees and “oriental inspired” water features.The property’s principal suite is entered through what used to be Mercury’s dressing room, where he stored his clothes and stage costumes. The room is mirrored from floor to ceiling, with multiple cupboard doors.Upon his death in 1991, Mercury bequeathed the property and all of its possessions to his close friend and confidante, Mary Austin.After more than 30 years taking care of them, Austin, now 72, auctioned about 1,400 of Mercury’s belongings last year, and is now looking to sell Garden Lodge for offers in excess of £30 million ($38 million), according to Knight Frank.“This house has been the most glorious memory box, because it has such love and warmth in every room,” Austin said in the press release.“It has been a joy to live in and I have many wonderful memories here. Now that it is empty, I’m transported back to the first time we viewed it.“Ever since Freddie and I stepped through the fabled green door, it has been a place of peace, a true artist’s house, and now is the time to entrust that sense of peace to the next person,” she added."

        "title": "See inside Sofía Vergara’s sumptuous Los Angeles home",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Sofía Vergara’s palatial estate in the star-studded Los Angeles neighborhood of Beverly Park evokes an old-world grandeur fit for royalty. But in curating the space, the actor wanted to ensure that guests would feel comfortable there.“I’m not afraid to spend money, but it has to be for something practical, not just things that are there to look good,” Vergara told Architectural Digest. “I didn’t want furniture that is so precious that people would be afraid to use and enjoy it.”Vergara, the “Modern Family” star who more recently played notorious crime boss Griselda Blanco in the eponymous Netflix series, is on the March cover of Architectural Digest — one of several celebrities who opened their doors to the magazine for its “Hollywood at Home” issue.“AD began in Los Angeles more than 100 years ago, and the city and its architecture continue to charm and influence the design world, even today,” the magazine’s global editorial director Amy Astley said in a statement. “For this year’s ‘Hollywood at Home’ issue, we went inside the private spaces of some of the most innovative industry talents.”Vergara’s home is brimming with historical charm and opulent details — Baroque armchairs in the living room, a Spanish tole chandelier in the cavernous family room and hand-embossed floral plaster detailing on the dining room ceiling. But achieving the look, and allowing those features to stand out, required a significant transformation: “There were arches on top of arches, all with columns. It felt like a castle in Transylvania,” Vergara said, recalling how the property looked when she first bought it.Hoping to modernize her new home, Vergara brought in designer Ohara Davies-Gaetano, who also spoke to Architectural Digest for the feature. “Sofía articulated a clear vision for the project,” the designer is quoted saying. “She wanted a home that felt ethereal yet grounded, something fresh, clean, and bright, with lots of great antiques that added patina and warmth to the architecture.The high-profile renovations have not been without controversy, however. Last November, contractors who worked on the property sued Vergara for $1.7 million, alleging that she breached contract and mistreated employees, court records show. Vergara’s attorneys disputed the accusations, and filed a counterclaim last month, alleging the contractor sued erroneously after Vergara complained of “negligent and inadequate work.”Though there are teal notes in Vergara’s soft furnishings, threads of color woven through rugs, and lustrous gold and bronze accents found on fixtures and furniture, the home’s palette is largely calming and neutral.“I don’t like crazy jolts of color,” Vergara told the magazine of her preferred color scheme. (Pastels were also a no-no, she explained, “because they remind me of ‘The Golden Girls.’”)The interiors are accented, however, with plants and greenery in many rooms — a lively design choice that both matches and accentuates the property’s sizable grounds, which include a stucco-roof pool house and an alleé of olive trees.The estate’s outdoor spaces — or rather, their potential — was a major draw for Vergara: “I loved that you could see the landscape from every room, even though there wasn’t much of a garden to look at yet. I knew what I would do to make it my own,” she said.Landscape designer and antiques dealer Stephen Block brought her vision to life, adding earthen pots, antique fountains and tropical elements that nod to the actor’s Colombian roots.The result is a lavish property ready for entertaining. “My friends from Colombia find any excuse to visit,” Vergara told AD. “There’s just something about this place that makes guests want to stay. It’s special. I still wake up every day thinking, I can’t believe this is my life.”"

        "title": "A new book unearths a buried history of photography in West Africa",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "The dominant perception of early photography from West Africa is that it was taken through a colonizing lens. Of Europeans in the mid-19th century spreading through the arteries of the region, new technology in hand, documenting people and places under the aegis of empire. Of a balance of power that favored the person behind the camera over the person in front of it, authoring a story for Europeans, by Europeans.But what if that image were only partly true? What if that story was merely one of many – and one that conceals a more complex and empowered story that West Africa claimed for itself?These are questions asked by a new book that seeks to re-examine the history of photography in the region. Giulia Paoletti, an assistant professor in the Department of Art at the University of Virginia, has built a timeline in “Portrait and Place: Photography in Senegal, 1840-1960,” unearthing unpublished gems, giving authorship to images long labelled anonymous, and dispelling many myths.“The narrative that is told about the history of photography is that it is a Western invention, and then at some point it gets appropriated by Africans,” she told CNN in a video interview. Her book demonstrates that gap was short, and history has been obscured in a way that has disenfranchised many Africans.“We have these histories,” she said, “and what I’m trying very hard to do is recuperate some of them.”For more than a decade the academic conducted research trips to Senegal, interviewing hundreds of people, including the surviving relatives of the country’s canonical photographers, uncovering lost stories and context attached to their work. “I had a lot of enthusiasm and support, mostly based on (the) Senegalese being very proud of this history and heritage they want to share,” said Paoletti.“I was always aware of my position as an outsider,” she added, and accordingly, “never had the ambition to ‘represent Senegal.’”“My ambition is to amplify the voice of and offer more visibility to Senegalese authors, artists, and collections, and de-center Eurocentric perspectives, starting (with) mine.”The book begins in 1842 with the earliest surviving photograph from West Africa, a daguerreotype taken by Frenchman Jules Itier of the port town of St. Louis. The image doesn’t show us much, other than a few colonial buildings, a square and a couple of ghostly figures straying into the frame. Itier described it as a “missed shot,” but it’s evidence of how quickly commercial photography, invented just three years prior, spread around the world.It wasn’t long before Senegalese people were calling the shots. Unlike some other West African nations, Senegal has no recorded history of portraiture before photography, Paoletti said. But by the 1850s, a class of Senegalese women that existed from the 17th to 19th century called the signare – Black or mixed race, and often married to colonial officers – were commissioning portraits in St. Louis, the seat of power in French West Africa.“The sitters in this case have a lot of agency,” said Paoletti. “It’s not a surprise that two of the earliest portraits … are of women. It was not unusual for (signare) women to have that status, and photography would be one of the means to express that.”Outside of colonial circles, a different picture emerges. Paoletti tells the story of Belgian explorer Adolphe Burdo meeting a man he described as the “King of Dakar” in 1878.At the meeting, the king handed Burdo a keepsake called a “carte de visite,” featuring a photo portrait that the king that had commissioned of himself. Confronted by this modern African, the Belgian fled “too civilized” Dakar “to go in quest of more genuine savages,” Paoletti reports Burdo writing. The same carte de visite was turned into an illustration and distributed in Burdo’s published travelogue. In doing so, a European erased this African’s modernity.“There is shock and there is resistance,” said Paoletti – an attitude that reverberates today, she argues, in the scarcity of early African photography in many museums, that favor art in older mediums instead. “You will rarely see early engagement with modernity,” said the author.“Historically, Africa, African subjects and African objects, have tended to be constructed and maintained outside of time, in this timeless space,” she argued. “There is always this construction of the ‘Other’ that never co-exists in our time.”Nevertheless, it is well documented that the first (albeit temporary) photography studio in Senegal was set up by a Black man, African American Augustus Washington, in 1860, and at the turn of the 20th century photography was relatively widespread in the country, writes Paoletti.From the 1930s, photography found a unique social function in Senegal via the “xoymet,” a Wolof word for a decorative collage associated with weddings. Photographs of friends and family would be collected and used to furnish a bride’s room ahead of the ceremony, Paoletti writes. People would visit, and this symbol of the bride’s social circle would prompt conversation, then after the wedding the collage would be taken down and the photographs returned.“If you talk about photography in Senegal it will come up all the time,” the author said, “but there’s very little research on it.”Academics don’t know why the practice died out in the 1960s, she added, and only around a dozen photographs of xoymet survive. Notable examples were taken by Macky Kane, including of his bride-to-be Fatou Thioune sitting in front of her xoymet.“We see this format, of photographs within photographs, in very important photographs, such as ‘Sun Rays­–Paula, Berlin,’” she explained – an image taken by pioneering American Alfred Stieglitz in the late 19th century.To Paoletti, it’s evidence photography in West Africa didn’t evolve in isolation. “We need to see these photographs in relation,” Paoletti said. “We need to see how they’re connected in the world, and how the people who sit in front (of the xoymet in these photographs) want to be part of those worlds.”Today, Macky Kane and compatriots Mama Casset and Salla Casset are widely celebrated for their mid-20th century portraiture, collected by museums including The Met. This was not always the case, said Paoletti. However, an “explosion” of exhibitions of African photography (including key exhibitions in the US and Senegal) in the 1990s, as well as pivotal 1998 book “Anthology of African Photography,” did a significant job in bringing many of their photographs to a broader audience (even if some images were listed as by “anonymous”).As if to prove the riches still to be unearthed, Paoletti visited the holy city of Touba between 2012 and 2019 and interviewed Oumar Ka, a respected mid-century photographer. Ka, who died in 2020, “still lived by his old studio, and he kept his whole archive of negatives. He had these incredible portraits from the 1960s of rural sitters that I’d never seen before,” said Paoletti.It was, she said, a “transformative moment.” Some of these photographs, composed in wide shots with deep depth of field, with subjects (or Ka) in natural surroundings, don’t just look modern but contemporary, and starkly different from other major West African photographers’ work at the time.But for every photo that is found, others remain lost. No daguerreotypes taken by Augustus Washington during his time in Senegal have been discovered, Paoletti said, while some works by Mama Casset will presumably never surface, after a fire in the 1980s consumed his studio, which contained most of his negatives.Paoletti intends to present her project in the Senegalese capital at the Dakar Biennale later this year, with book talks at the Institut Français du Sénégal and University of Dakar. And after sinking over a decade into the book, her mission continues, not only for a deeper understanding of Senegal’s photographic past, but its rightful place in history.“Portrait and Place: Photography in Senegal, 1840-1960” is published by Princeton University Press and released on March 5."

        "title": "Life in limbo: Photographer documents ‘Kafka-esque’ migrant experience",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Photographer Felipe Romero Beltrán’s depiction of a migrant facility in Spain oozes with the boredom and malaise of life in legal limbo. His young subjects are seen smoking cigarettes, lifting weights and trimming one another’s hair. Other images show them hanging out in a grubby yard or lying around on mattresses.The photos were shot with the help of nine young Moroccans whom Beltrán befriended in Seville, capital of the southern region of Andalucía. Published in his new book “Dialect,” the pictures were initially intended to be personal, not political. But they ultimately spoke to what Beltrán called a “Kafka-esque” system in which the men waited for years to learn whether their residency applications would be approved.“At the beginning, it was just about this group of guys,” Beltrán said on a video call from Madrid. “But of course, I realized that I was photographing these really specific political bodies, or political subjects in this bureaucracy.”Last year, nearly 30,000 migrants arrived in Spain by sea, down from a record of over 58,000 in 2018, according to UNHCR data. Of these, most arrived in the Canary Islands or Andalucía, a region separated from Morocco by the Strait of Gibraltar, a stretch of water just 13 kilometers (eight miles) at its narrowest.The nine men, who didn’t previously know one another, were among those to arrive by boat during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in search of a better life. Recounting his journey with an essay in “Dialect,” one of Beltrán’s subjects, Youssef Elhafidi, recalls another terrified teen migrant being forced by smugglers to pilot their boat.“He did not want to drive, the fear was paralyzing him, they took out a knife and put it on his neck, threatening him to start the engines,” Elhafidi wrote. “The boy started the machine between trembling and crying and we headed north.”According to Beltrán, his nine subjects were required to stay in Spain for three continuous years before applying for residency. Undocumented and without the right to work during this time, they were dependent on the state for food and housing.While living at the government-run facility, the men took Spanish lessons and joined workshops to help them adapt to life in Spain — some of which were run by Beltrán.Overcoming an initial language barrier, the photographer began working with the group to produce images and videos. As well as candid portraits, the pictures focus on conditions at the facility, from peeling walls to basic food supplies.Many of the images were, however, staged. As Beltrán looked for different ways to engage with his subjects, he asked them to re-enact moments from their respective migration journeys. In one, a subject lies motionless on blue gym mats, just as he had upon landing on Spain’s coast. Another shows two of the men carrying a third on their shoulders to recreate the moment he fainted during a day-long walk to Seville from a small town to its south.The resulting book is thus part documentary and part performance, with Beltrán toeing the line between mentor and collaborator, photographer and choreographer. More than just an artistic decision, staging photos directly responded to the tedium of the migrants’ abundant free time.“There was an activity around taking the images — it was something during the day that (could get them) excited. And it was fun,” Beltrán recalled. “Everyone was laughing, and they just make jokes each other during the sessions.”When Beltrán began delivering workshops at the facility in 2020, he was all too familiar with the system his subjects were trapped in. A few years earlier, he had relocated to Spain from his native Colombia, and — even as a college-educated Spanish speaker — also struggled to navigate the complex immigration processes.To illustrate the challenge facing his francophone subjects, his project included a video titled “Recital” in which they attempted to read the first four pages of the Spanish immigration law that would determine their futures. “They weren’t understanding a word,” he recalled, noting that, although lawyers were assigned to act on the men’s behalf, the language barrier and dense legalese removed their agency.The opening pages of “Dialect” — whose title alludes to these very linguistical challenges — are dedicated to stills from the video. Pictures of the men struggling to comprehend the legislation are overlaid with technical terminology (“Right to effective judicial protection” reads the text on one frame; another says, “Authorizations for the purpose of carrying out profit-making activities”).“These legal procedures are really, really complicated, even for native speakers,” said Beltrán, who is now completing a PhD program in photography in Madrid. “It becomes almost like translation work — translating these laws and bureaucracies into (something understandable to) normal people like us.”The result, he said, is an inevitable sense of helplessness.“You can’t talk with anyone,” Beltrán added. “You can’t ask, ‘Who is the law?’ or ‘Who is the state?’ You don’t have anyone to approach. You don’t have any tools to make a living… The system is built to avoid you, or to deny you access to (it).”Describing the group as “just young people trying to figure out what to do with life,” the photographer hopes his project can humanize migrants’ experiences in a world increasingly desensitized to images of their suffering.Since Beltrán completed his project, most of his subjects have completed their three-year wait and now formally reside in Spain, he says. He remains in touch with some — including Elhafidi, who he says works in a restaurant and has accompanied him at promotional events for the book’s launch.In the conclusion of his essay, Elhafidi recalled how he felt when he secured his residency, writing: “It took me three years of searching and putting courage to life, until finally the moment came, after being cold, scared, hungry and the most difficult thing, my mother’s tears… I got it,” he wrote.“I got the papers. Now after getting it I have another look at life, I finally feel that I have the opportunity to be whoever I want to be.”“They’re building their lives,” Beltrán said of those, including Elhafidi, who have secured residency. “Fortunately, they now can go back to Morocco to visit and see their families.”“Dialect,” published by Loose Joints, is available now."

Marsh, representing the state of Colorado, is the first active-duty Air Force officer ever to receive the national title.Ellie Breaux of Texas placed as first-runner-up.Fifty-one contestants participated in the event, representing all 50 US states, as well as the District of Columbia.The pageant followed three nights of preliminary competitions. At the beginning of the main event, the field was narrowed to 11 semi-finalists — 10 chosen by the preliminary judges, and one by a public vote open to pageant fans and followers across the United States.These 11 women then participated in four rounds of competition — a fitness showcase (a runway walk in rhinestone-embellished athleisure); a “hot topics” discussion round, which replaced the pageant’s more traditional Q&A with a disparate set of talking points; a talent performance; and an evening gown presentation — before the five finalists were announced. Marsh and Breaux, who were followed in the final rankings by second-, third- and fourth-runners-up, Cydney Bridges of Indiana, Mallory Hudson of Kentucky and Caroline Parente of Rhode Island, respectively.In the somewhat disparate discussion round, which broached topics including terrorism, technology, nutrition and climate change, Marsh responded to the topic of “drugs in America” by recalling her late mother’s battle with pancreatic cancer. In the talent round, she presented a spoken-word piece centered on receiving a pilot’s license at 16.The five finalists then faced an additional question about their goals as Miss America. Marsh responded by highlighting her military credentials as an embodiment of her commitment to learning and leading “with passion.”She succeeds the 2023 Miss America, Grace Stanke of Wisconsin.The 2024 Miss America’s Teen pageant, which took place Saturday night, crowned 16-year-old Hanley House, of North Carolina."

        "text": "A new version of Italian artist Michelangelo Pistoletto’s “Venus of the Rags” has been unveiled in Naples after the original was destroyed in a suspected arson attack.The artwork—a statue of Venus, the Roman goddess of love, sex, beauty and fertility, and a heap of rags—stands in the Italian city’s Piazza Municipio once again following a ceremony Wednesday.The inauguration was attended by Pistoletto, Naples mayor Gaetano Manfredi and various other local officials, according to a media release from the local council, which called the work “a symbol of resistance, hope and rebirth.”A crowdfunding campaign was set up to rebuild the artwork after the fire in July 2023, but Pistoletto decided to donate the money raised to two local charities.“I am happy that the reconstruction of the ‘Venus of the Rags’ in Piazza Municipio brings care, benefit and salvation to many people who need it,” the artist, who has donated the work to the city, said in the media statement.The new version is “apparently identical” to the one that was burned, councillor Vincenzo Trione said in the statement.“The new Venus, however, is supported by the wreck that survived the fire on 12 July, which has undergone careful restoration and restoration work. Like a phoenix risen from its ashes,” he said.The work will be displayed in Piazza Municipio for three months before being moved to a permanent spot.Pistoletto first made the “Venus of the Rags” in 1967. There are several versions of the piece on display in museums and galleries around the world.“Considered one of the most iconic works of the 20th century and one of the artist’s most emblematic, the ‘Venus of the Rags’ stages the contrast between the still beauty of the classical tradition and the transience of the contemporary,” the local government said in a press release in June 2023."

        "title": "Photographer steps inside Vietnam’s shadowy ‘click farms’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Jack Latham was on a mission to photograph farms in Vietnam — not the country’s sprawling plantations or rice terraces but its “click farms.”Last year, the British photographer spent a month in the capital Hanoi documenting some of the shadowy enterprises that help clients artificially boost online traffic and social media engagement in the hope of manipulating algorithms and user perceptions. The resulting images, which feature in his new book “Beggar’s Honey,” provide rare insight into the workshops that hire low-paid workers to cultivate likes, comments and shares for businesses and individuals globally.“When most people are on social media, they want nothing but attention — they’re begging for it,” Latham said in a phone interview, explaining his book’s title. “With social media, our attention is a product for advertisers and marketers.”In the 2000s, the growing popularity of social media sites — including Facebook and Twitter, now called X — created a new market for well-curated digital profiles, with companies and brands vying to maximize visibility and influence. Though it is unclear when click farms began proliferating, tech experts warned about “virtual gang masters” operating them from low-income countries as early as 2007.In the following decades, click farms exploded in number — particularly in Asia, where they can be found across India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines and beyond. Regulations have often failed to keep pace: While some countries, like China, have attempted to crack down on operations (the China Advertising Association banned the use of click farms for commercial gain in 2020), they continue to flourish around the continent, especially in places where low labor and electricity costs make it affordable to power hundreds of devices simultaneously.Latham’s project took him to five click farms in Vietnam. (The click farmers he hoped to photograph in Hong Kong “got cold feet,” he said, and pandemic-related travel restrictions dashed his plans to document the practice in mainland China). On the outskirts of Hanoi, Latham visited workshops operating from residential properties and hotels.Some had a traditional setup with hundreds of manually operated phones, while others used a newer, compact method called “box farming” — a phrase used by the click farmers Latham visited — where several phones, without screens and batteries, are wired together and linked to a computer interface.Latham said one of the click farms he visited was a family-run business, though the others appeared more like a tech companies. Most workers were in their 20s and 30s, he added.“They all looked like Silicon Valley startups,” he said. “There was a tremendous amount of hardware … whole walls of phones.”Some of Latham’s photos depict — albeit anonymously — workers tasked with harvesting clicks. In one image, a man is seen stationed amid a sea of gadgets in what appears to be a lonely and monotonous task.“It only takes one person to control large amounts of phones,” Latham said. “One person can very quickly (do the work of) 10,000. It’s both solitary and crowded.”At the farms Lathan visited, individuals were usually in charge of a particular social media platforms. For instance, one “farmer” would be responsible for mass posting and commenting on Facebook accounts, or setting up YouTube platforms where they post and watch videos on loop. The photographer added that TikTok is now the most popular platform at the click farms he visited.The click farmers Latham spoke to mostly advertised their services online for less than one cent per click, view or interaction. And despite the fraudulent nature of their tasks, they seemed to treat it like just another job, the photographer said.‘There was an understanding they were just providing a service,” he added. “There wasn’t a shadiness. What they’re offering is shortcuts.”Across its 134 pages, “Beggar’s Honey” includes a collection of abstract photographs — some seductive, others contemplative — depicting videos that appeared on Latham’s TikTok feed. He included them in the book to represent the kind of content he saw being boosted by click farms.But many of his photos focus on the hardware used to manipulate social media —webs of wires, phones and computers.“A lot of my work is about conspiracies,” Latham said. ” Trying to ‘document the machines used to spread disinformation’ is the tagline of the project. The bigger picture is often the thing we don’t see.”Click farms around the world are also used to amplify political messages and spread disinformation during elections. In 2016, Cambodia’s then-prime minister Hun Sen was accused of buying Facebook friends and likes, which according to the BBC he denied, while shadowy operations in North Macedonia were found to have spread pro-Donald Trump posts and articles during that year’s US presidential election.While researching, Latham said he found that algorithms — a topic of his previous book, “Latent Bloom” — often recommended videos that he said got increasingly “extreme” with each click.“If you only digest a diet of that, it’s a matter of time you become diabetically conspiratorial,” he said. “The spreading of disinformation is the worst thing. It happens in your pocket, not newspapers, and it’s terrifying that it’s tailored to your kind of neurosis.”Hoping to raise awareness of the phenomenon and its dangers, Latham is planning to exhibit his own home version of a click farm — a small box with several phones attached to a computer interface — at the 2024 Images Vevey Festival in Switzerland. He bought the gadget in Vietnam for the equivalent of about $1,000 and has occasionally experimented with it on his social media accounts.On Instagram, Latham’s photos usually attract anywhere from a few dozen to couple hundred likes. But when he deployed his personal click farm to announce his latest book, the post generated more than 6,600 likes. The photographer wants people to realize that there’s more to what they see on social media — and that metrics aren’t a measurement of authenticity.“When people are better equipped with knowledge of how things work, they can make more informed decisions,” he said.“Beggar’s Honey,” co-published by Here Press and Images Vevey, is available now."

        "title": "The landscape photographer surveying the ‘liminal spaces’ of war — and peace",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "An-My Lê doesn’t identify as a war photographer. Though her body of work across the last three decades deals largely with themes of human conflict, it’s not the act of combat itself she is most preoccupied with. For Lê, who came to the United States from Vietnam as a teenage refugee in 1975, and is now based in New York, it’s rather the ambiguous “liminal spaces” of military existence that hold her focus, offering a psychological vantage point beyond the machinery — and mythology — of war.Take Lê’s “29 Palms (2003-4),” a black-and-white series shot at a Mojave Desert camp where a battalion of US Marines were conducting training ahead of deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan. Through Lê’s lens, the arid California landscape evokes the nationalism of both American expansionism as well as Hollywood’s reenactments of wars abroad. Her images capture the rising smoke of artillery fire and bolts of lights descending from air bombs during war games, barracks scrawled in faux Arabic to mimic scenes in the field, and young soldiers role-playing — some American heroes, others enemy insurgents.“It doesn’t have the same explosive, devastating quality of real combat,” Lê said of the series. “It’s much quieter. It provides a space that is a little more meditative… You can think about the reasons we are going to war — and about the consequences.”Some 20 years since the completion of “29 Palms,” Lê is currently exhibiting her first-ever New York museum survey, “Between Two Rivers,” at the Museum of Modern Art. The show comprises other earlier works like Lê’s study of a Hudson River quarry, “Trap Rock (2006-7),” along with her ongoing series “Silent General” and a new cyclorama — a series of connected panels arranged into a 360-degree view — titled “Fourteen Views (2023),” which was created for the exhibit.Drawing parallels between the Mekong and Mississippi, “Between Two Rivers” presents Lê’s photography in the context of the world’s water ways — what Lê describes as “fluvial journeys” that represent the ceaseless, circular flow of human history.“It’s the notion of multiple rivers, multiple sources of culture and information, things changing, things never staying still… It’s about borders and delineation,” Lê explained in an interview with CNN, adding that, to her, rivers also take on a personal meaning. “The river is the foundational source of many of Vietnam’s myths and origin stories, and so it just seemed really fitting to me.”Extending this sweeping conceit to oceans, Lê’s series “Events Ashore (2005-14)” is a nuanced look at the daily lives of non-combat personnel aboard maritime vessels across seven continents — from scientific research missions in the Arctic to humanitarian and peacekeeping exercises in Asia and Africa.“Events Ashore” is a narrative told both close-up, through portraits of non-military personnel — predominantly women, whom Lê says interest her more in male-dominated spaces — as well as in zoomed out scenes of marine vessels.“Growing up, the idea of exploration, the idea of conquering or being conquered somehow always involved the ocean and ships at sea,” she told CNN.Embedding herself onboard battleships, aircraft carriers and submarines, among others, Lê’s work showcases the vast network of power structures seemingly needed to maintain the veneer of control in peacetime. (She was required to obtain clearance from the supervisor of each mission, take safety courses, and be chaperoned by an official escort while shooting.)Lê’s gaze lingers often on interpersonal dynamics of collaboration and colonization; from three off-duty sailors looming over a single Vietnamese woman playing pool to a sea of camouflage-clad marines facing a lone Ghanaian man during a meeting about flood emergencies.There are also the intrapersonal dynamics: in conversations with her American subjects, Lê said she often inquired about their reasons for joining the military.“I didn’t know, for example, that a lot of Americans join the military for economic reasons… a way for them to get out of where they came from. Or it’s a family thing,” Lê said. “But if the President decides we’re going to war, that’s it. They have given up their right to decide. I sometimes felt a lot of empathy for the individual soldiers. And that’s a complicated emotion, being fully cognizant of the devastation that was inflicted on Vietnam and its people.”“I was interested in exploring the US military-industrial complex in all of its contradictions — so much will to do good but also many blunders,” Lê continued. “I was willing to try to explore the subject in all its nuances and complexities.”Lê’s work doesn’t impose any particular morality on the viewer; instead, she intentionally utilizes distance and scale to convey a complexity often overlooked. Referencing a film she created to accompany “29 Palms,” she noted that her practice is often interpreted differently by viewers across the political spectrum.“In the film, the young Marines look like protagonists — handsome, young, and full of future potential,” she said. “Some liberal people say this is an incredible anti-war statement, because it shows how vulnerable they are… how we’re throwing away the future by sending them to war. Conservatives see the same film and think, ‘Oh, these guys are just heroic. This is the face of the military that we need to show overseas to make a point about democracy.’”In many respects, Lê might be better described as a landscape photographer: The toll of war and the cost of military intervention are subtexts within her images, but the true subject is often the environment itself. Citing the seascapes of 19th-century photographer Gustave Le Gray as inspiration, Lê explained that her primary aim is not making conventionally beautiful images — though her photos often are — but rather to capture the sublime, and by extension the ambiguous.This tension is perhaps most apparent in “Manning the Rail, USS Tortuga, Java Sea (2010),” which portrays sailors and soldiers on a Navy landing ship surveying an array of smaller vessels and the horizon beyond. It’s both majestic and foreboding, as if the people in the photo are bracing for the threat of danger ahead.“You really start thinking about the sublime when you’re at sea, coming into contact with the weather and the air and the forces of nature,” Lê said of the image. “(It’s) something that’s ineffable as experienced from the perspective of American military power. It felt like a mirage, actually. And I am always interested in the disparity of power and what that means.”The breadth of Lê’s body of work is showcased holistically in the aforementioned cyclorama “Fourteen Views.” For this piece, Lê took inspiration from 19th-century European panoramas, which she said were typically painted “as a propaganda tool,” to showcase foreign conquests and justify imperialism in the pre-cinema era. But rather than show one cohesive image, Lê used the horizon lines of different rivers and waterways across the world in order to portray a shared experience across space and time — from a bridge over the Mekong River to the banks of Bayou St. John in New Orleans.“It’s a kind of fluvial journey that starts somewhere and ends somewhere else,” she explained. “But you basically end up where you start. It’s a web of connectivity between different times and different cultures.”While the universality of this theme is largely apparent across her practice, Lê is perhaps most incisive when she applies her own personal history — the way her own life has been marked by French colonialism and American imperialism — to her inquiries about war, myth and empire.“There’s a sense of confusion because the images come from what seem like disparate locations — I think it’s the way a lot of dislocated refugees and immigrants feel. We are torn in different directions. We have different allegiances and histories,” she concluded. “(But) I think it also points toward a future that is getting more and more global — and hopefully more equitable.”"

        "title": "How this photographer makes sublime landscapes of the American West",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "The first time Reuben Wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast, open skies of the American West, he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus.The British visual artist, now based in Chicago, has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting, enhancing craggy peaks with halos, or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity. But for a long time, art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth-pop band Ladytron.“(Photography) started as an all-consuming hobby,” he explained in a phone interview. But when Ladytron took a break in 2011 after five studio albums (they released a self-titled sixth album in 2019, and the seventh, “Time’s Arrow,” this month), he began a new career from scratch. “While the others did their own solo projects, making their own music and releasing their own albums, this was my solo project.”Wu’s imagery takes a classic photographer’s combination — light and landscape — and marries the two in transformative ways. He often begins with dusky evening light or the ink-black shadows of night, then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom-built consumer drones. In one image, a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky. In a different motion piece, Wu simulated an electrical storm in Goblin Valley, Utah, but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning.The artist’s 2018 photo book “Lux Noctis” is in the collections of the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and he has shot commercial work for Apple, Audi and Google as well as the DJ and music producer Zedd. Last summer, Wu revealed a colossal project for National Geographic: a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about Stonehenge, which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones. In November, one of his NFTs, a 4K video loop titled “An Irresistible Force,” outperformed its high estimate by over 25% during an auction at Sotheby’s Hong Kong, selling at 441,000 HKD (about $56,500).“I couldn’t have dreamed of where I am now,” Wu said. “I just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography.”Wu has always been drawn to wild, remote places where he could find solitude. His parents immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK before he was born, and he grew up an introverted child in Liverpool, he said, who didn’t quite click with school. He was fascinated with science-fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday, such as Steven Spielberg’s “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” which featured Wyoming’s Devils Tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact. (Unfamiliar with American topography, he initially thought the butte, a national monument, was a fictional geological entity, he explained with a laugh).The film’s visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work. “(It’s) cemented into my brain, the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky, kind of like search lights on very ordinary (American) landscapes,” he said.He embarked on his first cross-country photography trip across the US in 2013, around a decade after getting a taste on the road with Ladytron. The resulting series featured vivid depictions of the Grand Canyon and South Dakota Badlands, as well as a time-lapse image of Devils Tower at night among star trails.Two years later, Wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot.“I flew the drone up above some cliffs, and I was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape,” he explained. It made the cliffs glow, reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially.Wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project. The first iteration, he said, which he used when the technology was still nascent, was a “massive” eight-rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time. The next used a 3D-printed bracket with an LED hot light, but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air. The tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room, with a half hour to fly out, capture images and return to him, but he’s had to learn to work within the bounds of each set-up.“I’m a lot less anxious now, because I’ve crashed a number of drones,” he said. “And in the end, they’re just tools.”After developing series of still images such as “Lux Noctis” and “Aeroglyphs,” which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies, Wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music. He began creating 15-second video loops from his images, showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky, to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced.“These (works) were very much experimental and had no end goal — they were just things that I did for love out of love,” he said. “I couldn’t license them, I couldn’t print them… and so they were just there, stacking likes on my Instagram.”But in January 2021, Wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to NFT art. He minted his first “non-fungible token” on the marketplace Foundation two months later — an “aeroglyph” of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff. It sold for 30 ETH ($45,000), a portion of which he donated to the National Parks Conservation Association and the AAPI Community Fund. Later that year, the web3 arts organization Obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled “Aeroglyph Variations,” which took him into the New Mexico badlands for a 20-hour shoot that resulted in 55 images of the same setting, each with different lighting conditions and patterns. Wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways, from animations, to AR experiences, to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints.“It’s very much a hybrid medium, and so I’d like to expand that horizon even more, and think about the end goal for my work,” he said. “Am I creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate, or am I creating an experience for people to share?”Wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes, but no matter the medium, his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent.“A lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly — that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work,” he said. “But I’m not trying to create an alien-looking image; I’m trying to show that this is our planet. And there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective.”"

        "title": "Anglomania endures at Paris Fashion Week",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Unscathed by the PETA protesters who disrupted her show, Victoria Beckham closed out the fifth day of Paris Fashion Week at the lavish Salomon de Rothschild Hotel on Friday night.Her appearance before a front row filled with her family, designer Simon Porte Jacquemus, Anna Wintour and former French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld — on crutches, as she reportedly injured her foot a few weeks earlier while working out — marked just the latest show by a British designer in Paris. The destination is proving to be something of a home-from-home for the fashion pack from across the Channel.At Carven, Louise Trotter, former creative director for Lacoste, presented her first collection for the French heritage house. Irish-born, Central-Saint Martins-trained Seán McGirr showed his debut for Alexander McQueen, succeeding Sarah Burton. And London-based Ibrahim Kamara, editor-in-chief of “Dazed & Confused” magazine, also showcased his creations as the head of Off-White after a break following founder Virgil Abloh’s death.Stella McCartney has become a staple of the calendar having launched her namesake brand in Paris in 2001. Over at Nina Ricci, Anglo-American designer Harris Reed — who had shown his personal line in London earlier in the season — presented a collection that combined “a fine-art approach with Paris’s classical way of doing things,” he told CNN, adding that he hoped to “push the envelope (…) on inclusive bodies and sexualities… I’ve never been someone who just wanted to make beautiful clothes.”Paris Fashion Week has always centered designers from around the world, offering a creative vision of French chic from an outsider perspective, from German designer Karl Lagerfeld to Japanese creatives including Yohji Yamamoto.But perhaps its most historical cultural dialogue is with Great Britain. In the 19th century, English couturier Charles Worth chose Paris to establish his approach to luxury, and the system of custom-made clothing defining fashion as we know of it today, earning him the nickname of “father of haute couture.”Almost a century later, in the 1990s, a long list of British designers brought a subversive flair to Paris’ fashion scene: Stella McCartney was appointed creative director of Chloé in 1997, succeeding Lagerfeld; John Galliano was head of Dior from 1996 to 2011, the same year Alexander McQueen took over at Givenchy; while Phoebe Philo was made creative director of Chloé in 2001. A few years later, Kim Jones joined Louis Vuitton in 2011 and Dior Men in 2018. (British fashion houses including Vivienne Westwood and Paul Smith also relocated to Paris at different stages of their careers.)Today, in a post-Brexit and post-Covid world, keeping this creative dialogue up has become more challenging. Funding and exporting has become more complex due to revised import regulations, and working with stockists and ateliers throughout Europe is also more difficult, as Serge Carreira from the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode explained.“London is a scene of revelations, where one puts down creative (roots), whereas Paris is a destination once the brand is established, to reach a more global audience,” Carreira told CNN. “This dynamic isn’t new but Paris as a next step in a British designer’s career might feel like a more amplified move.”Yet if the amount of shows put on in London continue shrinking, and if the opposite continues happening at Paris Fashion Week (this last edition featured over 100 shows during a sprawling nine-day event), London might end up feeding the cultural fashion dialogue in different ways.As Melody Thomas, professor in fashion criticism at Parsons Paris and author of “La Mode est Politique” told CNN, “another form of avant-garde is emerging, with off-calendar British brands such as Corteiz pointing, perhaps, to a generation that doesn’t want dream of big runways, but prefers creative drops, collaborations, capsules… Questioning the fashion system at large.”Some would say it’s about time, too."

        "title": "Two skyscrapers joined by daring cantilevered ‘skybridge’ to soar over New York",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A pair of skyscrapers connected by a cantilevered “skybridge” and a rooftop infinity pool is set to join the New York City skyline, as developers unveiled a proposal for a new megaproject just south of the United Nations headquarters on Monday.Designed by architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), the 615-foot-tall towers will contain two hotels, while a soaring lobby across the top will house restaurants, bars, an art gallery a glass-floored (and glass-ceilinged) viewing platform and — should a license be granted — a subterranean casino.Along with two new residential towers, the skyscrapers will flank the newly unveiled Freedom Plaza development, a three-block-long public park with retail spaces and a new “Museum of Freedom and Democracy.”The Midtown Manhattan site, which overlooks the East River, is currently occupied by a large-scale art installation “Field of Light,” by British Artist Bruce Munro, that was commissioned by the charitable arm of Soloviev Group, the property developer behind the plan. But the 6.7-acre patch of prime real estate, roughly the size of Madison Square Park, has sat largely unused since the 2000s.Bjarke Ingels, the Danish founder and creative director of BIG, said his firm’s design looks to extend the greenery that architects Le Corbusier, Wallace Harrison and Oscar Niemeyer created at the neighboring UN building.“We continue to build on these architectural principles by uniting three city blocks to form a public green space reaching from 1st Avenue to the East River overlook, creating a green connection all the way to the water’s edge,” said Ingels in a press statement.The two hotel towers are set to host the city’s first five-star Banyan Tree property, as well as a hotel run by casino operator Mohegan. A 150,000-gallon infinity pool will be built on the roof of the connecting skybridge, with BIG describing it as “one of the largest rooftop pools in North America.”The 50- and 60-story residential towers, meanwhile, nod to the modernist New York City buildings of the 1950s and 1960s thanks to their striped glass and aluminum facades. Measuring 550 and 650 feet tall, the two high-rises will be connected by a podium housing a food market and retail space.The development is one of several projects competing for three casino gaming licenses recently approved for downstate New York by the state’s gaming commission. But plans have faced local opposition, with some residents and officials voicing concern about the development. Hoping to entice authorities to grant the license, the Soloviev Group has said it would designate 513, or nearly 40% of the development’s 1,325 apartments as affordable housing should the license come through.“The revenue generated by the project’s entertainment and hospitality component will allow Freedom Plaza to deliver the affordable housing program and expansive publicly accessible green space, with many more details yet to be announced,” said Ray Pineault, CEO and President of Mohegan in a statement last year.Americans are currently living through the toughest housing market in a generation, and New York has been one of the hardest hit locations, with rental vacancy rates down to a multi-decade low of 1.4%, according to the 2023 NYC Housing and Vacancy Survey.Soloviev Group has also promised that an unspecified percentage of the gaming profits, starting with a minimum $5 million donation, will go to an independently run non-profit community fund.Elsewhere on the site, BIG has designed a new “Museum of Freedom and Democracy” that “celebrates the origin and evolution of one of the most impactful inventions of mankind and our continuous struggle to build, maintain and protect the institutions that uphold it,” said Ingels.The Möbius strip-shaped building, overlooking the river, winds on top of itself creating outdoor walking paths. BIG described the design as an homage to the amphitheaters built by the Ancient Greeks, the creators of modern democracy.Unaffiliated with Long Island University’s Museum of Democracy, the new institution will contain pieces of the Berlin Wall and works from the Soloviev Group’s art collection.“Our plan is to develop this site in a way that delivers benefits for the local neighborhood and the city as a whole, worthy of its skyline and waterfront location, and befitting New York City’s key role as a leader in the global cultural economy,” said Michael Hershman, CEO of the Soloviev Group, in a press release.Groundbreaking and completion dates are yet to be announced as the developers await a decision on the project’s casino license but will likely be finished in five to seven years once building works commences.Should the license not be granted, the project will continue, likely based on a previous design approved in 2008, said the developer."

        "title": "Inside the many, many glamorous homes owned by fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Fashion writer Patrick Mauriès first met Karl Lagerfeld in 1981, after he quoted the fashion designer in a short book he had written about contemporary fashion and culture. Although Lagerfeld had by that time already designed for the luxury houses Chloé and Fendi, he was not the iconic figure he would become later in life, particularly after he joined Chanel as creative director in 1983 — a role he held until his death in 2019. As his star rose, he and Mauriès remained good friends, with the writer enjoying rare glimpses into parts of Lagerfeld’s private life and way of living at his many lavish properties over the years.“Everything was absolute luxury. Even when you went for a small lunch with him, the napkins were embroidered,” said Mauriès, recalling how Lagerfeld was one of the first people he knew to use Diptyque candles at home — but never just one of them, of course. “There would be 20 candles in the staircase leading to the dining room, and so it was a very high luxury feeling.”The full extent of this tirelessly-curated “high luxury” is revealed in the new book “Karl Lagerfeld: A Life in Houses,” with an introduction by Mauriès and accompanying texts about each home by Marie Kalt, a former editor of “Architectural Digest France.” Featuring rarely-seen images of 13 of Lagerfeld’s properties in Europe — spanning Paris, Monte Carlo, Rome, Hamburg and more — the book reveals a lesser-known side to the designer, and provides insight into his sense of style when it came to interior design.Each property was decorated in a different, distinctive way. Lagerfeld’s early Parisian home on the Rue de l’Université — an apartment on the second floor of an 18th-century mansion he shared with his mother in the 1960s and ‘70s — was filled with Art Deco furniture and homeware, from the sofas to the cocktail glasses.In 1977, Lagerfeld moved into the 18th-century Hôtel Pozzo di Borgo in Paris, with his residence — or residences, rather, as he moved at various points between different parts of the building — evoking the grandeur and spirit of the Age of Enlightenment with ornate tapestries and gilded detailing in many of the rooms. “He was playing all the time with the spirit of the place,” said Mauriès, adding that some of the only common threads in Lagerfeld’s interiors were nods to his German heritage.In the Monte Carlo residence he bought in the 1980s, Lagerfeld was drawn to the Memphis Group design school, a collective of designers founded by Italian architect Ettore Sottsass that made use of bold colors, geometry and playfulness. Lagerfeld’s residence in his German hometown of Hamburg, named Vila Jako after his long-term companion Jacques de Bascher, was bought in the early 1990s; Lagerfeld then filled its interiors with objects including vases from the Swedish Grace design movement, which was a bridge between Art Nouveau and Modernism.“It was always changing from one atmosphere to another, from antiquarian interiors to ultra-modern ones,” said Mauriès of Lagerfeld’s design aesthetic, having visited many of his properties over the years, particularly those in Paris. “He’s a singularity in that there is no unity in his type of decoration.”And, as Mauriès explained, while Lagerfeld derived inspiration from the past, a sense of change and forward momentum was an inherent part of his creative practice. “What was essential for him was to live in the present tense or the present times. Once he thought something was a bit outdated or not of the moment, he discarded it and put it in storage,” said Mauriès. “He was always moving, he couldn’t imagine himself stuck in a period or style.”In fact, Mauriès compared Lagerfeld’s approach to decorating each home as almost like designing a theater set, as the designer became completely immersed in the details and minutiae of one space at a time. “And then when it was done, he lost a bit of interest, and went on to create another one.”In a way, this process of reinvention was also an embodiment of Lagerfeld’s fashion design, from one season to the next, and the evolution of his own image and sense of personal style.As Lagerfeld became more of a public figure in the 1990s and 2000s, he increasingly sought homes that could act as retreats, said Mauriès. “It was something he needed to refocus and recreate himself… He needed these lairs in which to work.”In keeping with Lagerfeld’s constant need for change, there is little left of the homes and interiors featured in the book. The designer sold many of the properties while he was still alive, and dispersed or bequeathed items he had collected in various ways, including by auction. A sale at Sotheby’s in 1991 saw Lagerfeld’s collection of 133 Memphis Group items go under the hammer, with a dressing table and matching stool designed by American postmodernist architect Michael Graves reaching 150,000 francs (then about $26,000, or around $59,000 in today’s money). A posthumous auction of objects from Lagerfeld’s estate, including his sketches, clothing and furniture, meanwhile, consisted of 1,200 lots assembled from five of his residences in and around Paris and Monaco.Only one place that Lagerfeld called home has been preserved as it was when he lived there: the 7L bookshop and photo studio that he set up in 1999 in the Rue de Lille in Paris. The property was acquired by Chanel in 2001, and today acts as an homage to the designer. In his lifetime, Lagerfeld was known for his love of books, amassing huge collections and creating libraries in his residences. Today, the bookshop hosts regular public events and offers a library curation service for bibliophiles looking to build their own reading rooms at home.“Everything disappeared — it’s a strange destiny,” said Mauriès. “But that follows his way of living. He was not interested in keeping memories or having these really private and intimate places preserved.”Indeed, Lagerfeld’s own words quoted in the book outline this philosophy: “The most beautiful house is always the next one.”"

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Standing on the South Pole at the start of the year with the wind whipping across the Antarctic, travel blogger Johnny Ward felt a surge of relief.Just a week before, in early January 2024, he’d struggled through snow and ice to summit the Vinson Massif, Antarctica’s highest peak.Years before, in 2017, he’d become the first Irish person to visit every country in the world.Now, after decades of traveling and mountaineering, Ward could claim another world first – the Ultimate Explorer’s Grand Slam, which involves reaching the highest peak on every continent, and visiting both the North and South Poles in addition to visiting every country.“I feel relieved,” Ward told CNN Travel as he slowly made his way back to his home in Thailand after conquering the Vinson Massif (4,892 meters high,) and then setting foot on the South Pole.“But also I’m aware I’m a normal guy, not a world-class athlete, so I guess it was more about resilience and determination more than any ability.”Ward had previously dedicated a decade of his life, between 2007 and 2017, to visiting every country in the world (Ward’s count includes all 193 UN-recognized nations, plus the Vatican, the Palestinian territories, Taiwan and Kosovo).The incredible journey saw him hitchhike a ride on a container ship from Oman to Socotra in Yemen, travel overland from Cairo to Cape Town and travel from South Korea to Australia by bus and boat.“I always wanted to be free. And originally I thought the freest you can be is to visit every country,” he said.“Once I got close to 100 countries, I set the goal of being the first Irish person to visit every country, and at that stage one of the youngest to complete it.”But once he’d managed to visit every country in the world, Ward says he went into a tail-spin.“It had been a huge life goal, over a decade of my life, and then when I finished that I was a bit lost,” he said.“I started eating badly, drinking too much, putting on weight and I ignored my business.”Ward decided that the best way to overcome this was to challenge himself again.He began running ultramarathons and climbing mountains, and soon found that with extreme purpose and direction, he was back to loving life again.“So then I just ran with it,” he explained. “I figure if you’re going to run, run the hardest race in the world. And if you’re going to climb mountains, set your sights on Everest.”Already one of the estimated 250 people or so who’ve visited every country in the world, Ward set his sights on another incredible achievement, The Explorer’s Grand Slam.To complete this challenge, adventurers must visit both the North and South Poles and climb the highest summit on all seven continents – including Mount Everest, Mount Denali and Mount Kilimanjaro – a feat which only around 70 people are thought to have ever completed.When Ward realized that he could perhaps become the first person in the world to both visit every country in the world, and complete the Explorer’s Grand Slam, he didn’t hesitate, spending seven years mountaineering towards his goal.“To be the first?” said Ward, after completing what he’s now calling The Ultimate Explorers Grand Slam.“Crazy. I’m going to start a website for it now to help others, and hopefully, I won’t be the only one for long.”According to Ward, the most difficult aspect of these challenges wasn’t necessarily the logistics, training or fitness, but having the money to take them on.Visiting every country in the world was expensive enough on its own, but climbing Mount Everest cost Ward $77,000, and that was just one of seven peaks he was required to summit.Once this was paid for, he still had to spend large sums on visiting the North and South Pole.Ward has been able to fund his travels through his entrepreneurship. The life he has today is something he never would have imagined as a child.Born in Galway, Ireland, told CNN Travel how domestic issues forced him, his mom and sister to change their names and flee to Northern Ireland - part of the UK - where he would grow up, while his father was in prison.“We spent the next 10 or so years on welfare,” Ward said. “I always remember school friends going to Spain, or Florida, on holiday and being so jealous.“Maybe that’s what lit the travel spark for me, and as soon as I finished university, I took a flight less than 12 hours later. A little hungover, I landed in New York and I never lived in the UK or Ireland again.”To pay for his travels, he taught English in Thailand and South Korea, worked in Australia and even signed up for medical research.Along the way, he launched One Step 4 Ward, a hugely successful travel blog, which has turned him into a millionaire.“I’m not sure what I’ve done is particularly important per se,” Ward said frankly.“But I do think it’s a nice message that coming from a background like mine, people like me can do pretty cool things with their life too.“You don’t need a wealthy family or the right schooling. Anyone can achieve their dreams.”Calling Ward driven would be an understatement — he casually decided to run an Antarctic Marathon while he was waiting for the weather to clear for his journey to the South Pole.He’s now hoping that he doesn’t fall into bad habits again after completing the latest of his bucket list challenges.As the travel community becomes more competitive - the youngest person to visit every country in the world was just 21 when they did so - challenges like this have not only become more difficult, but more extravagant and more expensive.So where will Ward go next, for example? Space? The bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest point of the ocean? Or does he do every country in the world all over again?“Good question. In a social media era, everyone is looking for something, however obscure,” Ward told CNN Travel.“I hope the Ultimate Explorer’s Grand Slam is something other people can join me in though. It would be a pretty epic club.”For now, Ward is putting all his efforts into helping others to achieve their travel goals, launching a series of endurance events to get people out of their comfort zones.The first is a three-day, 150-kilometer ultra marathon in the Sahara Desert, which is taking place in December 2024.He also has a more typical challenge on his list.“I recently turned 40. I want to have kids, so that’s a big plan for sure,” said Ward of his future plans.“From an adventure perspective, I really, really, really want to show ‘normal’ people just how much benefits they can get from wild experiences.“All good things come after suffering, and I want to share that with people. So that’s the next plan.”"

        "title": "You’re trapped in a blizzard. Do you know what to do next to survive?",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Warm thoughts of young romance – not the cold, harsh possibilities of a Midwestern road trip in winter – were on Dawn O’Hair’s mind as she left Chicago for Indianapolis to see her boyfriend.Her weekend visit, back in the winter of 1997-98, did not go well. After a spat with her beau, O’Hair got back into her car very early on a Monday morning to return to Chicago and her job.She should have stayed put. The 23-year-old was driving up Interstate 65 straight into a blizzard.“I ended up in whiteout conditions. I had trouble maintaining control in my 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier,” she said. “The wind was crazy. The snow was blowing sideways. It was super hard to see. It was horrible.”“I got nervous and decided to pull over [but] my car got stuck,” she said. “I didn’t know what to do. I got out and tried to figure out a way to get traction, but without luck.”And there she was – in a real mess. She hadn’t checked the forecasts. She had nothing particularly warm to wear. No blankets. No winter kit. Just her Chevy and time to ponder how things went so wrong so fast.O’Hair’s story is a far too common one of people caught off guard by a blizzard or some other onslaught of wintry weather.Blizzards can happen over a surprisingly wide range of the calendar – just ask these runners caught in a blizzard in October in Utah in 2021.Of course, we expect rough winter weather in January. And on the first days of January 2024, a second monster winter storm with possibly dangerous blizzards in portions of it threatened much of the central and eastern United States.Unless you live in a year-round warm climate and plan to stay there, it’s important to know how winter storms behave, how to avoid and prepare for them, and heaven forbid, what to do in the worst-case scenario.First, not every ol’ winter storm is technically a blizzard.The National Weather Service says a blizzard must have large amounts of falling snow or blowing snow, winds greater than 35 mph (56 kph) and visibility of less than a quarter mile (0.4 km) for at least three hours. A ground blizzard has no falling snow; instead, it blows around snow that had fallen before the blizzard kicked up.Any weather system with below freezing temperatures along with snow and ice can be a safety hazard. Blizzards, however, are one of the most dangerous types of winter storms.They can lead not only “to perilous driving conditions under low visibility and snow-covered roads, but can also lead to disorientation for anyone walking or driving, resulting in the person not knowing where they are or where they are going,” said Michael Muccilli, meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s NWS, in an email interview with CNN Travel.“Oftentimes the strong winds and cold temperatures associated with blizzards can produce dangerous wind chills, which can lead to hypothermia and frostbite, especially if stuck outside for extended periods,” he said.Awareness and avoidance are your best weapons against blizzards and other bad winter weather.If you’re taking a road trip, “begin checking weather conditions about a week in advance of your trip and make sure to check again each day as the weather forecasts become more fine-tuned,” Muccilli said.“Have alternate plans for your travel, and if weather conditions are looking increasingly unfavorable, use those alternate plans or delay travel.”Muccilli said you should check conditions along your entire route, not just the starting and ending points, especially if you’re crossing through high mountain passes.If you’re going hiking or camping, checking forecasts is a must, said Beth Pratt, the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation.Don’t skip a forecast check just because it’s fall, spring or even summer in some locations. They can lull you into a false sense of security because your guard might not be up as much as the dead of winter, Pratt said.She resides on the border of Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevadas, where you might start out on a hike on a late fall day while it’s still warm but suddenly encounter a dangerous wintry blast.NOAA has nine winter forecast tools you can check online to see what might be ahead.A little geographical and climate knowledge helps, too.“Blizzards are most common in the upper Midwest and Great Plains in the United States, but can occur in most areas of the country except the Gulf Coast and coastal California,” Muccilli said. Elsewhere in the world, you’ll encounter them most often in Russia, central and northeastern Asia (including China), northern Europe, Canada and Antarctica.Just as it’s important to know blizzards aren’t a winter-only event, you must also realize they might happen in places you usually associate with hot weather.Iran was struck by a 1972 blizzard that killed thousands. At least four people died in Spain early in 2021 in a rare blizzard. And parts of inland Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas were slammed by blizzard conditions in the 1993 storm of the century.Having the right clothing is crucial if you’re going to a place where blizzards and other cold-weather storms might happen.The American Red Cross says to “wear layered clothing, mittens or gloves, and a hat. Outer garments should be tightly woven and water repellent. Mittens or gloves and a hat will prevent the loss of body heat.”Remember O’Hair’s predicament. It’s important to bring along winter clothing even if it’s not that cold or threatening as you depart or you just plan on staying in your car.Layering is important, says the Massachusetts government website: “Dress in several layers of loose-fitting, lightweight clothing instead of a single heavy layer.”Minnesota’s state government points out another reason to layer: You might need to take a layer or two off to avoid overheating, perspiring too much and then subsequently getting chilled. The website advises mittens over gloves.If you’re outside, the Red Cross also says to cover your mouth to protect your lungs from severely cold air. Don’t gulp in deep breaths of frigid air and talk as little as possible.Make sure you have fully stocked safety kit before you head out. Muccilli said the kit should include:– A survival blanket– Road salt and a shovel– A scraper– Jumper cables– Drinking water– A repair kit– A flashlight and road flares– A cell phone chargerYou should also fill your wiper fluid and check your tire pressure, tire tread and oil before leaving. Make sure your phone is fully charged.What if you run into bad winter weather?“If the weather becomes too severe to continue driving, pull over, and if possible move your car to the closest gas station or hotel and ride out the storm,” Muccilli said. Don’t drive around barriers onto closed-off roads.What if your car is stuck in the snow?If conditions are safe enough, you can “attempt to shovel out your tires and throw down sand, rock salt, dirt, cardboard or kitty litter to give your vehicle more traction. If this does not work, call for roadside assistance or emergency services.”Otherwise, Muccilli said stay inside your vehicle except long enough to set road flares or put out a colorful cloth to make yourself visible. Contact emergency services with as much information about your situation as you can.The NWS advises not to leave your vehicle to walk for help during a blizzard. You could get disoriented. You should run the motor about 10 minutes each hour for heat, it says, but open the window a crack for fresh air. Clear snow away from the exhaust pipe if possible.Whether you are camping, hiking, backcountry skiing or doing other similar types of outside activities, carry the correct safety gear. Muccilli said this might include but is not limited to:– Proper footwear – Enough water and food– A headlamp and a lighter– A whistle– A first aid kit– A map or other navigation tools– A transceiver to transmit your location in case you are trapped in an avalanche– A probe to pinpoint your exact location– A shovel to dig out– An airbag pack to increase your chances of staying near the surface of an avalanche.“Never hike or ski alone and make sure someone knows where you are going,” he said.People enjoying a day (or night) at a ski resort should check the local weather forecast just before heading out to the slopes, said Rick Shandler, national program director of the Safety Team at National Ski Patrol.He cautions skiers to not let their investment in a pricey lift ticket cloud their judgment.“People want to get the most value out of their lift tickets and may stay out past what common sense dictates” when blizzards, dense fog or other bad weather is approaching, he said.He suggested taking the following with you on the slopes:– A fully charged cell phone in an inner pocket. The cold can quickly sap your battery if it’s in an outer pocket. Get the number of the ski patrol at the resort before you head out and add it to your phone.– A whistle. The sound carries farther than yelling if you’re down and a ski patrol needs to find you.– A space blanket. Made of Mylar, they are inexpensive, easy to tote and can keep you warmer and easier to spot if you become stranded.Pratt said the closest she ever came to dying in a blizzard was in her college years back in 1990. It was in June of all months, while she was hiking with two friends on Mount Washington in New Hampshire.The mountain is notorious for its dangerous, fickle weather, even in summer.“The storm came up very fast. We were in college, and young and broke and didn’t have great gear either.”With the wind whipping and whiteout conditions of a blizzard, “the only thing that saved us is we found the tracks to the Mount Washington Cog Railway. So we had breadcrumbs to follow. If we had not been near those train tracks, we would have had to hunker down. The wind was so fierce it had shredded our rain gear.”What if you end up in a worst-case scenario like Pratt? She said there are “two things to focus on: Stay warm and stay still.”“It’s ill-advised to walk yourself out of a blizzard. Navigation is tough, and you burn more energy when you are cold, so conserve it. Find shelter. If there is none to find, build a snow cave if there’s enough snow. Wait it out.”The NWS has some additional advice for dire situations when it’s just you vs. the raw elements:– Try to find shelter: Also, attempt to stay dry and cover all of your body.– Can’t find shelter? See if you can make a lean-to, windbreak or snow cave for protection from the wind. Try to set a fire. If there are rocks nearby, put those around the fire to retain heat. Global Rescue says even low-hanging tree branches could provide some protection.– Out of water? You should melt snow for drinking water. The NWS and Global Rescue warn that eating unmelted snow will lower your body temperature.– Strategic exercise: From time to time, move your arms, legs, fingers and toes to keep your blood pumping and stay warm. But don’t overdo it. “The strain from the cold and the hard labor may cause a heart attack. Sweating could lead to a chill and hypothermia,” the NWS website says.Fortunately for Dawn O’Hair, what she lacked in winter preparation she made up for in a good decision, good luck and good connections with people in northern Indiana.She wisely stayed with her car instead of walking off into the blizzard for help.Less than an hour later, a young woman pulled up and offered her a ride to a gas station. That woman had a boyfriend who was a police officer, and he took her to an Indiana state police post. From the post, she was able to reach a cousin to give her refuge and was transported to that cousin’s house via snowmobile.It ended up taking her several days and more on-the-road misadventures to make the roughly 170-mile drive back home.So what did Dawn O’Hair Czanik – yes, she ended up marrying the boyfriend with whom she had the spat – learn from the experience?“I would have paid more attention to the weather forecast and planned ahead better! I probably would have left the day before, but young love is kinda stupid, ya know?”"

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Iceland has evacuated its world-famous Blue Lagoon due to nearby seismic activity that suggests an “imminent” volcanic eruption, the country’s public broadcaster RÚV reported Saturday.Magma has begun flowing after “intense seismic activity” in the area around the lagoon, a popular geothermal spa known for its milky-blue, comforting warm waters, according to RÚV.The depth of the magma, around four kilometers (2.5 miles), means an eruption could take place within hours, volcanologist Thorvaldur Thordarson told RÚV.The nearby town of Grindavík is also being evacuated, according to RÚV. Police said the evacuation was “going well” and there had been only a few people in the town in recent days, the public broadcaster added.In a statement on its website Saturday, Blue Lagoon said it had initiated an evacuation of its premises due to “increased seismic activity in a known area, a few kilometers away.”Operations would be closed at least until the end of Sunday, when the situation would be reassessed, it said.“We will continue to closely follow the guidelines and recommendations of the authorities, working collaboratively with them to monitor the progression of events,” the statement added.Located just under an hour’s drive from Iceland’s capital and largest city Reykjavik, the Blue Lagoon is one of the country’s most popular tourist attractions.The site is part of southwest Iceland’s Reykjanes Peninsula – a thick finger of land pointing west into the North Atlantic Ocean from Reykjavik. As well as the Blue Lagoon, the peninsula is home to Iceland’s main airport, Keflavik International.Iceland is one of the most active volcanic areas on the planet. Rather than having a central volcano, the Reykjanes Peninsula is dominated by a rift valley, with lava fields and cones.In November, the Blue Lagoon was closed for a week after 1,400 earthquakes were measured in 24 hours."

        "title": "She missed her flight to extend her Italy vacation romance. Here’s what happened next",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Bianca Gignac was swimming under the stars, against a backdrop of colorful, cliffside houses, with a complete stranger, her clothes left in a pile on a rock.Bianca was in the harbor of Riomaggiore, the southernmost of the five picturesque fishing villages that make up the Italian Cinque Terre region. Built into the rocks overlooking the Ligurian Sea, it’s spectacularly scenic.“The Cinque Terre is unlike anything you’ve experienced,” Bianca tells CNN Travel today. “It’s like a dream. Something you’ll never comprehend until you’re there. It’s truly a must-see place.”Bianca had arrived in Riomaggiore, fallen for its beauty and now – somehow – she’d found herself swimming - sans clothes - with a guy she’d just met. The two strangers laughed, splashed each other, soaked up the moment.“We were swimming in the phosphorescence, under the stars,” Bianca recalls. “It was a perfect July 26 evening.”It was July 26, 2003, to be precise. Bianca was a Canadian college student in her mid-20s, spending the summer in Italy. She was studying fine arts, and a scholarship from the Italian Cultural Institute of Vancouver led her to Florence – the fulfillment of a lifelong dream of visiting Europe.When Bianca arrived in Florence, she was grieving a failed relationship. Slowly and surely, Italy had won her over, helped her rebuild her sense of self.“I went on to have the most incredible summer, I was really finding my footing,” says Bianca.“Then, three days before I was leaving to go home, my friend said, ‘Let’s go to the Cinque Terre. It’s the most romantic place I’ve ever been to. And so we went there for the weekend. And within hours, I met him.’”“Him” was Bianca’s nighttime swimming companion – Alessandro Morelli, a twentysomething from La Spezia, the nearest city to the Cinque Terre, a 10-minute train journey from Riomaggiore.“I had a steady job with the local shipyard,” Alessandro tells CNN Travel. It was a job everyone assumed he’d do all his life – in general, his life was “steady” and “routine.”Alessandro was in Riomaggiore on July 26 for a friend’s birthday party. The plan was to gather on the beach to celebrate and enjoy the long summer night. Alessandro was walking through the village with a friend when they decided to detour via one of the outdoor bars built into the cliffs.It was at this bar that Alessandro and Bianca’s eyes first met.The connection was “plain and simple,” says Alessandro. He couldn’t stop looking at Bianca.“The red hair – she was the prettiest girl I’d ever seen,” Alessandro recalls.He told his friend he was going to go and speak to her. Then, Alessandro got up, walked over to Bianca’s table and asked if he could buy Bianca and her friend a drink.The moment Alessandro approached her table, Bianca felt an “instant connection.”“What struck me was he was very kind. He wasn’t cocky,” she says. “He was a kind person and I could feel that.”Bianca asked Alessandro if he wanted to sit with them. Then, his friend pulled up a chair too.“We just started talking,” says Bianca – they spoke in English, as Bianca’s Italian wasn’t great back then.“So it was the four of us. And we literally talked into the night,” she recalls. “We were in this little bar, it still exists today, 20 years later - it overlooks the little bobbing boats in the harbor. It’s super picturesque.”The group stayed until closing. Then they walked down to the harbor and greeted the birthday party revelers.That’s when Alessandro suggested the nighttime dip: “Let’s go swimming,” he said to Bianca.“I’m not going swimming in those waters,” said Bianca, skeptically. It was pitch black out, the sea dark and the water and rocks illuminated only by starlight.But Alessandro won Bianca over – in his presence, she felt safe, free, happy.“So we went out skinny dipping,” Bianca recalls.It was a joyful end to the evening. Later, in the early hours of the morning, Bianca and her friend returned to their rented room, tired, but happy.Then, mere hours later, the sun was streaming through the window, and there was a knock on the door.“I was like, ‘What is going on? Who is that?’” recalls Bianca.She tentatively opened the door, and there was Alessandro and his friend from the night before, grinning.“These guys were there, with their speedos on, their bags, their sunscreen and they were like, ‘Girls, let’s go on a boat trip.’”It was July 27 – Bianca’s birthday. She’d mentioned the significance of the date the night before, and Alessandro figured a boat trip was the perfect way to celebrate.Alessandro’s friend was from Riomaggiore and he had a boat – “one of the fishing boats bobbing in the marina.” So the group spent the day floating around the Cinque Terre villages, admiring the green hills, the houses dotted among the cliffs, sunbathing and exploring. It was a magical birthday.Bianca and Alessandro were inseparable for the rest of the weekend.“We were simply living the typical Italian summer. Going to the beach, going out for pizza — going on walks,” says Bianca. “The guys just kept knocking on our door every day and taking us out. And we just kept saying yes.”The four of them - Bianca and her friend and Alessandro and his friend - all got on well.“It seemed incredibly normal and comfortable and we just all were having a great time and it was very relaxed — almost like we had been friends for a long time,” says Bianca.Bianca and her friend were only in Riomaggiore for a long weekend. The next week, she had a midnight train booked to Rome, which would take her to the airport and back to Canada, bringing her Italian summer to an end.After three days with Alessandro, Bianca didn’t want to leave, but she figured she had no choice.“I packed up my bag. I was leaving Italy for good,” she says.Before heading to the train station, Bianca went out for a last dinner with Alessandro, “three steps away from where we met, while waiting for the train to arrive at the station.”Bianca’s bag was at her feet. She’d checked out of her accommodation. All the signs pointed to her leaving. But neither Bianca nor Alessandro could accept that this was goodbye.“Bianca, don’t go,” Alessandro said, as the time came for her to make her way to the station.“I have to,” Bianca said. “I have a job, I have college.”But Bianca made no signs of moving. Something inside her knew – she wasn’t going.So Bianca missed her train. She missed the flight. It was out of character, but it was exciting. It felt like the right decision.With Alessandro in tow, Bianca returned to her vacation rental and asked the owner if she could extend the trip – back then Cinque Terre wasn’t as busy as it is today, so that was a potentially doable request. The owner, who knew Alessandro, just looked at the pair of them and “laughed and laughed.”“It’s a small village,” says Bianca. “He slapped Alessandro on the back and gave him the keys.”Over the next 10 days, Bianca and Alessandro grew even closer.“We didn’t try hard or force anything. It was just completely natural and we were just spending every minute together for a week,” says Bianca. “He even brought me to meet his mother, Paola, almost right away. I just sat in their kitchen and she was so sweet. She fed me, of course.”Alessandro also took Bianca on the back of his scooter for hilltop rides around the Cinque Terre. They spent long days together, exploring, chatting.“​​And then I really did go,” says Bianca. “When we said goodbye at the train station, I was crying. I was like, ‘I’m never going to see you again.’ And I really believed that there was no concept that I would ever see him again.”Back in Canada, Bianca focused on her degree. She was going into her final year of college and her goal was graduating. She tried to put Alessandro out of her mind. But before she’d left Italy, they’d exchanged contact details.And while Bianca assumed they’d never see each other again, Alessandro was sure it was meant to be. He made an effort to stay in touch.“I started calling her, and we’d talk over the phone,” he says.These conversations became more and more regular.And then, when Christmas rolled around, Alessandro suggested Bianca should come back to Italy, stay with him for the holidays.“I have school,” Bianca said. “And I don’t have any money to go to Italy”“I’ve got a solid job,” said Alessandro. “I’ll buy your plane ticket.”The idea of seeing Alessandro again, of being back in Italy, was almost overwhelming to Bianca. During their months apart, she’d daydreamed about night swimming in Riomaggiore, about their long days exploring together, the evenings at cliffside restaurants. She decided to go for it.“Okay, I’m coming,” Bianca told Alessandro on the phone.When Bianca told her college friends her plans, they were in disbelief. Some didn’t believe it could last.But one friend was adamant. “He bought you a plane ticket? You’re going to marry him and have babies.”“I don’t think so,” said Bianca. “But let’s see.”Bianca spent the holidays with Alessandro and his extended family in La Spezia. The trip lasted just over a week, but by the time Bianca was heading back to Canada in early 2004, she and Alessandro had a goal: when Bianca graduated from college, she’d come back to Italy.“So that was our plan. So then it was just about me going home, wrapping up, graduating,” says Bianca.That summer, Alessandro came to Canada to celebrate Bianca’s graduation and meet her family. Then, right after graduating, Bianca moved to Italy. It was exciting, but a little surreal. And for Bianca – who still didn’t speak much Italian – it was a big step.One of Alessandro’s friends told him he thought Bianca would last “two weeks.” But he was quickly proven wrong. Bianca stayed for one month, then two and then…“Within three months of us living together, we were married,” says Bianca.It was a somewhat spontaneous decision. “We were young and dumb,” says Bianca today, laughing.But it also felt like the absolute right decision. Bianca and Alessandro were in love, and wanted to spend their lives together.Bianca phoned her parents in Canada to break the news.“I called my family and I said, ‘I’m getting married. In three weeks. I am so sorry to do this to you. I know that’s hard to hear that I’m getting married in three weeks. But I’m doing it,’” Bianca recalls.Her loved ones were a little surprised, but supportive.“Even if we had this long distance thing for a while, we had been together enough for people to understand that it was super serious,” she says.“We just ran off to city hall. We got married on a Friday, got the day off work, and showed up in clothes we already owned. I went to the florist across the street and got a baby’s breath, and put it behind my hair.”Alessandro’s friend – the one who’d been there the night the couple met in Riomaggiore – translated the wedding service from Italian to English for Bianca. Alessandro’s family also attended and toasted their future.Bianca and Alessandro lived and worked in Italy for the next two years, including a period living with Alessandro’s mother in her home. Bianca had been hesitant about moving in there, but everyone being under one roof allowed her to really bond with Alessandro’s loved ones.“All of his family lived there. His aunt lived upstairs. His uncle used to live downstairs, it was the family home that the grandfather built. So it was just this incredible experience for somebody like me, coming into this whole culture and becoming part of his life,” says Bianca.Bianca and Alessandro also spent a period living in an apartment, just the two of them. During this time, they lived in the moment “just enjoying the now,” as Alessandro puts it.But they also learned a lesson that became essential to their relationship, as they navigated cultural differences and the first months of married life.“When you’re in a relationship, you need to exercise the deepest patience,” says Alessandro. “Even more so when someone is from a different culture.”“Patience and understanding, you have to have that as a couple anyway,” agrees Bianca. “When you are in an international relationship, it takes a lot more compassion and understanding.”Bianca worked in a gelateria, which she says was “very stressful,” but which she credits as the reason why she finally perfected Italian. In time, she could speak the language fluently, and she was acclimatized to life in La Spezia.But after two years, Bianca and Alessandro were ready for a change. They relocated to Canada, to Vancouver Island, where Bianca’s family lived.This marked a shift into a new chapter of their lives.“We bought a house and I was pregnant within a month,” says Bianca. “We ended up totally building a life in Canada, and having our daughter.”While she was busy reacquainting herself with Canada, looking after a newborn, and then a toddler, an idea started percolating in Bianca’s head.In time, this idea became a business: Italian Fix – a Canada-based tour company running specialized Italian small group tours, aiming to give visitors a taste of Italy as the locals live it.The company was inspired by Bianca’s “knowledge from living in Italy and the lifestyle that I had grown to love and be a part of,” as she explains it.Her company’s first trip was – of course – to the Cinque Terre.“I got my first group of nine guests and I completely introduced them to all the people I had met there, all of my connections that I’ve built over the two years, and I just was like ‘Welcome to my world, and here’s a week of living in the Cinque Terre,’” recalls Bianca.“That was the start and the seed of the company now I’ve been running for 12 years.”As for Alessandro, he was “happy and enthusiastic” to put down roots in Canada. He got a good job working in engineering, and focused on co-parenting with Bianca.While Alessandro found there were “many differences” between Italy and Canada, he felt they were “mostly positive.”Plus, he often joined Bianca on her Italian trips. The couple would take their daughter along too, and spend time with their Italian family.Bianca and Alessandro’s shared commitment to prioritizing work, family and travel became the cornerstone of their family life.“Even if we grew up in different countries, we have the same worldview. And the same worldview is, work hard, say yes to opportunities, don’t give up on yourself and your own dreams and see what incredible life you can build together,” says Bianca.“That’s one of the values that we do say to our daughter – we’re like, ‘Don’t miss out on opportunities. If somebody gives you an opportunity, say yes.’ Because that’s very much how we’ve lived our life.”The family have lived in Canada ever since, aside from a year spent living in Costa Rica.“Everything really does open up after you move to one country – moving to others doesn’t seem so daunting,” says Bianca. “We had a fabulous year living on a white sand beach, and it was one of the best experiences.”Bianca and Alessandro’s daughter is now in her teens. Bianca and Alessandro still take her to Italy whenever they can.“She’s been to most corners of Italy, she speaks Italian,” says Bianca. “We have so much affection for Italy, we have so many friends there. Half of our friends and half of our amazing family memories are in Italy – they’re half in Canada, and they’re half in Italy, because we really have lived this international family life, living in two places.”The Cinque Terre, of course, will always have a special place in Bianca and Alessandro’s hearts.“It’s not a magical place where we go and relive our initial connection,” says Alessandro. “It’s just home. It’s home number two.”Looking back on their 20 years together, Alessandro and Bianca say they feel “grateful and proud.”Over the two decades, “the relationship has evolved in a million ways,” says Alessandro.“But the very core of who we were – which is two young people who wanted a great life for themselves, and were brave enough to say, ‘yes’ – we’re actually the same kind of people,” he says.The couple are always looking to the future and potential exciting opportunities – work-related, travel-related, family-related. They pride themselves on trusting their instincts, diving head first into what feels right, just as they did with their romance back in July 2003.“All the things we built, that we have, are thanks to us jumping on that train that was running by,” says Alessandro. “Over 20 years of us being together, that to me was actually a lesson – don’t ever miss a train, because it might not go by again.”“Or do miss the train,” says Bianca, laughing. “Because then you get to stay, like I did.”"

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Eva Longoria can’t get enough of this salty dish.While visiting the sun-soaked city of Mérida on Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, she met Regina Escalante, who runs the wildly popular restaurant Merci, and sampled the chef’s grilled fish with sour orange, prepared beachside for flavorful tacos.In her cooking, Escalante uses one of the region’s most beloved ingredients — salt.It comes from the fishing village of Celestún, where salt flats produce many forms of the mineral, including the purest, flor de sal. The briny seawater combines with warm rain, slowly evaporating in the tropical heat, and it leaves behind this prized pinkish crystal.To showcase the flaky salt, Escalante made Longoria grilled sea bass served with avocado and grilled mango in an episode of the CNN Original Series “Eva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.” The fish is stuffed with garlic, rosemary, thyme, sour orange and, of course, a generous dose of salt.To ramp up the flavor, the chef turned to her secret weapon: an herb brush.Escalante made the brush by bundling fresh parsley, rosemary and thyme together and used it to lather the fish with a garlic puree made with juice from sour oranges.“This is my idea of food heaven. Truly, I’d have this as my last meal on Earth,” Longoria said in the docuseries while enjoying the beachside dish.“The contrast of the crunchy salt and the soft, sweet fish is just sublime.”Escalante has a simple formula. “With delicious ingredients, we can make delicious recipes,” she said.Chef Regina Escalante prepares this flavorful fish for tacos that are layered with fresh avocado, grilled mango and onion pickled in sour orange juice. She uses Yucatecan flor de sal, but you can use a more readily available substitute, such as coarse Himalayan pink sea salt or gray sea salt.Makes 4 servingsIngredients1 white onion1 garlic bulb (2 ounces or 60 grams) left whole for roasting plus cloves from ½ garlic bulb (1 ounce or 30 grams), separated, peeled and crushed for stuffing the fishScant 1½ cups | 335 milliliters olive oil, divided3⅓ to 4½ pounds | 1.5-2 kilograms whole fish, such as sea bass, branzino or red snapper1.8 ounces | 50 grams fresh thyme sprigs, divided1.8 ounces | 50 grams fresh rosemary sprigs, divided1.8 ounces | 50 grams fresh flat-leaf parsley sprigs, divided7 sour oranges (also known as bitter or Seville oranges)2½ teaspoons | 10 grams coarse Himalayan pink sea salt or gray sea salt, plus more to taste½ teaspoon (or 2⅓ grams) freshly ground black pepper plus more to taste1 medium red onion, sliced (7 ounces or 200 grams)2 mangoes4 key limes3.5 ounces | 100 grams fresh cilantro leaves, divided2 avocados12 corn tortillasInstructions1. Light the grill. When the grill is hot, halve the white onion. Stick 1 onion half on the end of a grilling fork (reserve the other half for another use) and scrub the grates, cut side down, to clean them. Trim about ½ inch (or 1¼ centimeters) off the top of 1 whole garlic bulb, exposing the individual cloves. Drizzle 1 tablespoon (or 15 milliliters) olive oil over and then wrap the bulb in aluminum foil. Roast the garlic bulb over indirect heat until soft, about 40 minutes.2. When the garlic is nearly halfway through roasting, clean and scale the fish, and let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes.3. Remove the roasted garlic bulb from the grill and let cool. While it cools, make a bouquet with half of the thyme, rosemary and parsley and secure it with kitchen twine.4. Stuff the fish with 2 slices from 1 sour orange (reserve the remaining sour orange for another use), crushed cloves from the remaining half of a raw garlic bulb, and the remaining thyme, rosemary and parsley. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon (or 4 grams) salt inside the cavity.5. Squeeze the cloves out of the roasted garlic bulb into a bowl with a scant 1 cup (or 200 milliliters) oil, 1 teaspoon (or 4 grams) salt and ½ teaspoon (or 2⅓ grams) pepper and mash with a wooden spoon to combine. Squeeze the juice from 3 sour oranges (about 1 cup or 237 milliliters) and mix together.6. Season fish with salt, place on grill over moderately high heat and drizzle with 4 tablespoons (or 60 milliliters) olive oil. Grill, using the herb bouquet to brush the fish constantly with the garlic puree, until golden and crispy, about 10 minutes on each side (depending on the type and size of fish).7. Transfer the grilled fish to a serving platter. Let stand for 10 minutes.For the toppings1. Meanwhile, combine the red onion and juice from 3 sour oranges in a bowl. Let stand for about 10 minutes.2. Slice each mango lengthwise for a total of 4 skin-on, flat pieces. Taking care not to pierce the skin so it remains attached, score the flesh in a ½-inch (or 1¼-centimeter) crosshatch pattern. Grill the mango slices over medium heat until charred, 3 to 4 minutes. Using tongs, remove from grill and let cool. For each slice, invert the skin and slice it off; transfer the mango cubes to a bowl.3. Combine mangoes with zest and juice from 1 lime, half of the cilantro, remaining ¼ cup (60 milliliters) olive oil and ½ teaspoon (or 2 grams) salt.4. In a separate bowl, mash the avocados and season with juice of 1 lime, salt and pepper to taste.5. Sprinkle the tortillas with water and place them on the grill over indirect heat until the bottom of each is browned in spots, about 45 seconds. Flip with tongs and heat the other side, about 45 seconds.6. Build the tacos by filling each tortilla first with avocado, then layer the fish, onion and mango. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro and finish with salt. Serve with wedges cut from the remaining 2 limes.Craving more? Sign up for CNN Travel’s Unlocking Mexico newsletter series.

        "title": "50 of the world’s best breads",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "What is bread? You likely don’t have to think for long, and whether you’re hungry for a slice of sourdough or craving some tortillas, what you imagine says a lot about where you’re from.But if bread is easy to picture, it’s hard to define.Bread historian William Rubel argues that creating a strict definition of bread is unnecessary, even counterproductive. “Bread is basically what your culture says it is,” says Rubel, the author of “Bread: A Global History.” “It doesn’t need to be made with any particular kind of flour.”Instead, he likes to focus on what bread does: It turns staple grains such as wheat, rye or corn into durable foods that can be carried into the fields, used to feed an army or stored for winter.Even before the first agricultural societies formed around 10,000 BCE, hunter-gatherers in Jordan’s Black Desert made bread with tubers and domesticated grain.Today, the descendants of those early breads showcase the remarkable breadth of our world’s food traditions.In the rugged mountains of Germany’s Westphalia region, bakers steam loaves of dense rye for up to 24 hours, while a round of Armenian lavash made from wheat turns blistered and brown after 30 seconds inside a tandoor oven.Ethiopian cooks ferment injera’s ground-teff batter into a tart, bubbling brew, while the corn dough for Venezuelan arepas is patted straight onto a sizzling griddle.This list reflects that diversity. Along with memorable flavor, these breads are chosen for their unique ingredients, iconic status and the sheer, homey pleasure of eating them.From the rich layers of Malaysian roti canai to Turkey’s seed-crusted simit, they’re a journey through the essence of global comfort food – and a reminder that creativity, like bread, is a human inheritance.In alphabetical order by location, here are 50 of the world’s most wonderful breads.Golden blisters of crisp dough speckle a perfectly made bolani, but the real treasure of Afghanistan’s favorite flatbread is hidden inside.After rolling out the yeast-leavened dough into a thin sheet, Afghan bakers layer bolani with a generous filling of potatoes, spinach or lentils. Fresh herbs and scallions add bright flavor to the chewy, comforting dish, which gets a crispy crust when it’s fried in shimmering-hot oil.When your Armenian mother-in-law comes towards you wielding a hula hoop-sized flatbread, don’t duck: Lavash is draped over the country’s newlyweds to ensure a life of abundance and prosperity.Maybe that’s because making lavash takes friends.To shape the traditional breads, groups of women gather to roll and stretch dough across a cushion padded with hay or wool. It takes a practiced hand to slap the enormous sheets onto the inside of conical clay ovens, where they bake quickly in the intense heat.The bread is so central to Armenia’s culture it’s been designated UNESCO Intangible Heritage.A traveler’s staple suited to life on the road, damper recalls Australia’s frontier days.It’s a simple blend of water, flour and salt that can be cooked directly in the ashes, pressed into a cast iron pan or even toasted at the end of a stick. These days, recipes often include some chemical leavening, butter and milk, turning the hearty backwoods fare into a more refined treat similar to Irish soda bread.A dunk in hot oil turns soft wheat dough into a blistered, golden flatbread that’s a perfect pairing with the country’s aromatic curries.It’s a popular choice for breakfast in Bangladesh, often served with white potato curry, but you can find the puffy breads everywhere from Dhaka sidewalk stalls to home kitchens.It’s a triumph of kitchen ingenuity that South America’s native cassava is eaten at all: The starchy root has enough naturally occurring cyanide to kill a human being.But by carefully treating cassava with a cycle of soaking, pressing and drying, many of the continent’s indigenous groups found a way to turn the root into an unlikely culinary star. Now, it’s the base for one of Brazil’s most snackable treats, a cheesy bread roll whose crisp crust gives way to a tender, lightly sour interior.The fire is always lit at Montreal’s Fairmount Bagel, which became the city’s first bagel bakery when it opened in 1919 under the name Montreal Bagel Bakery.Inside, bakers use long, slender wooden paddles to slide rows of bagels into the wood-fired oven, where they toast to a deep golden color.New Yorkers might think they have a monopoly on bagels, but the Montreal version is an entirely different delicacy.Here, bagel dough is mixed with egg and honey, and the hand-shaped rings are boiled in honey water before baking. The result is dense, chewy and lightly sweet, and you can buy them hot from the oven 24 hours a day.An influx of European immigrants brought their wheat-bread traditions to Chile in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the country’s favorite snack has descended from that cultural collision.Split into four lobes, the marraqueta has a pale, fluffy interior, but the ubiquitous roll is all about the crust. Bakers slide a pan of water into the oven to achieve an addictively crispy exterior that is a favorite part of the marraqueta for many Chileans.It’s a nourishing part of daily life, to the extent that when a Chilean wants to describe a child born to a life of plenty, they might say “nació con la marraqueta bajo el brazo,” or “they were born with a marraqueta under their arm.”Crack into the sesame-seed crust of a shaobing to reveal tender layers that are rich with wheat flavor.Expert shaobing bakers whirl and slap the dough so thin that the finished product has 18 or more layers. The north Chinese flatbread can then be spiked with sweet or savory fillings, from black sesame paste to smoked meat or Sichuan pepper.Melted lard lends a hint of savory flavor to loaves of pan Cubano, whose fluffy crumb offers a tender contrast to the crisp, cracker-like crust.Duck into a Cuban bakery, and you’ll likely spot the long, golden loaf with a pale seam down the center: Some bakers press a stripped palmetto leaf into the dough before baking to create a distinctive crack along the length of the bread.It’s popular from Havana to Miami, but it’s only stateside that you’ll find the loaves in “Cuban sandwiches,” which are thought to have been invented during the 19th century by Cubans living in Florida.Bedouin tribes travel light in Egypt’s vast deserts, carrying sacks of wheat flour to make each day’s bread in the campfire.While some Bedouin breads are baked on hot metal sheets, libba is slapped directly into the embers. That powerful heat sears a crisp, browned crust onto the soft dough, leaving the inside steaming and moist.Walk the streets of San Salvador, and you’ll never be far from the toasted-corn scent of cooking pupusas.The griddled corn bread is both a beloved snack and a national icon.To make pupusas, a cook wraps a filling of cheese, pork or spiced beans into tender corn dough, then pats the mixture onto a blazing-hot griddle. A bright topping of slaw-like curtido cuts through the fat and salt for a satisfying meal.It’s a flavor that’s endured through the centuries. At the UNESCO-listed site of Joya de Cerén, a Maya city buried by an erupting volcano, archaeologists have found cooking tools like those used to make pupusas that date to around 600 A.D.A constellation of bubbles pocks injera’s spongy surface, making this Ethiopian bread the perfect foil for the country’s rich sauces and stews.Also beloved in neighboring Eritrea and Somalia, injera is both a mealtime staple and the ultimate utensil – tear off tender pieces of moist, rolled-up bread to scoop food served on a communal platter.Made from an ancient – and ultra-nutritious – grain called teff, injera has a characteristically sour taste. It’s the result of a fermentation process that starts by blending fresh batter with cultures from a previous batch, then leaving the mixture to grow more flavorful over several days.The French may frown on eating on the go, but there’s an unofficial exception for “le quignon,” the crisp-baked end of a slender baguette.You’re allowed to break that off and munch it as you walk down the street – perhaps because the baguette has pride of place as a symbol of French culture.But like some of the greatest traditions, the baguette is a relatively recent invention.According to Paris food historian Jim Chevallier, long, narrow breads similar to modern baguettes gained prominence in the 19th century, and the first official mention is in a 1920 price list. (French President Emmanuel Macron nonetheless argues that the baguette deserves UNESCO status.)Bubbling with fresh imeruli and sulguni cheeses, khachapuri might be the country of Georgia’s most beloved snack.The savory flatbread starts with soft, yeasted dough that’s pinched into a boat-shaped cradle, then baked with a generous filling of egg and cheese. An elongated shape maximizes the contrast in texture, from the tender interior to crisp, brown tips. Khachapuri experts know to break off the ends for swabbing in the rich, oozing filling.It’s such a key feature of Georgian cuisine that the Khachapuri Index is one measure of the country’s economic welfare; and in 2019, the country’s National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation named traditional khachapuri as UNESCO Intangible Heritage of Georgia.Pure rye flour lends these iconic north German loaves impressive heft, along with a distinctive, mahogany hue.The most traditional versions are baked in a warm, steamy oven for up to 24 hours. It’s an unusual technique that helps transform sugars in the rye flour, turning naturally occurring sweetness into depth of flavor.Pumpernickel has been a specialty in Germany’s Westphalia region for hundreds of years, and there’s even a family-owned bakery in the town of Soest that’s made the hearty bread using the same recipe since 1570.Hong Kong bakers outdo each other by crafting the softest, fluffiest breads imaginable, turning wheat flour into pillowy confections.Pai bao might be loftier than all the rest, thanks to a technique known as the Tangzhong method.When mixing the wheat dough, bakers add a small amount of cooked flour and water to the rest of the ingredients, a minor change with major impact on the bread’s structural development. The results? A wonderfully tender loaf that retains moisture for days, with a milky flavor that invites snacking out of hand.The simmering, geothermal heat that powers Iceland’s geysers, hot springs and steam vents also provides a natural oven for this slow-baked Icelandic rye bread.Made with dark rye flour, the dough is enclosed in a metal pot before it’s buried in the warm ground near geothermal springs and other hotspots. When baked in the traditional method, dökkt rúgbrauð takes a full 24 hours to cook in the subterranean “oven.”It’s an ingenious use of an explosive natural resource, and in the hot-springs town of Laugarvatn, visitors can try loaves of dökkt rúgbrauð when it’s fresh from a hole in the black sand.Flatbreads go wonderfully flaky in this whole-wheat Indian treat, which can be eaten plain or studded with savory fillings.Folding and rolling the dough over thinly spread fat creates sumptuous layers that are rich with flavor, employing a technique similar to that used for croissants or puff pastry.Stuffed wheat bread has been made in India for hundreds of years, and several varieties even get a shout-out in the “Manasollasa,” a 12th-century Sanskrit text that contains some of the earliest written descriptions of the region’s food.Palm sugar and cinnamon lend a light, aromatic sweetness to roti gambang, a tender wheat bread that’s an old-fashioned favorite at Jakarta bakeries.The name evokes the gambang, a traditional Indonesian instrument with a resemblance to the slender, brown loaves.For the recipe, though, cooks look back to the colonial era: From spiced holiday cookies to cheese sticks topped with Gouda or Edam, Indonesian baking has adapted Dutch ingredients and techniques to local tastes.It takes a pair of deft bakers to craft this addictive Iranian flatbread, which is cooked directly on a bed of hot pebbles.That blazing-hot surface pocks the wheat dough with golden blisters, and it gives sangak – also known as nan-e sangak – a characteristic chewiness.If you’re lucky enough to taste sangak hot from the oven, enjoy a heavenly contrast of crisp crust and tender crumb. Eat the flatbread on its own, or turn it into an Iranian-style breakfast: Use a piece of sangak to wrap salty cheese and a bundle of aromatic green herbs.You don’t need yeast to get lofty bread: Chemical leavening can add air through an explosive combination of acidic and basic ingredients. While Native Americans used refined potash to leaven griddled breads – an early example of chemical leavening – this version became popular during the lean years of the Irish Potato Famine.With potato crops failing, impoverished Irish people started mixing loaves using soft wheat flour, sour milk and baking soda.Now, dense loaves of soda bread are a nostalgic treat that’s a perfect pairing with salted Irish butter.If you think challah is limited to pillowy, braided loaves, think again – traditionally, challah is any bread used in Jewish ritual.And Jewish bakers have long made breads as diverse as the diaspora itself: Think blistered flatbreads, hearty European loaves and Hungarian confections dotted with poppy seeds.Israel’s modern-day bakers draw on that rich heritage. But on Friday afternoons in Tel Aviv, you’ll still spot plenty of the classic Ashkenazi versions that many people in the United States know as challah.Those golden loaves are tender with eggs, and shiny under a generous glaze. It’s the braid, though, that catches the eye. By wrapping dough strands together, bakers create 12 distinctive mounds said to represent 12 loaves in the ancient Temple of Jerusalem.Between an emphasis on “ancient grains” and centuries of floury traditions, it can seem like breadmaking is stuck in the past.But bread is continually evolving, and there’s no better example than this iconic Italian loaf, which was only invented in the 1980s.In 1982, Italian baker Arnaldo Cavallari created the low, chewy loaf in defiance of the baguette-style breads he saw taking over Roman bakeries.It was a watershed moment in the comeback of artisanal breads, which has roots in the 1960s and 1970s backlash against the increasingly industrialized food system.Pan-fried cassava cakes are delicious comfort food in Jamaica, where rounds of bammy bread are a hearty pairing for the island’s ultra-fresh seafood.The traditional process for making bammy bread starts with processing grated cassava to get rid of naturally occurring cyanide; next, sifted cassava pulp is pressed into metal rings.It’s a recipe with ancient roots – cassava has been a staple in South America and the Caribbean since long before the arrival of Europeans here, and it’s believed that the native Arawak people used the root to make flatbreads as well.Yeasted wheat dough makes a convenient package for Japanese curry, turning a sit-down meal into a snack that can be eaten out of hand.Kare pan, or curry bread, is rolled in panko before a dunk in the deep fryer, ensuring a crispy crust that provides maximum textural contrast with the soft, saucy interior.Kare pan is so beloved that there’s even a crime-fighting superhero named for the savory treat: A star of the anime series “Soreike! Anpanman,” Karepanman fights villains by shooting out a burning-hot curry filling.Follow the aroma of baking bread in Amman, and you’ll find bakers in roadside stalls stacking this classic flatbread into steaming piles.When shaping taboon, bakers press rounds of soft, wheat dough over a convex form, then slap them onto the interior of a conical clay oven.What emerges is a chewy round that’s crackling with steam, wafting a rich smell of grain and smoke. It’s the ideal foil for a plate of Jordanian mouttabal, a roasted eggplant dip that’s blended with ground sesame seeds and yogurt.Roti flatbread may have arrived in Malaysia with Indian immigrants, but the country’s made the flaky, rich bread their own.When cooked on a hot griddle, roti canai puffs into a stack of overlapping layers rich with buttery flavor. Irresistible when served with Malaysian dips and curries, roti canai becomes a meal all its own with the addition of stuffings from sweet, ripe bananas to fried eggs.The tawny crust of Malta’s sourdough gives way to a pillow-soft interior, ideal for rubbing with a fresh tomato or soaking up the islands’ prized olive oils.Classic versions take more than a day to prepare, and were traditionally baked in shared, wood-fired ovens that served as community gathering places.Even now that few Maltese bake their own bread, Ħobż tal-Malti has a powerful symbolism for the Mediterranean island nation.When trying to discover someone’s true nature, a Maltese person might ask “x’ħobz jiekol dan?,” literally, “what kind of bread does he eat?”Thin rounds of corn dough turn blistered and brown on a hot comal, the traditional griddles that have been used in Mexico since at least 700 BCE.Whether folded into a taco or eaten out of hand, corn tortillas are one of the country’s most universally loved foods. The ground-corn dough is deceptively simple; made from just a few ingredients, it’s nonetheless a triumph of culinary ingenuity.Before being ground, the corn is mixed with an alkaline ingredient such as lime, a process called nixtamalization that makes the grain more nutritious and easier to digest.Follow the rich scent of baking bread through a Moroccan medina, and you may find yourself at one of the communal neighborhood ovens called ferran. This is where locals bring rounds of tender wheat dough ready to bake into khobz kesra, one of the country’s homiest breads.The low, rounded loaves have a slightly crisp exterior that earns them pride of place on the Moroccan table, where their fluffy texture is ideal for absorbing aromatic tajine sauce.Golden, crisp rounds of fry bread are a taste of home for many in the Navajo Nation, as well as a reminder of a tragic history.When Navajo people were forced out of their Arizona lands by the US government in 1864, they resettled in New Mexican landscapes where growing traditional crops of beans and vegetables proved difficult.To survive, they used government-provided stores of white flour, lard and sugar, creating fry bread out of stark necessity.Now, fry bread is a symbol of perseverance and tradition, and a favorite treat everywhere from powwows to family gatherings.Putting the “Dutch” in Dutch crunch, tijgerbrood is a crust-lover’s masterpiece in every crispy bite.To create the mottled top of tijgerbrood, bakers spread unbaked loaves of white bread with a soft mixture of rice flour, sesame oil, water and yeast.Heat transforms the exterior into a crispy pattern of snackable pieces, and loaves of tijgerbrood are beloved for sandwiches. (An ocean away from Amsterdam’s Old World bakeries, San Francisco has made Dutch crunch its sandwich bread of choice as well.)When European settlers brought potatoes and wheat to New Zealand, indigenous Maori people made the imported ingredients their own with this innovative bread.To mix the dough, potatoes are boiled then fermented into a sourdough-like starter that gives the finished bread a sweet-and-sour taste.Now, rēwena parāoa is a favorite treat when layered with butter and jam or served with a hearty portion of raw fish, a longtime delicacy for Maori people.If you don’t think of northern Europe as flatbread country, you haven’t tasted lefse.The Norwegian potato flatbread is a favorite at holidays, when there are many hands to roll the soft dough with a grooved pin, then cook it on a hot griddle. For a taste of Norwegian comfort food, eat a warm lefse spiraled with butter, sugar and a dash of cinnamon.While potatoes are just an 18th-century addition to the Norwegian diet, Scandinavian flatbread is at least as old as the Vikings.Slather a hot round of podplomyk with white cheese and fruit preserves for a taste of old-fashioned, Polish home cooking.The unyeasted flatbread is blistered brown. With ingredients limited to wheat flour, salt and water, podplomyk is a deliciously simple entry in the sprawling family tree of flatbreads.Since dough for podplomyk is rolled thin, it was traditionally baked before other loaves are ready for the oven. In the Middle Ages, the portable breads were shared with neighbors and household members as a sign of friendship. (Today, that tradition is carried on with the exchange of oplatek wafers at Christmastime.)Corn and buckwheat are stone-milled, sifted and kneaded in a wooden trough for the most traditional version of this hearty peasant bread from northern Portugal.When the loaves are baked in wood-fired, stone ovens, an archipelago of floury crust shards expands over deep cracks. The ovens themselves are sealed with bread dough, which acts as a natural oven timer: The bread is ready when the dough strips turn toasty brown.Europeans didn’t taste corn until they arrived in the Americas, but it would be eagerly adopted in northern Portuguese regions where soil conditions are poorly suited to growing wheat.Bread baking becomes art on Russian holidays, when golden loaves of karavai are decked in dough flowers, animals and swirls.The bread plays a starring role at weddings, with elaborate rules to govern the baking process: Traditionally, a happily married woman must mix the dough, and a married man slides the round loaf into the oven.Even the round shape has an ancient symbolism and is thought to date back to ancient sun worship. Now, it’s baked to ensure health and prosperity for a new couple.Once part of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, this mountainous island’s cuisine remains distinct from mainland Italy. Among the most iconic foods here is pane carasau, parchment-thin flatbread with a melodic nickname: carta de musica, or sheet music.While pane carasau starts like a classic flatbread, there’s a Sardinian twist that makes it an ideal traveling companion; after the flatbreads puff up in the oven, they’re sliced horizontally into two thinner pieces. Those pieces are baked a second time, drying out the bread enough to last for months.Warm squares of Serbian proja, or cornbread, are a favorite accompaniment to the country’s lush meat stews.It’s a homey dish that’s often cooked fresh for family meals, then served hot from the oven. Ground corn offers a lightly sweet foil to salty toppings, from salty kajmak cheese to a scattering of cracklings.There’s buried treasure within every loaf of gyeran-ppang, individually sized wheat breads with a whole egg baked inside.Translating simply to “egg bread,” gyeran-ppang is a favorite in the streets of Seoul, eaten hot for breakfast – or at any other time of day.The addition of ham, cheese and chopped parsley adds a savory twist to the sweet-and-salty treat, a belly-warming snack that keeps South Korea fueled through the country’s long winters.A thin, fermented batter of rice flour and coconut milk turns crisp in the bowl-shaped pans used for cooking appam, one of Sri Lanka’s most ubiquitous treats.Often called hoppers, this whisper-thin pancake is best eaten hot – preferably while standing around a Colombo street food stall.Favorite toppings for appam in Sri Lanka include coconut sambal and chicken curry, or you can order one with egg. For egg hoppers, a whole egg is cracked into the center of an appam, then topped with a richly aromatic chili paste. Appam is also popular in southern India.Overnight fermentation lends a delicious tang to this Sudanese flatbread, balancing the mild, earthy flavor of sorghum flour with a tart bite.Making the crepe-like kisra takes practice and patience, but perfect the art of cooking these on a flat metal pan and you’ll be in for a classic Sudanese treat.Like Ethiopian injera, kisra is both staple food and an edible utensil – use pieces of the spongy bread to scoop up spicy bites of the hearty stews that are some of Sudan’s most beloved foods.Before commercial yeast was available, brewers and bakers worked in tandem: Brewers harvested yeast from their batches of beer, passing it off to bakers whose bread would be infused with a light beer flavor.That legacy lives on in Sweden’s vörtlimpa: Limpa means loaf, while vört refers to a tart dose of brewer’s wort. Known as limpa bread in English, the light rye now gets acidity from orange juice, not brewers wort.Crops of cold-hardy barley have thrived on the Tibetan Plateau for thousands of years, and the grain has long been a staple of high-altitude diets there.While balep korkun is often made with wheat, traditional versions of this flatbread are shaped from tsampa, a roasted barley flour with nutty flavor.That rich-tasting flour is so central to Tibetan identity that it’s been turned into a hashtag and been called out in rap songs. (The Dalai Lama even eats it for breakfast.)Dredged in sesame seeds and spiraled into rings, simit might be Turkey’s ultimate on-the-go treat.A few decades ago, vendors wound through the Istanbul streets carrying trays piled high with the breads, but roving bread-sellers are now rare in the capital.Instead, commuters pick up their daily simit at roadside stands, where the deep-colored rings are stacked by the dozen. A burnished crust infuses the breads with a light sweetness – before sliding into wood fired ovens, simit is dunked in sugar-water or thinned molasses, a slick glaze that turns to caramel in the intense heat.Yeasted wheat batter bubbles into a spongy cake for this griddled treat, a British favorite when smeared with jam, butter or clotted cream.Ring molds contain the pourable batter on an oiled griddle, which cooks one side of each crumpet to a golden hue. Like Eastern European zwieback and crisp rusks, crumpets are mostly eaten as a twice-baked bread – the rounds are split and toasted before serving.Smeared with butter or dripping in gravy, biscuits are one of the United States’ homiest tastes. That’s not to say they’re easy to make: Achieving soft, fluffy biscuits requires quick hands and gentle mixing.In the antebellum South, biscuits were seen as a special treat for Sunday dinner. These days they’re nearly ubiquitous, from gas station barbecue joints to home-cooked meals.Part of the secret is in the flour, typically a low-protein flour like White Lily. The soft wheat used for White Lily was long grown in Southern states – before long-distance food shipping. (It’s now milled in the Midwest.)Flatbreads become art in Uzbekistan’s traditional tandoor ovens, which turn out rounds adorned with twists, swirls and stamps.Uzbek non varies across regions, from Tashkent’s chewy versions to Samarkand loaves showered in black nigella seeds. As soon as the breads emerge from the oven, they’re turned over to a swarm of bicycle messengers who ferry the hot loaves to markets and cafes.Areperos – Venezuelan arepa-makers – pat golden rounds of corn dough onto hot griddles to give the plump flatbreads a deliciously toasted crust and tender, steaming interior.Arepas have been made in Venezuela and surrounding regions since long before the arrival of Europeans in South America, and the nourishing corn breads can range from simple to elaborate.At breakfast, try them split and buttered. Stuffed with savory fillings, creamy sauces and fiery salsa, arepas can become a hearty meal all their own.A family tree of flatbreads stretches across the Middle East and beyond, but Yemen’s Jewish community’s version is a richer treat than most.To make malawach, bakers roll wheat dough into a delicate sheet and fold it over a slick of melted butter. The dough is twisted into a loose topknot, then re-rolled, sending veins of butter through overlapping layers.When the pan-fried dough emerges steaming from the stovetop, a final shower of black nigella or sesame seeds add texture and savory crunch."

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Bordered by China, Afghanistan, Iran and India – and with a population of more than 200 million people – it’s no surprise that Pakistan is a country of geographical and linguistic diversity.However, there’s common ground to be found in Pakistan’s food.Pakistanis are passionate about their cuisine, which is full of flavor and bursting with color. And they love to eat.Here are some of the best dishes to try:These easy-to-make crispy, fried fritters are a classic finger food served as a starter or a side dish.Vegetables are thinly sliced before being soaked in a seasoned and spice gram flour batter and then fried for a few minutes.Grab them while they are hot. If you prefer a meatier option, fish pakoras are also a favorite.Served as a snack or appetizer, there are many types of kebabs in Pakistani cuisine.There’s the popular seekh kebab, which is ground meat grilled on skewers.We also recommend the chapli kebab – so called because it is thought to be shaped like a chappal (sandal) – and the shami kebab, which features small patties made with minced meat mixed with split chickpeas, finely chopped onion, mint, green chili and egg to hold it all together.This popular street food was once sold by cart-pushing vendors who would sing out their presence while hawking their wares. While the advent of more snack food restaurants has made this less common, the popularity of the gol gappa has not waned.The round shell is made with semolina and fried. Once it cools and becomes brittle, a hole is created and filled with a mixture of tamarind chutney, chili, chaat masala, potato, onion and chickpeas. It is served with a bowl of spicy tamarind dip.Thought to have developed in the royal kitchens of the 16th-19th century Mughal Empire, this rice dish is often served on special occasions.It can be made with lamb or beef but chicken biryani is a favorite.The meat and rice are cooked separately before being layered and cooked together with an assortment of spices.Warm and comforting, this dish may look simple enough but a combination of lentils, wheat, barley and minced beef (or other preferred meat) is slow-cooked for hours in gentle spices.The sticky consistency is achieved by constant stirring.Paya literally translates to trotters and this warming goat curry, with a soup-like consistency, is often eaten on cold winter mornings.Again, slow-cooking will ensure that all of the spices have been infused into the perfectly tender meat.This Pakistani favorite, often served to guests on special occasions, consists of slow-cooked lamb shank – including the bone marrow.It used to be left to simmer overnight to be served at sunrise.These days, most people cook it for a few hours but the longer the better.Pakistani cuisine may seem meat-heavy but there are plenty of great vegetarian options. The word “tarka” refers to the process used when finishing off a lentil dish, so in essence, tarka daal can be made with several different daals.When the lentils are thoroughly cooked, the tarka is applied – onions, cumin seeds and crushed garlic cloves are fried until brown in a separate pan and added to the daal without stirring. It should make a sizzling sound as the tarka mixture hits the lentils.Packed with protein and fiber, black-eyed peas curry – lobia daal – is a particularly healthy option as well as a tasty one.Peas are soaked overnight for best results and the curry is made with a tomato base.It’s best eaten with roti (flatbread), in which case the curry sauce should be kept a little thicker, or with rice.Bitter melon is thought to have a range of health benefits including purifying the blood, lowering blood sugar and boosting the immune system, which is why most Pakistanis have childhood memories of being persuaded to eat it by their parents despite its sour taste.In Pakistan, it’s cooked with onions, red chili powder, turmeric, salt, coriander powder and a pinch of cumin seeds.Eggplant curry is so simple and quick to make.A masala base is created by frying onions, garlic and ginger, mixing in chili powder, salt, turmeric and cumin seeds. Chopped eggplant is then added, potatoes too if wanted, and water before the concoction is left to cook for 15-20 minutes.Roasting the eggplant in the oven beforehand gives the dish a smoky flavor.Equally as simple and a Pakistani favorite, this potato and cauliflower curry is from Punjab province.The trick is to make sure the potatoes and cauliflower florets cook at the right time.Cutting the latter to a slightly bigger size than the potatoes ensures the florets don’t disintegrate before the potatoes are done.Pakistanis make a range of perfect melt-in-your-mouth flatbreads including roti and naans but the paratha, made with clarified butter is a particularly delicious indulgence.Eaten for breakfast, you can go for the plain option but there are also various fillings to choose from including mincemeat, potato or the mooli paratha – made with a radish filling.Also known as gajar ka halwa, this dish is made using a combination of grated carrots, nuts, milk, sugar and clarified butter.Best served with a scoop of ice cream on the side, this flavorful but light dessert often makes an appearance at weddings and parties.Traditionally served on special occasions, this brightly colored sweet rice is a Pakistani favorite.Made with sugar, milk and food coloring and flavored with cardamoms, raisins, pistachios and almonds, zarda is either yellow or made with various food colorings to give it a multicolor effect.Keer is another dessert eaten at weddings or on celebratory occasions such as Eid al Fitr, the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.This is a thick and creamy rice pudding-type dish that is slow-cooked using milk, rice and sugar and infused with cardamom.It’s topped with crushed pistachios and tastes equally delicious whether eaten hot or cold.A breakfast of champions, this combination of a poori (deep-fried bread), which is light and fluffy, is served with the rich-tasting halwa (made with wheat semolina, sugar and butter) and channa (a chickpea curry).It’s often consumed on Eid morning but can also be found as a street food breakfast or brunch option.In the intense heat of summer, this refreshing dessert is a popular choice. An unusual concoction made with an array of ingredients including milk, rose syrup, ice cream and jelly, it also contains vermicelli and basil seeds.It’s believed the basil seeds have a cooling effect on the body.Pink tea, also known as Kashmiri tea, is a traditional beverage made with tea leaves, salt, milk and a pinch of baking soda to give it its distinctive pastel color.Often, it’s topped with crushed pistachios and served with nuts and dried fruit.This dessert masquerading as a drink offers the perfect excuse to put several away during a meal.Lassi is yogurt-based and can come in a variety of flavors, but there’s nothing quite as refreshing as a cold mango lassi on a hot day."

        "title": "World’s best spicy foods: 20 dishes to try",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Some like it hot – and some like it hotter, still.When it comes to the world’s best spicy dishes, we have some of the world’s hottest peppers to thank, along with incredible layers of flavor and a long, spice-loving human history.“Spicy food, or at least spiced foods, clearly predates the idea of countries and their cuisine by a very, very long time,” says Indian author Saurav Dutt, who is writing a book about the spiciest foods on the Indian subcontinent.“Every spicy ingredient has a wild ancestor,” he says. “Ginger, horseradish, mustard, chiles and so on have predecessors which led to their domestication.”Hunter-gatherer groups historically made use of various wild ingredients to flavor their foods, Dutt says, and there are many ingredients all over the world that can lend a spicy taste to a dish or stand on their own.Peppers – a headliner for heat – are rated on the Scoville Heat Units scale, which measures capsaicin and other active components of chile peppers. By that measure, the Carolina Reaper is among the hottest in the world, while habaneros, Scotch bonnets and bird’s eye chiles drop down a few rungs on the mop-your-brow scale.Redolent with ghost peppers, Scotch bonnets, serranos, chiltepin peppers, mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns and more, the following spicy dishes from around the world bring the heat in the most delicious way.Ata rodo – Scotch bonnet pepper – brings the fire to Nigeria’s famous spicy soup. Egusi is made by pounding the seeds from the egusi melon, an indigenous West African fruit that’s related to the watermelon.In addition to being protein-packed, the melon’s seeds serve to thicken and add texture and flavor to the soup’s mix of meat, seafood and leafy vegetables. Pounded yams are often served alongside this dish, helping to temper the scorch of the Scotch bonnets.“The joy of this dish is not only the delightful warming ingredients of cinnamon, cloves, star anise and, of course, the Sichuan peppercorns, but the fact that you can cook exactly what you like in the bubbling spicy broth,” says British-born Chinese chef Kwoklyn Wan, author of “The Complete Chinese Takeout Cookbook.”Duck, seafood, chicken, pork, lamb and seasonal vegetables are all fair game for tossing into the pot to simmer in a mouth-numbing broth made with Sichuan peppercorns and dried Sichuan peppers for serious kick (the dipping sauce served on the side often has chile paste, too).Also known as Chongqing hot pot, the dish is said to have originated as a popular food among Yangtze River boatmen. It’s enjoyed by those who can handle its heat all over China, not to mention elsewhere around the world.From northeastern Thailand’s spice-loving Isaan province, this fresh and fiery salad is a staple dish at Thai restaurants around the world and is also popular in neighboring Laos.Som tam turns to green (unripe) papaya for its main ingredient, which is usually julienned or shredded for the salad. The papaya is then tossed with long beans or green beans and a mix of flavorful Asian essentials that include tamarind juice, dried shrimp, fish sauce and sugar cane paste, among other ingredients. Thai chiles, also called bird’s eye chiles, give the salad its requisite kick.The Portuguese introduced this spicy dish also known as peri-peri chicken into Angola and Mozambique as far back as the 15th century, when they mixed African chiles with European ingredients (piri-piri means “pepper pepper” in Swahili). And it’s the perky red pepper of the same name that brings the spiciness to this complex, layered and delicious dish.Piri-piri chicken’s poultry cuts are marinated in chiles, olive oil, lemon, garlic and herbs such as basil and oregano for a fiery flavor that blends salty, sour and sweet. The dish is also popular in Namibia and South Africa, where it’s often found on the menu in Portuguese restaurants.The glossy red hues dancing on a plate of this popular pork dish, a version of which hails from Mao Zedong’s home province, give a hint about the mouth experience to come. The dish was apparently a favorite of the communist leader, who requested his chefs in Beijing prepare it for him.Chairman Mao’s braised pork belly – called Mao shi hong shao rou in China – is often served as the main dish for sharing at a family table and is made by braising chunks of pork belly with soy sauce, dried chiles and spices.“It is a very delicious and moreish dish due to the caramelized sugar and dark soy sauce being reduced and all the aromatics (that coat the pork belly),” wrote BBC “Best Home Cook” winner Suzie Lee, author of “Simply Chinese,” in an email to CNN Travel.Jamaica’s favorite pepper is the Scotch bonnet, beloved not just for its spiciness but for its aroma, colors and flavor, too, says Mark Harvey, content creator and podcaster at Two On An Island, who was born in Spanish Town, Jamaica.“For Jamaicans, the degree of spiciness starts at medium for children and goes up to purple hot,” he says, explaining that the peppers come in green, orange, red and purple hues, growing increasingly spicy in that order.Scotch bonnets star in several of the island’s iconic dishes, including escovitch fish, pepper pot soup and curry goat. But you might recognize them most from the ubiquitous jerk chicken and pork smoking roadside everywhere from Montego Bay to Boston Bay, where meat prepared with the peppery marinade is cooked the traditional way, atop coals from pimento tree wood (the tree’s allspice berries are also used in the jerk marinade).Popular on the Indonesian islands of Bali and Lombok, in particular, this whole chicken dish is stuffed with an intensely aromatic spice paste (betutu) that usually includes a mashup of fresh hot chile peppers, galangal (a root related to ginger), candlenuts, shallots, garlic, turmeric and shrimp paste, among other ingredients.The chicken is then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed, bringing the aromatics out all the more and flavoring the chicken to the max. Best shared, ayam betutu is often presented at religious ceremonies in Bali, but you’ll find it at restaurants specializing in it throughout the islands, too.Beer and buffalo chicken wings are as American as, well, hamburgers. And if you’re not eating them alongside a pile of celery sticks and a ramekin of dunking sauce – traditionally blue cheese dip, but ranch works, too – you’re missing half the picture.A sports bar staple at chain restaurants such as Buffalo Wild Wings and more refined outposts, too, from Alaska to Maine, “wings” are actually made up of the wing parts called drumettes and wingettes, which have the most meat.Buffalo wings, said to have been invented in a bar in Buffalo, New York, in 1964, are among the spiciest preparations (other popular variations include teriyaki wings and honey garlic wings). Make them as fiery as you like using a sauce that includes cayenne pepper, butter, vinegar, garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce.Similar to ceviche but with more bite, this raw marinated shrimp dish from the western Mexican state of Sinaloa (and a staple along the Baja Peninsula, too) tastes as good as it looks.Tiny but mighty chiltepín peppers (they look like bright little berries), grown throughout the United States and Mexico, make the spicy magic happen in shrimp aguachiles, which means “pepper water.” If you can’t find those, serrano and jalapeño peppers also do the trick.Marinate the raw shrimp with ingredients including lime juice, cilantro, red onion and cucumber and enjoy with crispy tostadas.A go-to dish when you want something satisfying – but with kick – pad ka prao is a mealtime staple in Thailand, where you’ll find it on offer at street-side stalls and restaurants everywhere from Bangkok to the islands.Considered the Thai equivalent of a sandwich or a burger, the dish is a mix of ground pork, spicy Thai chile peppers and holy basil and can be ordered as spicy as you like. Many locals believe it’s best topped with a fried egg with a runny yolk.A fiery favorite that originated in West Sumatra, versions of beef rendang are also enjoyed in Indonesia’s neighboring countries, including Malaysia and Brunei, as well as the Philippines.This flavorful dry curry dish calls on kaffir lime leaves, coconut milk, star anise and red chile, among other spices, to deliver its complexity. It’s often presented to guests and served during festive events.The fermented cabbage dish kimchi might be the spicy Korean dish that first comes to mind, but when you want some extra kick, dakdoritang does the trick.Comfort food to the max, the chicken stew doubles down on its spiciness with liberal doses of gochugaru (Korean chile powder) and gochujang (Korean chile paste) mixed with rice wine, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and sesame oil in a braising sauce that packs the bone-in chicken pieces with flavor. It’s often served with carrots, onions and potatoes.This tomato-based British-Asian curry invented in Birmingham, England, curry houses by British Bangladeshi restaurateurs is thought to be one of the spiciest curries in the world.“Typically the sauce has a tomato base with ginger, fennel seeds and copious amounts of chile, habanero or Scotch bonnet, peppers,” says Indian author Saurav Dutt.As many as 10 pepper types may find their way into phaal curry, he says, including bird’s eye chiles and the bhut jolokia (also known as the ghost pepper, it’s one of the world’s hottest peppers). Even hotter than vindaloo, this dish will absolutely light your mouth up.This classic Roman pasta dish’s name gives you an idea of what to expect. “Arrabbiata” means “angry” in Italian. And penne all’arrabbiata pairs the relatively plain penne pasta with fiery flavors from the sauce (sugo all’arrabbiata) in which it’s slathered.“The peperoncino (red chile pepper) is what makes this sauce ‘angry’ (arrabbiata) or spicy,” Chris MacLean of Italy-based Open Tuesday Wines said via email.To tame the angry peppers in this garlic and tomato-based dish with a good glass of red wine, MacLean says to pair penne all’arrabbiata with a Cesanese, also from Rome’s Lazio region, with its crisp fruit and light tannins.“A wine that’s heavy in oak or alcohol would turn up the heat (in the dish) in your mouth and render the wine tasteless,” he warns.“There’s a saying in South India that you are lucky to ‘eat like a Chettiar,’ ” says Dutt, referring to the Tamil-speaking community in India’s southern Tamil Nadu state credited with creating this spicy dish.“Like this chicken dish, the traditional Chettinad dishes mostly used locally sourced spices like star anise, pepper, kalpasi (stone flower) and marati mokku (dried flower pods),” he says.The chicken pieces are simmered in a medley of roasted spices and coconut, and it is traditionally served with steamed rice or the thin South Indian pancakes called dosa, fried chapati or naan.The fiery Ethiopian spice blend called berbere – aromatic with chile peppers, basil, cardamom, garlic and ginger – is instrumental to the flavor chorus that’s doro wat, Ethiopia’s much-loved spicy chicken stew.Topped with boiled eggs, the dish almost always finds a place at the table during weddings, religious holidays and other special occasions and family gatherings. If you’re invited to try it in Ethiopia at such an event, consider yourself very lucky indeed.Mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns bring the X-factor to this popular dish from China’s Sichuan province, which mixes chunks of silken tofu with ground meat (pork or beef) and a spicy fermented bean paste called doubanjiang.Mapo tofu’s fiery red color might as well be a warning to the uninitiated – Sichuan cuisine’s defining flavor, málà, has a numbing effect on the mouth called paresthesia that people tend to love or hate.A Portuguese-influenced dish from India’s southwestern state of Goa, vindaloo was not originally meant to be spicy, says Dutt. “It originally contained pork, potatoes (aloo) and vinegar (vin), giving you the name,” he says.But when the dish was exported to curry houses in the United Kingdom that were mostly run by Muslim Bangladeshi chefs, Dutt says, pork was replaced with beef, chicken or lamb and the dish evolved into a spicier hot curry.Ghost pepper flakes and Scotch bonnet peppers are among the peppers giving the dish its scorching taste. But in Goa, you can still find versions of the dish that swing more on the side of milder spices such as cinnamon and cardamom.Senegalese cooks are also big fans of Scotch bonnet peppers, named for their resemblance to the Scottish tam o’ shanter hat. And their spice-giving goodness is deployed liberally in one of the West African country’s favorite dishes, the spicy tomato and peanut or groundnut-based stew called mafé.Usually made with beef, lamb or chicken, the stew is made even heartier with potatoes, carrots and other root vegetables for one filling feed. Mafé is popular in other West African countries, too, including Mali and Gambia, and it can also be prepared without meat.Synonymous with watching the Super Bowl or hunkering down on a cold night, chili is a spicy American staple where you can opt to ratchet up the heat as much as you like.There are basically two pure forms of American chili – with or without beans (usually red kidney beans) – says Chef Julian Gonzalez of Sawmill Market in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In Texas, he explains, chili traditionally doesn’t have beans, which puts the focus on the spices and chiles used to flavor it, and he goes with that approach himself.“Traditionally chili is seasoned with chili powder, cumin and paprika,” Gonzalez says. From there, you can use other ingredients to make your recipe unique. Adding cayenne pepper is one way to turn up the heat.At his restaurant Red & Green, which serves New Mexican cuisine, Gonzalez’s green chile stew, made with pork and no beans, is seasoned with a mix of roasted green New Mexican hatch chiles (half mild and half with heat), onion and garlic powder."

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "The rumors have finally been confirmed – season three of HBO hit TV series “The White Lotus” is coming to Thailand.In statements released this week, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) and HBO announced filming on the show, created by Mike White, is scheduled to begin in February in Bangkok, Phuket and Ko Samui.Though the third installment of the satirical dark comedy-drama isn’t set to air until 2025, the TAT is already anticipating the glow of the “White Lotus” spotlight and has teamed up with HBO for the filming and promotion of the award-winnnng show.“We are honored to have amazing Thailand featured as the filming location for the highly anticipated upcoming season of ‘The White Lotus,’” said Thapanee Kiatphaibool, TAT Governor, in a press release.“The kingdom’s exotic natural beauty, rich historical sites and diverse landscapes are the perfect settings to share our fascinating culture, fantastic cuisine, top-notch wellness and luxury offerings, and most importantly our people and Thai hospitality.”Janet Graham Borba, EVP of production at HBO & Max, also commented on the tieup, saying in a statement: “We are pleased to partner with the Tourism Authority of Thailand to execute Mike’s creative vision and showcase all that the beautiful country of Thailand has to offer, as the next group of guests check in to the White Lotus.”The selection of Thailand, one of the world’s most famous tourist destinations, is certainly fitting. As fans of the hugely popular show know, seasons one and two were set in luxury hotels in two stunning places – Hawaii and Sicily.In both seasons, guests and employees at a luxurious resort experience a transformative week, as the truths behind the characters’ seemingly idyllic lives are exposed.Four Seasons properties represented the fictional White Lotus resort in both destinations.During season one, viewers were transported to the stunning Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea. For season two, the show headed to clifftop San Domenico Palace, a five-star resort operated by Four Seasons in the town of Taormina, Sicily.This has led to much online speculation in recent months that season three will be set in one of Thailand’s four Four Seasons properties, which are located in Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Koh Samui and Bangkok.For now, the luxury hotel resort brand isn’t confirming or denying the rumors – a press representative told CNN Travel they aren’t commenting at the moment.There’s one potential clue, though: The Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui website shows there’s no availability at the resort whatsoever from early February through to the last week of March.When season one of “White Lotus” ended, many fans were disappointed to learn that the characters would not be coming back for round two. In the end, Jennifer Coolidge returned to play clueless but beloved wealthy traveler Tanya.HBO has once again announced a new list of actors for season three of the anthology, but is also bringing back Natasha Rothwell to reprise her role as Belinda, who played spa manager at the White Lotus resort in Hawaii.Other season three cast members announced by HBO - which, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery - include Jason Isaacs, Michelle Monaghan, Parker Posey, Leslie Bibb, Dom Hetrakul and Tayme Thapthimthong."

        "title": "These US cities will pay you up to $15,000 to move there",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Life in the United States is pretty expensive these days. Between seemingly eternal inflation, high interest rates, and the exorbitant cost of healthcare, many Americans are looking for ways to keep more hard-earned dollars in their bank account.One option gaining traction? Relocation packages offered by some US smaller cities and towns to attract new residents.Also known as worker relocation incentive programs, these cash carrots are available across the country but share the same general premise: lure workers who have geographic flexibility with financial incentives and other perks, such as free gym memberships, co-working facilities, and even dinner with the mayor. A couple of the most lucrative offers hit five figures, and some also offer homebuyer incentives.According to MakeMyMove.com, an online marketplace connecting remote workers with locations making offers around the US, the number of cities offering such incentives has more than doubled in recent years. The pandemic brought about a seismic change in work culture and, in 2023, more than 50,000 people applied for programs across the country through the platform.However, the pay-to-move concept isn’t popular with everyone. “These programs can sometimes lead to discontent among local residents, who may feel overlooked in favor of new arrivals receiving incentives,” says Kyle Samuels, CEO of Creative Talent Endeavors, a boutique executive search firm based in Charlotte, North Carolina. “This could foster community divisions and potentially increase the cost of living, making it harder for long-term residents. We’ve seen what happens when high-paid tech workers moved to Miami and Austin during the pandemic, dramatically raising prices for locals in various ways.”Samuels also says he expects such programs to see “diminishing returns” as more companies mandate in-person attendance.Some worker incentive programs have, in fact, ended altogether, such as the Life Works Here program – launched November 2020 – that attracted remote tech workers to northwest Arkansas with $10,000 and a free bike. And after five years, Vermont wrapped up its relocation incentive program in 2023, which had initially been paying up to $10,000 to qualified workers.However, there are still plenty of active programs accepting applications, some with generous offers and plenty of extra perks. Here, a few to consider if you’re looking to make a move of your own – and get paid in the process.When it launched in 2018, Tulsa Remote became the first program of its kind by offering remote workers and entrepreneurs $10,000 to move to the south-central US city for a year.Since then, some 2,900 people have been accepted into the program, and as of December 2022, its members had generated nearly $307 million in direct employment income, according to the most recent Tulsa Remote economic impact report. In addition, the program also generated an estimated new sales tax revenue of $2.5 million for Tulsa County and $3.1 million for the state of Oklahoma. “We have also seen a strong multiplier effect of friends and family joining members in Tulsa, with the city gaining three residents for every two Tulsa Remote program participants,” Justin Harlan, managing director of Tulsa Remote, told CNN Travel via email.Applications are currently open for the next round of Tulsa transplants, and the program aims to be 4,000-members-strong by 2027, according to Harlan. Applicants must be at least 18 years of age, have lived outside of Oklahoma for at least a year prior to applying, and relocate to Tulsa within 12 months of approval.With five participating communities, Ascend West Virginia is a public-private initiative with an impressive pedigree: Its founders are West Virginia native Brad D. Smith, former CEO of software company Intuit, and his wife Alys.Now in its third year, the program provides eligible recipients, sometimes known as Ascenders, with a $12,000 cash incentive ($10,000 the first year, an additional $2,000 the second), as well as outdoorsy perks like free passes for rock climbing, ziplining and golf to explore West Virginia’s rugged landscapes, as well as access to free co-working spaces. The full relocation package is valued at more than $20,000, and to date, more than 42,500 applications have been received, according to a spokesperson.Applicants can choose from a diverse range of Ascend communities, from the small mountain town vibes of the Greenbrier Valley to outdoor adventure galore in the country’s newest national park, New River Gorge – which also is the most recent community to the program – with an impressive 96.5% retention rate across the program. In addition, organizers have submitted a funding request to the state legislature to expand the program – so there could be even more participating communities in the future.Indiana has been one of the most ambitious states when it comes to enticing a new wave of workers with financial relocation packages and perks. Dozens of cities and regions have an incentive package in place, according to MakeMyMove, and as of 2023, some 340 households have relocated to Indiana through the platform.Hopeful Hoosiers have plenty to choose from for their new home. A package valued at $15,000 in Noblesville, a suburb of Indianapolis, includes a $5,000 relocation grant, a season of free golf at two courses, and coffee with the mayor. In Evansville, meanwhile, qualified applicants can take advantage of a $7,200 incentive that includes $5,000 in cash, museum passes and a one-year membership to the oldest urban old-growth forest in the US.Choose Topeka began in 2019, offering applicants up to $15,000 in incentives via employer match funding. Since then, more than 6,000 people have applied, with nearly 150 lucky newcomers chosen to move to the Sunflower State.Unlike some incentive programs, Choose Topeka doesn’t just focus on remote workers. Transitioning veterans, people who have recently left military service, and “Boomerangs” – former residents of the Topeka area looking to return to Shawnee County – are all eligible for $5,000 in direct incentives if they accept a job offer in Topeka with a minimum salary of $50,000.Recipients are required to remain for at least a year. But an impressive 95% of them stay for the long term, according to Robert Ross, senior vice president of marketing and communications with GO Topeka, the economic development agency in Shawnee County that administers the program.“People love how accessible and friendly our community is,” Ross told CNN Travel via email. “With around 175,000 residents in Topeka, the city is very easy to navigate and recipients quickly learn that ‘Midwest nice’ is a way of life here.”If you’re considering a move to the Bluegrass State, you have plenty of places to pick from: According to MakeMyMove, there are eight cities and towns currently recruiting for new workers.The $8,800 package to relocate to Mayfield and Graves County includes $5,000 cash, as well as plenty of other perks (50% off after-school childcare, lunch with the mayor, and a free monthly delivery of eggs, just to name a few). Several cities also include a $2,500 bonus on top of $5,000 cash for workers who bring a spouse who will work locally in healthcare or education.Craving a dose of Southern hospitality for your next life chapter? In an area known as the Shoals, which spans four main cities and two counties across Alabama’s northwestern region, a program called Remote Shoals offers qualified workers up to $10,000.The program launched in June 2019 and received its fourth round of funding in 2022 for a total of $1 million in investment. As of February 2022, it had received 2,300 applications from all 50 states, as well as several from abroad, with participants coming from 22 different states.Eligible applicants must be self-employed or a full-time remote employee outside Colbert and Lauderdale counties, make $52,000 or more annually, and relocate to the Shoals area within six months of being selected.Remote workers who aren’t interested in taking a bite of the Big Apple can look to Rochester, whose Greater ROC Remote program offers $10,000 in grants and incentives (plus another $9,000 for home-buying grants).The program, which was modeled after Tulsa’s program and others, welcomed its first recipients in April 2022. The goal is to bring in about 600 participants (not including family members) over three years. To be eligible, applicants must live more than 300 miles from downtown Rochester or in any other state except New York, have a fully remote job, and be 18 years or older.Applicants who have interviewed also are eligible to visit Rochester in person, with expenses up to $500 (and $750 for a couple) reimbursable.The Last Frontier is the most sparsely populated state in the US, with the third-smallest population, hovering at around 700,000 for the last decade. But instead of dangling cash incentives to potential residents out of state, Alaska instead provides those already within its borders with a yearly sum from its Permanent Fund Dividend, or PFD.The amount is variable every year, depending on what the government provides. But in 2022, every resident received $3,284 – the highest amount so far under the program. However, in 2023 and 2024 that figure dropped to $1,312.To be eligible for the PFD, you must live in Alaska for a whole calendar year before applying. In addition, you should plan to remain there indefinitely. Other qualifying criteria also apply. Applications are open between January 1 and March 31.Prospective college students or recent grads in the Great Lakes State, this one’s for you: Approximately 350 scholarships and internships are up for grabs in The Michigander Scholars program, which is designed to attract talent for the state’s burgeoning electric vehicle, mobility and semiconductor industries.The year-old program awards scholarships ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 to qualifying recipients who complete an internship and/or accept a full-time position in industries including computing, electronics, software development, or process engineering. There are some stipulations, of course: The job or internship must come through a participating company, and recipients must commit to staying in Michigan for at least 12 months.In addition, the program is “curated,” explains Kerry Ebersole Singh, chief talent solutions and engagement officer at Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which runs the program. After being selected to join a “cohort” of qualified candidates, “then they are brought into special opportunities to do meet and greets with employers that then lead to either an internship opportunity and or a job opportunity.”So far, the program has awarded 62 scholarships, with 521 students currently participating in the cohort. The current initial phase will award up to 350 scholarships, but Ebersole Singh says the program is growing.“We’re only looking at ways to strategically expand the program, whether that is opening up more opportunities through our employers and these scholarships for out-of-state students or out-of-state schools or … directly tying this to homeownership and other [incentives],” she tells CNN. “So, I definitely foresee us looking at how to grow this in strategic areas versus winding it down at this point.”"

        "title": "Dubai wants to build the biggest airport in the world. Here’s how that’s going",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "A little more than 10 years ago, in October 2013, a Wizz Air A320 arriving from Budapest made headlines by becoming the first commercial passenger flight ever to touch down at Al Maktoum International Airport, also known as Dubai World Central (DWC).This brand new “greenfield” airport some 20 miles southwest of downtown Dubai was designed to become, in a not-so-distant future, the world’s largest and busiest. The vision was – and still is – for a futuristic mega-hub, ensuring that the emirate’s role as a major node of the global economy doesn’t run into capacity problems anytime soon.Dubai Airports, the airport authority that manages both Dubai International (DXB) and the new airport, promises that when Al Maktoum International is finished, it‘ll be able to handle more than 160 million passengers per year as well as 12 million tonnes of freight.To put that in perspective, that’s nearly 63 million more travelers than the world’s current busiest airport, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International, handled in 2022 and nearly 100 million more than Dubai International. DXB, let’s not forget, is already the world’s busiest airport outside of the US and Dubai’s main international gateway.However, a decade and a pandemic after that initial passenger flight, and a full 13 years since it first opened for cargo operations, Dubai’s newest airport is still very much a work in progress.DWC has found a role as a center for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul – “MRO” in industry parlance. It also hosts a number of air cargo operators (including Emirates Cargo, the freight subsidiary of the UAE flag carrier) and handles executive jets and some charter flights.Scheduled passenger services, however, are limited to those provided by a handful of low-cost carriers that operate services mostly to Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia.So what’s been happening with those ambitious plans? And when might we see a timeline or new designs?The recent Dubai Air Show, held at a purpose-built venue at Al Maktoum International Airport in 2023, offered some intriguing hints about what’s ahead for DWC – and some insights into Dubai Airports’ long-term strategy.“We have prioritized expansion and investments at DXB to meet our customers’ requirements and plans,” Paul Griffiths, Dubai Airports CEO, tells CNN. “This will continue until all possible capacity is absorbed.”The plan is to maximize current capacity through “the application of innovative technology and refurbishments to rethink the use of space,” says Griffiths, adding another 20 million passengers to DXB’s current annual capacity of 100 million passengers.“This expansion will not only accommodate near-term growth but also provide us with additional time to strategize for the phased expansion of DWC. Our passenger forecasts for 2023 stand at 86.8 million, with projections of 88.2 million and 93.8 million for 2024 and 2025, respectively,” he adds.Griffiths has been careful not to confirm a timeline, but in November 2023 he told the AFP news agency that when capacity is reached “we are going to need a new airport […] That is going to have to happen at some stage during the 2030s.”“DWC is a thrilling prospect,” Griffiths told CNN in January this year. “The future Phase 2 development represents a significant opportunity, allowing us to build from the ground up in alignment with Dubai’s broader goals and growth plans.”Griffiths told reporters at the air show that designs are already being produced for the new mega-airport, but the massive, three-dimensional scale model displayed at the event, with its six parallel runways and three gigantic terminals, is already some years outdated.However, Griffiths has hinted to Business Traveller magazine about an intriguing modular approach to gradually expand DWC on a timeline that might run into the 2050s. “We are not planning an airport that has terminals,” he said. “We’re going to completely change the business model for airports, make them actually far more intimate, and get rid of all the legacy processes that we’ve had to subject our customers to, for far too long.”The airport will be the centerpiece of a much larger scheme, called Dubai South, that envisages the creation of a whole new city in a 145-square-kilometer stretch of desert just south of Dubai.This entire new district, of which some pieces are already starting to take shape, will have eight neighborhoods each allocated to a specific industry or activity, with a mix of residential and commercial areas as well.With the airport at the heart of the action, it will form a complete “aerotropolis”. The Mohammed bin Rashid (MBR) Aerospace Hub, which will host Dubai’s burgeoning aviation and aerospace industrial ecosystem, including the recently announced $950 million Emirates engineering center, will be playing a very prominent role in this vision.The real turning point, however, will come the day local giant Emirates and its smaller partner, flyDubai, relocate to the new airport from their current home at Dubai International. This move has long been on the cards, but it has no known timeframe yet.According to Nadine Itani, program leader for air transport management at the University of Surrey in England, Emirates’ shift to DWC is more than a relocation.“It’s a strategic realignment in response to the changing dynamics of the global air travel and trade market,” says the aviation expert, who notes that Dubai’s bet on DWC as a future mega-hub is not an isolated move. There is currently a race in the region to invest in new, large-scale airport facilities and no one wants to lag behind.The region’s flag carriers are not only keen to claim their share of global travel flows and position their capital cities as international trade centers, but also, increasingly, to establish themselves as tourist destinations in their own right. Shiny new airports will support these efforts.“There has been a notable shift in the incoming traffic mix into Dubai with a decrease in connecting passengers and an increase in terminating passengers, coupled with the anticipated surge in transport and logistics activity due to Dubai’s role in the planned trade agreements such as the [India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor],” says Itani.Inaugurated as recently as 2014, Hamad International Airport in nearby Qatar, a direct competitor of Dubai in the long-haul connectivity market, is gearing to expand its capacity to more than 60 million annual passengers.This adds to other airport expansion projects in the region: the opening of a $1.8 billion brand new airport in Muscat, Oman, in 2018, the $1.1 billion new terminal in Bahrain in 2021 and, more recently, in November 2023, of Abu Dhabi’s grand new Terminal A, a 780,000-square-meter facility able to handle up to 79 aircraft simultaneously.At the northern end of the Gulf, Kuwait International Airport is building a new terminal designed by renowned British architectural firm Foster+Partners, which will have the capacity to handle 25 million passengers per year initially, with the possibility of doubling it up to 50 million in the future.And less than 20 miles from Dubai’s downtown, Sharjah International Airport, which is primarily home to low-cost carrier Air Arabia, is also increasing its capacity to 20 million passengers annually.Saudi Arabia is also readying a massive airport expansion as part of its 2030 Vision, which has allocated $100 billion to prop up the kingdom’s air connectivity and turn it into one of the world’s top tourist destinations.In addition to a new international airline, Riyadh Air, the Saudi capital is also getting a gigantic new airport. Riyadh’s new six-runway airport will, in fact, be built at the same location as the current one, fully replacing it. It will have capacity for 185 million passengers per year, or almost seven times the number it handled in 2022.When it comes to claiming the top spot in the global airport league tables, the stakes are higher than ever."

        "title": "Patmos: The Greek island where the end of the world began",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "The island of Patmos, sitting under perfect blue skies in the eastern reaches of the Aegean sea, may look like a typical vacation destination in Greece, but it isn’t.It’s where the end of the world began.Not that you’d guess that, strolling down the winding path in the center of the island, where a sleepy priest tends a souvenir stall.Yet, this is the place from where infernal visions of mankind’s ultimate downfall sprang – inspiring St. John to write the Book of Revelation which forms the closing pages of the New Testament and gives the Bible some of its most portentous descriptions.Here, the Greek Orthodox chapel of St. Anne, constructed in the early 17th century, completely encloses the cave where John is said to have seen visions that he interpreted as the final judgment.lf it wasn’t for the sign reading “Cave of the Apocalypse” you wouldn’t know you were entering the sacred grotto. The chapel, it’s north side sealed by a rocky alcove, lies at the end of a series of corridors.Inside, a silver miter rises over a fenced-off cleft where the biblical figure apparently laid his head to rest. A silver bracket surrounds the crack where he’s said to have placed his hands to get up.“This is where Prochorus the scribe took down John’s reams of words as the saint was having the vision,” the chapel’s warden says, pointing to an open Bible sitting where the rock forms a natural pedestal.“And this is where God’s voice came through and spoke to the saint,” he adds, pointing to a fissure on the rock above.The fissure ends in a triple point, considered to symbolize Christianity’s holy trinity – the father, son and holy ghost.Two monks still live in cells above the cave today, but the main focus of religious activity in Patmos – known as the “sacred island” – is the monastery of St. John, an imposing citadel that looms over the island.Established in 1088 by St. Christodoulos, a Greek monk, the monastery still contains original structures dating to the 11th century – parts of the fortifications, the kitchen, some cells, the cistern and, most importantly, the church of St. John, which boasts some superb frescoes.While the church is impressive, the monastery’s museum and library are several notches more formidable.The original “golden bull” by Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos has pride of place. This ancient seal granted the whole island to Christodoulos, with imperial monograms appearing all over the scroll in the way we initial contract pages nowadays.There’s also a firman – a type of edict – issued by Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror from 1454 that confirms the monastery’s independence and assigning a monk as a tax collector.The library – said to be the most important in Greece outside the Greek Orthodox center of Mount Athos – boasts 1,200 manuscripts in parchment, vellum or scrolls, including leaves of Mark’s gospel dating from the 6th century.Although the cave and the monastery are the principal attractions on Patmos, they’re not the only reason people flock to the island according to Panagos Evgenikos, leader of the island’s council.“Some years ago we joined a European conference on religious tourism along with places like Santiago de Compostela in Spain and Lourdes in France,” Evgenikos said during this writer’s visit in 2018. “The final consensus was that religion by itself is not enough to attract tourists to a destination; there must be an extra pulling factor.“In the case of Patmos, it’s our beaches and the beauty of Chora, our capital.”A swim at Lambi in the north of Patmos helped prove Evgenikos’ words.The beach here is dotted with small, multi-colored pebbles ranging from butterscotch orange to sweet potato red and egg yolk yellow – and the combined effect is extraordinary.Then there’s Petra, a sandy spit of land joined to the free-standing rock of Kallikatsou – according to legend the rock is formed of a young girl whose mother out put a curse on her after she swam here straight after Holy Communion, despite being forbidden to do so.Another highlight is the lovely fishing village of Grikos, facing the small island of Tragonissi, a natural windbreaker to a safe, sandy beach.Located in the north of Greece’s Dodecanese island group, Patmos has no airport and it’s not easy to reach, but it attracts VIPs from all over the world due to its tranquility – the Aga Khan, David Bowie and Giorgio Armani have all been regulars over the years.In fact, several have made Patmos their home and sought to benefit the island.Nicholas Negroponte from MIT’s Media Lab installed an island-wide Wi-Fi system for everyone to surf the internet for free.Another Patmos lover, the financier Charles Pictet, restored three windmills on a hill opposite the monastery. One is fully functional and produces wholemeal flour.Josef Zisyadis, a Swiss politician, harbored more ambitious plans – in he began cultivating vines in 20 acres of land near Petra beach with Dorian Amar, a French winemaker.Back in 2018, Amar was proudly showing off an Assyrtiko white and a Mavrothiriko red under the cheeky label of “Domaine de l’Apocalypse.”“The soil is fertile, there’s water in the ground, but the terroir is not perfect for the vines,” he said at the time. “There’s wind and there’s sun but there’s no shade.”“I’ve been planting trees to lower the temperature and improve the production – an oak here, a few carob trees there – give me a few years and I’ll have turned this patch into a paradise.”Many would argue that the island is already a paradise because of its relative inaccessibility, but is the building of an airport on the cards?Christos Patakos, manager of Patmos Aktis, the only five-star hotel on the island, shook his head.“I don’t think it’ll ever happen,” he said, when asked in 2018. “There’s a general feeling, especially among the regulars and those who own houses on Patmos, that the island must be ‘protected’ from mass tourism. It is they who object.”While the monastery is one of the main draws here, it doesn’t dominate life on the island.“The monastery has a lot of clout, but it keeps out of everyday life as long as there’s mutual respect: for instance, there’s no nudism and Chora’s bars shut at 3 a.m.”Father Bartholomew, a jovial, communicative monk, agreed.“That’s when we go to Matins,” he interjected. “Tourists forget that this is a living monastery and that we must fulfill our obligations.”Bartholomew also conceded that the monastery would welcome an airport on island.“It would only marginally increase tourism and be beneficial for the locals in medical emergencies.According to Bartholomew, the monastery has always sided with the municipality and the tourist authorities when it comes to development plans.“An army base here wanted to have artillery exercises during the summer; we forbade them,” he added.“As for the opening hours: we close at 1:30 p.m. because we hold Vespers at 3 p.m. We wake up for Matins at 3 a.m. with Mass at 6 a.m. so that we can open at 8 a.m.“Even by mid-June some shops may not have opened yet, but we’re the only reliable operation on the island, open all year round.“It’s all balanced and harmonious; we all know where we stand.”Patakos agreed. “The island has many fans, who come here to recharge their batteries and absorb its energy You can feel the vibes when you arrive.“Yes, tourism is mainly beach tourism – but we’re lucky to also have great sights like the monastery and the cave.”“Patmos is a tiny Byzantium, like Mount Athos but more advanced – they don’t call it ‘the Jerusalem of the Aegean’ without reason.”Getting thereThe easiest way to go to Patmos is via ferry (two to three hours) from Kos, which has an international airport.Patmos Aktis Suites & Spa, Patmos 855 00; +30 2247 032800Monastery of St. John the Theologian, Patmos 855 00; +30 2247 031223"

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Mount Fuji, a UNESCO World Heritage site and an icon of Japan, is putting new regulations in place for climbers amid concerns about overcrowding.Human traffic jams, foothills littered with garbage and inappropriately attired hikers – some attempting the ascent in sandals - are among the issues plaguing the popular Japanese site.To ease congestion on the mountain, the Yamanashi prefectural government, which manages Fuji, voted this week to charge 2,000 yen ($13) per climber going forward.“By strongly promoting comprehensive safety measures for climbing Mount Fuji, we will ensure that Mount Fuji, a treasure of the world, is passed on to future generations,” said Koutaro Nagasaki, governor of Yamanashi Prefecture.“In order to revive traditional mountain climbing from the foot of Mount Fuji, we will gain a detailed understanding of the Fuji-ko and Oshi culture that supported Mount Fuji worship. We look to link these cultures to this mountain climbing, as it is rooted in the cultural values of the religion.”Fuji-ko is a religion specific to the mountain.Toshiaki Kasai, from Yamanashi Prefecture’s World Heritage Fuji Division, told CNN that the local prefecture will also impose a daily limit of 4,000 climbers.In addition, there will be new guides who manage safety on and around the trails. They will inform climbers when they’re violating etiquette on the mountain, such as sleeping by the side of the trail, starting a fire or wearing the wrong clothing.While Kasai did not use the term “overtourism,” in recent years it has become clear that too many pairs of feet are causing issues on the 3,776-meter (12,388-foot) mountain.According to prefectural data, five million people hiked Mount Fuji in 2019, a rise of three million from 2012.“Overtourism – and all the subsequent consequences like rubbish, rising CO2 emissions and reckless hikers – is the biggest problem facing Mount Fuji,” Masatake Izumi, a Yamanashi prefectural government official, told CNN Travel last year.In 2023, a volunteer named Tomoyo Takahashi told CNN she would ask visitors to voluntarily contribute 1,000 yen ($7.50) toward maintaining the mountain.“Not everyone pays the 1,000 yen, and it makes me sad. There should be a mandatory entrance fee that’s much much higher so only visitors who truly appreciate Mount Fuji’s heritage come,” she said at the time.Now, Takahashi will get her wish.Overtourism has become a bigger issue in Japan since the country reopened following the pandemic.In Kyoto, locals in the historic Gion quarter have expressed their concern with tourists who flock there to photograph and sometimes harass the geisha who live and work there, earning the nickname “geisha paparazzi.”While the city has put up signs and placards asking visitors not to photograph geisha, some locals told CNN Travel that it wasn’t enough. One suggestion offered by the neighborhood council is issuing fines or tickets.And the town of Hatsukaichi, in Hiroshima prefecture in southwestern Japan, has been affected too. The small town is home to the famous orange “floating shrine” torii gate, which is part of a 1,400-year-old Shinto complex.In October 2023, the town began charging 100 yen (33 cents) per visitor to the shrine. The money from the “tourist tax” goes toward maintaining the site and its infrastructure."

        "title": "He booked a one-way ticket to Thailand the day after finishing high school. Now he’s a top Bangkok chef",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Nilas Corneliussen doesn’t need much sleep. In fact, the 32-year-old finds it unsettling when a city turns quiet at night.“I’m both a night and morning person,” says the Swedish-born executive head chef of Nordic-Asian fusion restaurant Villa Frantzen, one of only two Nordic restaurants in Thailand’s capital.“I much prefer to be in a dynamic city that never sleeps, and Bangkok gives me that.”But while Thailand had long appealed to him, even in his youth, Corneliussen says he never imagined a career in cooking.Instead, he was drawn to Muay Thai, or Thai boxing, the striking art known for beautiful sequences of powerful punches, ax-like knees and elbows followed by lightning-fast kicks.It was that instant confirmation of being better than his opponent that absorbed him; that immediate result based on ability and skill. On high school breaks, he even traveled solo to Thailand to join Muay Thai training camps.“During those trips, I fell in love with the country,” Corneliussen tells CNN Travel.But that frisson of excitement – it wasn’t to be. After sustaining a hand injury while boxing, he was forced to move on from Muay Thai. However he didn’t stop thinking about Thailand.The very day after graduating from high school in Sweden, Corneliussen booked a one-way ticket to Bangkok and applied for a study visa.“That’s how I ended up studying economics, because I needed a way to get a visa to be able to stay,” he grins mischievously.It wasn’t until halfway through his studies, from 2010-2014, that he was inspired by a fellow student and friend who “ran local Thai eateries, nothing fancy.”Still, there was something inside of him that was drawn to the experience.“The atmosphere inside the kitchen fascinated me – everyone has to come together to make it happen,” Corneliussen recalls.At the time, the chef didn’t think he could pursue his new passion for cooking in Thailand. Instead, he thought it would be best to go back to his roots and understand the flavors he’d grown up with before cooking anything else, so he finished his studies and moved back to Europe.It’s a view he doesn’t agree with today.“No cooking style is more important than another,” says Corneliussen.“The broad spectrum you gain from exploring cuisines from all over the world is what lends every chef a unique skill set and better fundament for creation. That’s why, after working in different kitchens, I became interested in Asian cuisines.”Starting out in a Stockholm trattoria, he honed his skills and earned a place in Michelin-starred restaurant Noma in Copenhagen – voted world’s best restaurant for several years. In 2019, he won the silver in the Bocuse d’Or, the world’s most prestigious international cooking competition, as part of the Swedish team.Despite those successes, he knew he wanted to return to Asia to pursue his passion for culinary arts.In 2022, Corneliussen made the move to the Villa Frantzen, which opened that same year, where he showcases casual Nordic food with Asian influences in a series of set menus.“In Thailand, I get this feeling of belonging and connection to the people, food and culture,” he says, recalling his first days as an expat in the Thai Kingdom.“It was just amazing. It was like living in paradise every day. I hate cold weather!”Part of the Frantzen Group, a restaurant empire owned by famed chef and former footballer Björn Frantzen, Villa Frantzen is located in Bangkok’s Sathorn Road area.The oak-scented Nordic-style villa, with its open kitchen, is surrounded by the garden’s bubbling mini-waterfalls and snuggled against a giant Jamjuree tree, evoking a sense of warmth and nostalgia. It also sparks Corneliussen’s creativity.Engaging in a labor of love, the former Thai boxer cooks dishes thick in consistency, like the amber, richly flavorful beef consommé and creamy foie gras wontons, which taste like venison-flavored butter with hints of liver.And while people have slurped oysters directly out of their shells before, the Nordic-Asian version, spiced up with a pumpkin condiment, might be alien to their tongues. What’s special about this juicy oyster with smoked cream and nutty sea buckthorn oil is that it’s cooked at 63.4 degrees Celsius for an hour.“If I find something that I like, I can spend days on that,” says Corneliussen of his creative process.“And I can go a long time with few hours of sleep a night. I don’t know what it is. I go to bed late, wake up, and feel fresh.”Even when he’s off work, he doesn’t spend time in bed; he goes out exploring Bangkok.“I’m an introverted extrovert; very outgoing and social with people I know and like,” says the chef.“In larger groups, I refrain from stealing the spotlight. But in the kitchen, I have to be more commanding.”As for the future of Bangkok’s restaurant scene?“It’ll be booming even more,” says Corneliussen when asked what to expect in the next five years.“There’s a lot of big names coming in, and young chefs are opening their eateries … I think you have to be sharp and relevant, and that pushes restaurants.”It’s now been more than a decade since Corneliussen first set his sights on Bangkok, and he acknowledges that his career path was unusual – and anything but easy.“Taking the leap from studying economics to entering the kitchen was risky and demanding,” he says.“Instead of a joyful youth, the last 10 years have been filled with hard work and dedication to hone my culinary skills.”But it certainly panned out – particularly given his feelings for cold weather.“It’s a blessing to have summer every day,” he laughs.Villa Frantzén – Restaurant & Bar, 7 Soi Yen Akat 3, Chong Nonsi, Bangkok; +66 (0)87 344 8222."

        "text": "It rains an average of 171 days per year in Singapore. But one hotel in the Lion City is taking a gamble to ensure that rain doesn’t spoil its guests’ holidays.The InterContinental Singapore’s “Rain Resist Bliss” package will reimburse one night of a guest’s stay if one of their planned activities ends up getting rained out.“​​I was chatting with a group of friends about what’s next in luxury travel and one of them jokingly commented that being able to guarantee good weather would be the next level of ultimate luxury travel,” the hotel’s general manager, Andreas Kraemer, tells CNN. From there, the concept of a rain insurance package was born.Still, there are caveats. The InterContinental isn’t going to hand out cash every single time it rains. According to a release from the hotel, ​​the criteria is met when “rain duration exceeds 120 cumulative minutes within any 4-hour block of time during daylight hours.”The package also is only applicable to people staying in suites, which begin at 850 SGD ($633) a night for junior suites and start at 4,500 SGD ($3,349) for the presidential suite.The money comes in the form of a voucher, which must be spent at the InterContinental Singapore within six months, and the amount you get is equivalent to one night’s stay in your room category.Kraemer’s own personal rainy day favorite things to do in Singapore include visiting the Asian Civilizations Museum, taking a tour of Tiger Brewery and shopping at the local outpost of Japanese bookstore Kinokuniya.Special packages like these can be a way for an established hotel to stand out from the pack.In Bali, one hotel banned smartphones and other electronics by the pool as a way to encourage guests to unplug and relax.Meanwhile, several hotels and resorts around the world, including the Park Hyatt New York, have created special rooms designed for getting an optimal night’s sleep, complete with white noise machines, weighted blankets and special sleepytime teas."

        "title": "He thought the guy he met on vacation was just a fling. He turned out to be the love of his life",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Guillermo Barrantes relationship with Larry Mock was supposed to begin and end in Palm Springs.It was a “casual, brief encounter.” A vacation dalliance that only lasted half a day.“It was just so casual, so easily nothing could have happened from it,” Guillermo tells CNN Travel. “We could have walked away and just had our lives separate. But of course that didn’t happen, because it wasn’t meant to be that way. It was meant to be the way that it was. That it is.”It all started in summer 2013. Guillermo - then in his early 40s - was on vacation in the California resort city of Palm Springs. He was in a phase of life where, he says, he was prioritizing himself, and wasn’t interested in long term romance.“I thrived in being by myself, in traveling by myself, in having dinner by myself – I loved all of that so much,” says Guillermo, who lived in Boston, Massachusetts at the time.“I wanted no commitment, I wanted no emotional entanglement of any kind. I wanted to have fun, get to know myself. And it was in that mode that I met Larry, when I wasn’t really looking.”During the vacation in Palm Springs, Guillermo was staying at a friend’s apartment, and while the friend worked during the day, Guillermo passed his time at a “run-down, no-frills” resort a couple of blocks away.“You could just pay for a day pass, they’d give you a towel, and you could be in the pool and use their bar,” he recalls.One day, as he was walking the palm tree-lined streets to the resort, Guillermo swiped right on a guy on a dating app – Larry Mock, mid-40s, friendly smile. The two men exchanged a few messages back and forth. Larry said he was also on vacation in Palm Springs, staying in the resort Guillermo kept frequenting.They arranged to meet there for a drink by the pool. Guillermo was looking forward to meeting Larry, expecting “some casual fun.”Then, when Guillermo and Larry met, there was “chemistry” right away. Guillermo calls their connection “magnetic.”“My impression of Larry: sexy, handsome and warm,” he recalls.Larry was a Texas-based American Airlines flight attendant who’d booked the vacation to Palm Springs at the last minute. He’d recently broken up with a long-term partner but due to lease and budget reasons the two were still living together – awkwardly – in Dallas, Texas.Larry’s workdays were spent traveling the world. But during his downtime, he struggled to relax in the apartment with his ex, and this sentiment motivated the spontaneous vacation.“I needed to get out of town for the weekend, because we were just butting heads badly at that time,” Larry tells CNN Travel today.Larry searched his airline’s database, looking at destinations he could visit using the last minute, standby flight tickets available for flight attendants.“Palm Springs had seats, so I booked my standby flight, got to Palm Springs, checked into this resort. And that’s where Guillermo came into the picture,” says Larry.Larry was instantly attracted to Guillermo. He thought he was “just the most handsome guy” he’d ever seen.And as they got chatting, and Guillermo kept making Larry laugh, Larry sketched out his first impression to include two more adjectives: “so funny, and so kind.”In passing, as the two flirted over pool-side cocktails, Larry mentioned that he was a flight attendant.Guillermo lit up. In fact, his response was “giddy,” as Larry recalls it.“He started asking me tons of questions about planes, and flight attendants, and the routes and all of that kind of stuff.”“I’m a huge aviation geek,” explains Guillermo. As a kid growing up in Costa Rica, he’d wanted to be a pilot. Instead, he ended up working as an IT consultant. And while he says he was good at that job, liked it well enough and made good money – he still dreamed about working in aviation. Meeting a flight attendant was fascinating.“I was immediately drawn to his career,” says Guillermo.Larry found Guillermo’s enthusiasm for aviation charming, and happily answered his questions.Later that evening, Larry and Guillermo said their goodbyes, with no plans to meet again.“I was glad to meet him,” says Larry. “But I was like, ‘There’s no way I am going to pursue dating somebody that lived in Boston.’ And I still was dealing with what I was dealing with in Dallas.”“We just really enjoyed the time that we had together,” says Guillermo. “But we went our separate ways.”Almost without realizing – and certainly without intending to – Guillermo and Larry stayed in touch.“We kept chatting, we kept texting,” says Guillermo.Then, a few days after meeting Larry, Guillermo got an unexpected phone call from his mother in Costa Rica. He was still in Palm Springs at the time.“She said, ‘I don’t want you to freak out, but I just got diagnosed with breast cancer. I don’t want you to change the trip.’”Guillermo tried to protest, but his mother insisted he should enjoy the rest of his vacation. She reassured him that her sisters and Guillermo’s father were taking care of her, and she’d see Guillermo later in the month – he already had a trip to Costa Rica scheduled for that summer.Not wanting to go against his mother’s wishes, Guillermo stayed put in the desert. He tried to “compartmentalize” the news, but he was really close to his mom, and it was cataclysmic.Later, back home in Boston, Guillermo found himself sharing his mother’s news with Larry, and confiding in him about his fears and worries. He added that his mother lived in Costa Rica, so he’d likely be flying back and forth for the rest of the year.Larry was supportive, empathetic – and he told Guillermo that he should use the discounted flights Larry got through work.Guillermo was taken aback – it was “such a sweet gesture” from someone who was basically a stranger. But then, somehow, Larry already felt much more than that.“Very early on, he and I had just beautiful interactions, and it revealed the kind of person that he was,” he says.And so, rather than dwindling, Larry and Guillermo’s communication increased as the days rolled on.“Within just a few weeks, we just knew – without much discussion, without talking about it – we just knew that there was a very, very strong connection there,” says Guillermo.“We always had something to talk about,” says Larry.Larry was still hesitant about jumping into something new, following the breakdown of his previous relationship. But the messages back and forth with Guillermo became a highlight of his day. And as time passed, he found himself opening up to Guillermo, confiding in him.“After a few months, I was like, ‘Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for my whole life. Someone that I can be my authentic self with,’” says Larry.In September 2013, two months after their Palm Springs meeting, Larry arranged to visit Guillermo in Boston.At Logan Airport, Larry came down the escalator and spotted Guillermo’s face in the crowd. He was beaming, and started running towards Larry.Then, Guillermo “hugged me so hard,” recalls Larry.He remembers thinking, “Oh my god, this is the one.”Then Guillermo and Larry went to Boston’s seaport district together, and found a sundrenched rooftop bar where they sat drinking beers.“We could see the planes approaching Logan, and it was just a sunny and perfect Boston day,” recalls Guillermo. “I remember that, like a picture, sitting by the edge – I remember the beer and I remember the planes.”It was “magical,” says Guillermo, but also slightly “surreal.”The Palm Springs encounter was so brief. He never thought he’d see Larry again. And now here Larry was, sitting opposite him, in Guillermo’s city.From there, Guillermo and Larry started dating cross-country.They took advantage of Larry’s discounted flights. Sometimes Larry traveled to Boston, but usually Guillermo visited Larry in Dallas. Guillermo’s love of flying meant that, for him, the four-hour journey across the country was part of the fun.“I was in heaven,” he says. “Just the fact that I was getting to do something that I have always just loved - which is being on an airplane and going somewhere.”Each Friday, as he packed his bag and headed to the airport, Guillermo would also be struck with “excitement” at the thought of seeing Larry.And during these weekend visits, Guillermo and Larry grew accustomed to each other’s habits, how they moved through their days, how they liked to spend their time. Guillermo got to know Larry’s friends and got to know Dallas as a city. They spoke about their hopes, dreams, ambitions and families.Guillermo says it was obvious that they were “very aligned on the important aspects of life: how we view finances, closeness with families, politically and world views and enjoyment of the small things in life.”Larry supported Guillermo as he cared for his mother through her cancer, and celebrated with him when she recovered.“For us, it was a gradual process of falling in love,” says Guillermo. “But a theme for us in our life together is that everything felt right and natural.”“We can’t pinpoint the moment, but we simply knew very deep in our hearts that we found the life partner.”“That made me so happy,” says Larry.For Guillermo, moving to Dallas two years later, in late 2015, was “just as the easiest decision.”Larry was thrilled. His Dallas-based friendship group had already welcomed Guillermo into the fold, and his parents were happy for him too.“I introduced Guillermo to everybody,” says Larry. “My family’s always been very accepting of me.”Guillermo’s family situation was more complicated. He’s always been very close with his parents and siblings, but for the first two decades of his adult life, he didn’t talk to his family about relationships.“My personal life was not necessarily an open book,” Guillermo says. “Love has never been the question - my parents love me, I love my parents and my sisters, we all get along great. But there was always that invisible barrier, which was: I don’t talk about my personal relationships.”But Guillermo didn’t want to hide Larry from anyone - he felt he owed that to himself, and to Larry.“I wasn’t going to edit myself, I wasn’t going to filter. I just knew deep in my heart that it was my chance to be able to truly be myself,” he says.So Guillermo started peppering his phone calls home with mentions of Larry. He uploaded cute photos of the two of them to social media.“I’m fearless,” he told himself. “Nothing bad can happen here.”Cut to 2018, which was a monumental year for Guillermo and Larry for a couple of reasons. For one, it was the year Guillermo followed in Larry’s footsteps and became a flight attendant.It was a mutual friend who suggested Guillermo should give it a shot, and Larry – who’d spent years listening to Guillermo wax lyrical about airplanes – was wholeheartedly encouraging.Guillermo applied to Larry’s airline, American Airlines, but wasn’t accepted. But then he applied to Delta, and was accepted on the spot.While Guillermo and Larry loved the idea of working together, flying with different airlines also “worked out great,” says Guillermo. For one, there were two different sets of airline benefits to enjoy.And working in the air was everything Guillermo hoped it would be and more.“I was doing my dream job, my childhood dream job,” he says. “I still have to pinch myself that actually, I am a flight attendant.”2018 was also the year Guillermo and Larry got married.Guillermo proposed to Larry on an airplane. The couple were flying back to Dallas after visiting San Francisco, where they’d attended an Adele concert. As they were descending, the Dallas lights glistening out the airplane window, Guillermo suddenly felt the time was right. He turned to Larry and asked him to marry him. Larry smiled, and said yes.“Despite it being impromptu, as an aviation geek, I love that I proposed on a flight,” says Guillermo.The couple started planning their nuptials. Guillermo was excited, but he was unsure what role – if any – his family would play on the wedding day. While Guillermo had mentioned Larry to his parents, they still hadn’t met him. This was partly because Guillermo’s family were in Costa Rica, and partly because Guillermo wasn’t sure how that meeting would play out.“The person that I had the most trouble with was my father – because he was the one that had the hardest time really accepting me,” says Guillermo.As plans for the wedding started to take shape, Guillermo composed a long email to his father.“I said something to the effect of, ‘Hey Dad, I know I really haven’t really talked much about any of my personal life. But I met this person, Larry, who is the love of my life. We are going to get married. Come, don’t come, no problem. But I just need to tell you because this is probably one of the most important days and times of my life.’”Guillermo’s father didn’t attend the wedding. “For those reasons and also because he was towards the end of his life, his mobility was a problem,” Guillermo says.“But my mom, my sisters, my niece and my nephew came, which was far more than I ever imagined or dreamed. That was such a great moment.”Guillermo introduced his mother and sisters to Larry a couple of days before the wedding. They all gathered at a rooftop bar in Dallas, along with Guillermo and Larry’s close friends.When Guillermo’s mother saw Larry for the first time, she enveloped Larry in her arms. The two hit it off right away. Guillermo was overwhelmed with happiness.“For me, to see Larry and mom interact – they just love each other so much,” says Guillermo. “And my sisters just cannot get enough of him – I just sit back, and just enjoy.”Guillermo and Larry’s wedding took place at the Dallas Arboretum, a botanical garden.It was an outdoor wedding, and the couple woke up to the rain pouring and concerned texts from guests worried how the wedding would play out in a downpour.“But then, sure enough, out came the sun at the right time,” recalls Guillermo.Larry and Guillermo wrote their own vows and read them to each other during the ceremony. Guillermo told Larry that he inspired him to be a better son, sibling, friend and person.“You want a partner that is going to challenge you to be better,” says Guillermo. “I always feel that I want to be a better human being just in general, because he is such a figure in my life and everyone’s life – he is the center of everybody’s life.”In turn, Larry promised Guillermo their married life would be “exciting, adventurous and full of passion.”“I’m proud to take you as my husband. I promise to fly with you to the ends of the earth,” Larry said. “I can’t wait to grow old together and look back at this beautiful moment.”He ended the vows telling Guillermo: “Te amo” – Spanish for “I love you.”The reception was held at a local winery. During the celebrations, Guillermo and Larry danced to Rihanna’s hit “We Found Love,” which includes the lyric: “We found love in a hopeless place.”The couple felt it was fitting – the resort they met at did seem a bit of a “hopeless place.” And they never expected that brief meeting would lead to a lasting love.“We made sure that song was played, because we did find love in a hopeless place,” says Larry.“And I love Rihanna, too,” says Guillermo.At one point, Guillermo and Larry walked through the reception doors holding hands, spontaneously lifting their arms in the air, a “victorious” pose, as Guillermo put it.“It was just an electric effect,” he says.A few years into their marriage, Guillermo and Larry visited Costa Rica together for the first time. Larry was excited to see Guillermo’s home country, and Guillermo was excited to show his husband where he grew up – and the visit was also an opportunity for Larry to finally meet Guillermo’s father.Guillermo was nervous about how the meeting would play out, but when he arrived at his parents’ house with Larry in tow, Guillermo’s father opened his arms and hugged Larry tightly.“He said, ‘Welcome home,’” says Guillermo.It was a cathartic, emotional moment for everyone.“I was so nervous that day, meeting the father-in-law,” says Larry. “And when he just said ‘welcome home,’ and hugged me, every bit of nerves went away. I felt comfortable, I felt welcomed, I felt loved.”Larry says the moment felt like the “last piece” of a puzzle slotting into place. Guillermo was overjoyed.“That evening, which we got to spend – me, mom, dad, and Larry – was just a highlight,” says Guillermo.The family played old records on a turntable. Guillermo and his mother danced in the living room, while Larry and Guillermo’s father sipped cocktails and watched, laughing.“I had to just step back, because you have to look at those moments and just kind of create a little mini movie of them,” says Guillermo.Guillermo’s father has since passed away, which makes Guillermo and Larry all the more grateful for that time together in Costa Rica.In general, a feeling of gratitude defines Guillermo and Larry’s relationship – gratitude for each other and what they’ve brought to one another’s lives, and gratitude that their paths crossed over ten years ago.On their anniversary, the couple usually return to Palm Springs to celebrate the day they met.“Not only is Palm Springs beautiful with a great vibe, but we love to go back and celebrate our meeting place,” says Larry. “We weren’t looking, neither one of us – but it did happen, and it’s definitely for life.”“What a gift,” says Guillermo, who says his life today is what he dreamed of “as a little gay boy in Costa Rica, always loving the US, always loving airplanes, always envisioning that I would have a relationship where we are completely free to show our love.”“And we do, we do,” he says. “Who could ask for anything more?”"

        "title": "‘Geisha paparazzi’ are back in Kyoto – and the Japanese city is ready to take action",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Geisha and maiko (teenage apprentices training to become geisha) are women who perform Japanese traditional arts such as singing, dancing and playing instruments to entertain customers while they dine and drink.Many of them work and reside in Gion, an elegant and historic quarter of Kyoto, one of Japan’s most popular tourist cities. When these women travel between work and home they must walk through the streets, a beautiful sight in their traditional kimonos and makeup.However, the geishas’ commutes are also a tourist attraction, with throngs of visitors trying to snap photos of them as they make their way through the picturesque streets. As a result, an unfortunate nickname has even been given to these tourists: “geisha paparazzi.”Foreign tourists have sometimes struggled to understand Japanese customs and etiquette. In 2015, Kyoto created pamphlets and paper handouts that used pictograms to illustrate travel “nuisance activities” like littering, using selfie sticks, smoking in prohibited areas, and taking photos of geisha and maiko.But it was photography, especially “geisha paparazzi,” that proved the biggest headache, reaching a boiling point in 2019 when there were reports of badly behaved visitors tugging at women’s kimonos, chasing them around with cameras and smartphones, pulling out their hair ornaments (kanzashi) and even hitting them with cigarette butts. That year, Gion began putting up signs and notices prohibiting photography, warning that violators would face a fine.But Isokazu Ota, representative secretary of the Gion-town South Side District Council, tells CNN that the “paparazzi” have gotten more brazen since the return of mass tourism to Japan after the pandemic.Today, signs in three languages also explain that geisha photography is not allowed without a permit, and that violators could be charged up to ¥10,000 ($67).However, according to Ota, this fine is unenforceable.Gion’s local council is moving to make small side alleys completely closed off to tourists by April 2024. But the main thoroughfare of Gion, Hanamikoji, cannot be subject to the photography ban since it is a public street. Most maiko and geisha (these words are both singular and plural in Japanese) use this road, making it the prime spot for “paparazzi” to gather.“The people taking pictures of the streets of Gion on the main street and the tourists taking pictures of maiko from afar are probably unaware of the rule against photography,” says Ota. “But I think the foreign tourists waiting for maiko to come out in the alleys of Gion’s photography-prohibited areas know the rules but are ignoring them. Even if we warn tourists, it is difficult to get through to them at this point.”As a result, Ota says some individual locals have taken it upon themselves to discipline badly behaving tourists.Still, Ota and other Gion residents are looking for ways to curb the “geisha paparazzi” issues. He has suggested requiring all tourists to the neighborhood be required to have a Japanese tour guide who can educate them about etiquette.He also believes that more education will help people find ways to meet and interact with maiko and geisha without harassing them in the street.For instance, the local Gion Theatre, located off of Hanamikoji Street, periodically hosts performances by maiko, after which audience members can have their pictures taken with the women.While geisha are only in Japan, issues with photography etiquette have grown tremendously in the age of social media.Hanoi’s popular “train street,” where houses are perched just a few inches away from a working colonial-era train track, became a huge hit on Instagram in recent years.However, with the tracks still very much in active use and near-injuries becoming a bigger safety issue, Hanoi’s local government ordered all the cafes along “Train Street” to close in 2022 and pulled their business licenses.Large barricades were erected to keep people off of the tracks.On the other side of the world, a trend emerged where visitors took pictures to make it look like they were “picking noses” of Easter Island’s famous Moai sculptures.The combination of overtourism and bad photo etiquette has led to a series of controls on the island. Tourist visas were slashed from 90 days to 30, and visitors can only walk on designated paths instead of getting up close to the moai."

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Walt Disney World has put 2025 tickets on sale, and prices for many tickets have gone up from 2024 pricing.Some of the lowest single-day, single-park ticket prices have gone up by $10 for 2025.For example, some late-August weekday tickets at Disney’s Animal Kingdom have gone from $109 for 2024 tickets to $119 for 2025.Other single-day tickets for different parks during different periods are also showing increases over many 2024 prices.For example, on a Saturday in late April when demand is high, Animal Kingdom is $169 in 2025, up from $164 in 2024.Magic Kingdom also rose by $5, from $184 to $189, on that same weekend day in late April.The maximum single-day, single-park ticket published price for 2025 is $189 as of February 27. That’s the same as the peak price in 2024. Ticket prices for November and December 2025 were not yet available as of February 27.Prices on the Park Hopper options that allow guests to visit multiple parks on the same day have also gone up by about $5 to $10 for many dates in 2025.This isn’t the first price hike at Disney parks in recent years.Two increases were implemented in 2022 at Walt Disney World. Disneyland has also increased prices more than once recently.The way Walt Disney World is rolling out its latest price changes is new, according to Don Munsil, who runs the travel website MouseSavers.com.“In the past, Disney just raised all the ticket prices at once rather than rolling out new prices as they added new dates to their calendar,” Munsil said in an email. “The last time the prices went up, a specific date might be $144 on one day, and then after the price increase that same exact date is now $151. So this new strategy is interesting, because all the 2024 prices remained unchanged.”Munsil said multiday ticket prices also rose by $5 to $10 per day for 2025.He added that Disney could still choose to raise 2024 prices.“But if this holds, it represents a new way of raising prices that makes ticket pricing stable for a specific date,” Munsil said.In good news for Disney guests, Walt Disney World has introduced a water park perk for visitors who book at a Disney Resort hotel in 2025. Admission on check-in day to one of the water parks — Typhoon Lagoon or Blizzard Beach — is included in their stay."

        "title": "‘We’re getting into the big leagues in the champagne world’: How artisanal labels are redefining Dubai’s bar scene",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "At the bar on the 30th floor of The Lana — the first hotel from the Dorchester Collection to open in Dubai — chic clientele sip from glass flutes overlooking the City of Gold’s dazzling array of skyscrapers, silhouetted against the dark dunes beyond.The bar, which opened earlier this month, is called High Society, a reference to the clientele who have typically enjoyed its signature drink: champagne.The hotel’s director of food and beverage, Nicolas Caupain, is a self-confessed champagne aficionado, and designed the bar concept to allow guests to experience champagne “not just as celebratory wine but as a nice wine which you can enjoy every day,” he says.It’s an unusual concept for Dubai. The Emirate has a complicated relationship with alcohol: in Islam, the official religion of the United Arab Emirates, alcohol consumption is prohibited. However, the city’s diverse, expat-heavy population and its push to grow its tourism sector has seen many of its alcohol laws relaxed in recent years, including decriminalizing alcohol in 2020 and scrapping its 30% alcohol sales tax last year, although Muslims are still prohibited from acquiring a license to buy alcohol.While the city has over 13,000 restaurants, its bar scene has largely been confined to Michelin fine dining, nightclubs, and boozy brunches. Venues that emphasize the design and diversity of their drinks menus are few and far between.But Caupain believes “there is a market in Dubai who are looking for this level of refinement and discovery,” and that High Society is part of a movement towards casual drinking venues.Unlike other wines, champagne undergoes a second fermentation in the bottle, which gives it its signature fizz, making “every champagne different,” Caupain adds. Champagne is left to mature for at least 15 months, although vintages are left for up to 10 years. This unusual process creates a vast range of flavor profiles, exemplified by High Society’s 118 labels and extensive “by the glass”menu — one of the largest collections in the UAE, claims Caupain.High Society’s collection ranges from well-known champagne houses like Pol Roger (the favored champagne of Queen Elizabeth II and Winston Churchill) to artisanal-like “grower champagnes” Egly Ouriet, Larmandier Bernier, and Ulysse Collin.As the name suggests, these lesser-known labels are small-scale champagne producers that grow their own grapes — and they are surging in popularity globally, says Samuel Lacroix, wine director at Al Muntaha, a Michelin-starred European fine-dining restaurant at the iconic Burj Al Arab hotel.“Smaller labels tend to produce super cool, exclusive and delicious champagnes,” says Lacroix.Al Muntaha, which was recognized by Star Wine List as having the best sparkling wine list in the UAE earlier this year, has 166 labels on its champagne list, including around 60 recently added grower champagnes, says Lacroix. Dubai’s changing demographic, which in the past two years has included an influx of business elite and professionals attracted by the Emirate’s golden visa, is pushing the city’s food and beverage scene to compete with other international cities, he says, adding: “The clientele is getting more refined.”The UAE already dominates for its wine selection in a region that generally has restrictive alcohol laws — in 2022, it was the largest importer of champagne in the Middle East and Africa, according to data from the Comité Champagne trade association, importing nearly three times as many bottles as the rest of the Arabian Peninsula combined — but suppliers favor the big champagne houses, which are easier to buy in bulk, says Lacroix. However, as more world-class sommeliers and chefs descend on the city, they’re bringing with them preferences for more unique products and culinary experiences.“To have all of these champagne names here, I think that we’re getting into the big leagues in the champagne world,” says Lacroix.More and more restaurants in Dubai are offering unusual wines and champagnes, such as Josette, a French restaurant that opened in 2023 and serves its own private-label champagne, and BOCA, winner of the 2023 Green Michelin Star, which offers a list of organic, biodynamic or eco-conscious sparkling wines.Even Dubai’s national airline, Emirates, is on board with the city’s penchant for fizz: in December 2022 it became the only commercial airline in the world officially serving Moët & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot and Dom Pérignon onboard and claims it purchases more champagne than any other airline in the world.Award bodies are also beginning to pay attention to the region: Gault&Millau, a French dining guide, opened its UAE office in Dubai in 2022, launching the UAE Champagne index the same year; and just last month, Star Wine List, a Swedish publication, launched its inaugural awards for the UAE. For both awards, the majority of winners and nominees were located in Dubai.While the bar scene is evolving quickly, it still faces challenges, often stemming from the country’s history of alcohol prohibition: there are just two wine suppliers in the city and a 50% customs duty on alcohol. Additionally, many venues are not set up for the kind of storage that fine wines and champagnes require — a major problem for smaller or independent restaurants, says Lacroix, as storing wine incorrectly in Dubai’s year-round heat could damage the stock.And the culture around drinking is largely focused on dining or special occasions, with little in between, says Krister Bengtsson, founder of Star Wine List.“This more relaxed setting of sharing wine, it’s not really present yet — whereas if you’re in Paris, London, New York, (wine bars) are really where things are happening,” says Bengtsson, adding that new venues like High Society could help create a “casual wine culture” that emphasizes the drinks rather than food.“It’s interesting to see a lot of good wines and champagnes by the glass at unusually lower prices in the Dubai market, to allow people to taste the wines,” says Bengtsson.The growing interest in artisanal labels is also “adding a new layer of perspective both for wine lovers and restaurants,” and “putting pressure on the importers to add more diversity and smaller scale to their portfolio,” Bengtsson adds — all things that are pushing the city’s drinks scene to evolve.At High Society, Caupain hopes that a luxurious finger food menu (designed by French chef Jean Imbert to pair with champagne) and a vinyl DJ will create a laid-back atmosphere that allows guests to enjoy champagne on a range of occasions — and launch a new era for Dubai’s bar scene.“Our pricing strategy is made for people to keep coming back — come on a Tuesday with friends, come back with a partner on a Thursday, or a business partner on the weekends,” says Caupain, adding: “We want to make a lifestyle destination.”"

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Mexico’s most dangerous active volcano spewed ash and smoke on Tuesday, with photos showing massive columns of gray emissions – large enough to ground nearby flights.The Popocatépetl volcano sits in central Mexico between the states of Morelos, Puebla and the State of Mexico.Ash fall was reported in Mexico City and its surrounding region, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the volcano, according to the National Civil Protection Coordination.Mexico’s National Center for Disaster Prevention said it recorded 77 discharges from the volcano and issued a level two volcanic threat level, which requires taking preventative measures and staying a distance away.Some airlines had to cancel operations out of Mexico City’s Benito Juárez International Airport (AICM), according to the airport.Some 25 million people live in a 60-mile (96-kilometer) radius of the volcano, but the civil protection body said there is currently no “risk for the population.”The volcano had been dormant for decades until its eruption in 1994 – and recent activity had put residents on high alert. Since then, its rumblings have become a part of daily life for those living close by.In 2019, the Popocatépetl erupted 14 times in one night. Then last May, it spewed enough ash that the Mexico City airport canceled hundreds of flights. Authorities in several states suspended in-person classes and warned residents to prepare for evacuation – though volcanic activity eventually slowed."

        "title": "A short history of the long fight over breakfast tacos",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos.In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of habañero-hot debate.A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue.But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico.The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate.There’s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN “Searching for Mexico” series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo León.There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Doña Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.“The breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it’s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,” narrates Longoria.CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel – born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years – to find out more.“When I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.”Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as “a really fast food, but not a junkie food.”Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo León are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.Some of the city’s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you’re in meat country.Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey.Compañia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came “to work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.”And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. “I think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.”Along with Doña Mary’s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you’re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony’s Tacos.The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them.“No Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,” says José Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande.“It comes from Mexico – where exactly, it’s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.”As for today, “they’re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila, which all border Texas,” he said.Eddie Vega – who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state – is known as “Taco Poet of Texas.” He points out that historically, what’s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.Before 1836, “the border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.”Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren’t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media.“When you get to south Texas, and I’m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It’s not something we’d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody’s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.”Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them?Austin has “a great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,” Ralat said. “They try some options, and then in their minds, they think it’s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff … and let history speak for itself.”Ralat said San Antonio has “a bit of an inferiority complex that they’re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it’s more diverse, and the food is better.”“To be clear, they’re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they’re also border food. When the Eater article came out” – championing Austin as “home” of the breakfast taco – “San Antonians lost their minds.”Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. “I don’t know that one city – San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo – can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.”Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them.“I think at this point we’ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,” Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. “Is there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.”She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.She also points out the regional differences within Texas.“A flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.”Ralat said he’s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.“I hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. … I want the food to be high quality. I don’t want it to be spin.”Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them – with or without huevos (eggs).“Breakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,” she said.“Bean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn’t have eggs. … Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn’t require eggs. Barbacoa – made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks – is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.”In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter?“Part of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you’ve part of that conversation for a long time.” Vega said.And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.“I think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey … and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.”They’re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. “The place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.”For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning.“I think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture.“It’s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let’s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That’s so nice. And it’s just so joyful.”"

        "title": "Willy Wonka-inspired experience sparks outrage and online mockery after police called to event",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Families attending a Willy Wonka-inspired event in Glasgow, Scotland were promised “optical marvels” and “extraordinary props” for a £35 ($44) ticket, but when they arrived they found a sparsely decorated warehouse and offered a quarter cup of lemonade — or limeade when supplies ran out.People there became so angry on Saturday that the police were called, Police Scotland confirmed to CNN, the event was canceled, and the story went viral on social media.“There was a crowd of people outside all furious,” Paul Connell, one of the actors hired to perform at the event told CNN on Wednesday.“I saw people shouting, the people running the event were crying … It was absolute chaos. There were people walking all over the set at this point, control had been lost completely.”On Facebook, organizers House of Illuminati said: “Today has been a stressful and frustrating day for many and for that we are truly sorry.”“This was an event gone wrong,” another post said. “The house of illuminati will NOT be holding any other event in the foreseeable future.”House of Illuminati had promoted the event with an extravagant website, filled with fantastical images and long descriptions of an “Enchanted Garden,” “Imagination Lab,” and a “Twilight Tunnel.”The 15-page script Connell was given the day before said there were “all these special effects,” but when he asked the organizers for more information, they “kept saying don’t worry about it, do whatever you want, we’ll sort it out (on the day).”When he showed up the next day, however, the warehouse was still “pretty much empty, except for a few plastic mushrooms,” far removed from what had been promoted.Jack Proctor and his family were among those attending the experience, and they arrived once the event had been open for a couple of hours, he told CNN on Wednesday.“We were met by groups of families leaving the event, looking utterly bewildered,” he said. “We were directed upstairs and arrived at a large makeshift prop gate saying ‘Factory.’ A partition blocked our view, but we could tell it wasn’t going to be good … it was even worse than anticipated.”It took Proctor and his family three minutes to see the entirety of the experience for which he had paid a total of £95, he added, and they left shortly afterwards as security were turning people away.“Two Oompa Loompas were handing out candy … Each kid got a jelly bean each and a lollipop, the adults were told not to touch the sweets.”Videos posted on social media showed a figure in a cloak and mask emerging from behind a mirror, with children watching on, sounding increasingly horrified.“Almost every child who saw him ran off crying,” Proctor said.People swapped stories on a Facebook group set up by those who were left disappointed, one person said their children had received two jelly babies and a quarter of a can of limeade, another that their two kids “actually had fun (bless them, they’re easily pleased!).”The actors were “mortified by the whole thing,” Connell said and “trying to make it as nice an experience as possible … but the person running the event said I was spending too much time with the kids and I needed to move them through as quickly as possible.”CNN attempted to contact House of Illuminati for comment via the email addresses available on their website but the emails bounced back."

        "title": "‘I want to get off the plane.’ The passengers refusing to fly on Boeing’s 737 Max",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Ed Pierson was flying from Seattle to New Jersey in 2023, when he ended up boarding a plane he’d never wanted to fly on.The Seattle resident booked with Alaska Airlines last March, purposefully selecting a flight with a plane he was happy to board – essentially, anything but a Boeing 737 Max.“I got to the airport, checked again that it wasn’t the Max. I went through security, got coffee. I walked onto the plane – I thought, it’s kinda new,” Pierson told CNN. “Then I sat down and on the emergency card [in the seat pocket] it said it was a Max.”He got up and walked off.“A flight attendant was closing the front door. I said, ‘I wasn’t supposed to fly the Max.’ She was like, ‘What do you know about the Max?,’” he said.“I said, ‘I can’t go into detail right now, but I wasn’t planning on flying the Max, and I want to get off the plane.’”Pierson made it to New Jersey – after some back and forth, he said, Alaska’s airport staff rebooked him onto a red-eye that evening on a different plane. Spending the whole day in the airport was worth it to avoid flying on the Max, he said.Pierson has a unique and first-hand perspective of the aircraft, made by Boeing at its Renton factory in the state of Washington. Now the executive director of airline watchdog group Foundation for Aviation Safety, he served as a squadron commanding officer among other leadership roles during a 30-year Naval career, followed by 10 years at Boeing – including three as a senior manager in production support at Renton itself, working on the 737 Max project before its launch.But he’s one of a number of travelers who do not want to board the aircraft which has been at the heart of two fatal crashes, as well as the January 5 incident in which part of the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines plane blew out mid-air. The part – a door plug – was found to be missing four bolts that should have held it in place. Further reports of “many” loose bolts and misdrilled holes have emerged from the subsequent investigations into the Max 9 model after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered the grounding of 171 Max 9 aircraft with the same door plug.Experts agree that the Alaska incident could have been worse, and the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has warned that “something like this can happen again.”The previous model, the Max 8, was involved in two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people. The crashes were widely attributed to the malfunctioning of MCAS, an automated system in the Max designed to stabilize the pitch of the plane, overriding pilot input in some circumstances. Boeing accepted its liability in 2021 for one of the crashes.Weeks after the Alaska incident, Boeing CEO David Calhoun told investors on a quarterly call: “We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA at every turn… This increased scrutiny, whether it comes from us or a regulator or from third parties will make us better.”“We caused the problem, and we understand that,” Calhoun said. “Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.”In February, in the wake of the Alaska incident, the company removed the head of the Max program from his position and reshuffled other senior management figures.The move comes as critics have repeatedly said that the aircraft manufacturer is prioritizing profits over safety.The FAA is now “taking a holistic look at the quality control issues at Boeing to ensure safety is always the company’s top priority,” a spokesperson for the government agency told CNN. Representatives are on the ground assessing the production lines at Boeing’s Renton factory and Spirit AeroSystems, whose Wichita, Kansas factory made the door plug that blew off mid-flight in the Alaska incident.On February 28, the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to address quality and safety issues.Boeing told CNN: “Every day, more than 80 airlines operate about 5,000 flights with the global fleet of 1,300 737 MAX airplanes, carrying 700,000 passengers to their destinations safely. The 737 MAX family’s in-service reliability is above 99% and consistent with other commercial airplane models.”Of course, many thousands of people board Max aircraft with no concerns. But do other passengers care? It appears that enough do.The last time the Max was grounded – for 20 months, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 on a Max 8 in March 2019 – 25% of the 1,005 Americans questioned in a Reuters/Ipsos poll said that they had “not a lot” or “no” confidence in the aircraft – compared to 31% who did, and 44% who were unsure. The poll was taken in December 2020, shortly before the aircraft’s return to the skies.After being “told about the aircraft’s safety issues,” a further 57% said they would be somewhat unlikely or not likely to fly in a Max, according to the report. Nearly half – 45% – said that they would still be somewhat unlikely or not very likely to fly in it after it had been back in the air for six months. And 31% of all respondents said that they had little to no confidence that the Federation Aviation Administration (FAA) “puts passenger and crew safety first when determining whether an aircraft is fit to fly.”Most countries cleared the Max 8 to fly again by 2021, but three years on, there still appears to be negative public opinion about the Max.“It’s unsettling that there have been so many issues with this specific type of plane,” Stephanie King, a passenger on the affected Alaska Airlines flight, told CNN in January. “I hope something is done so that this doesn’t happen again.”Then there’s flight booking site Kayak, which has seen usage of its filter to deselect Max aircraft (models 8 and 9) during the booking process increase 15-fold since January, the company told CNN. The site introduced the filter in March 2019, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash.Doubts have also remained across the industry as a whole. Following the Alaska incident, a February AP-Norc poll regarding air travel safety found nearly a third of Americans surveyed answered “not at all” or “a little” when asked if they believe that airplanes are safe from structural faults. While planes were generally viewed to be as safe as cars or trains for means of transportation, fewer than two in 10 surveyed strongly agreed that planes are fault-free.Belén Estacio has boycotted the Max since the January incident. Shortly after the Alaska Airlines fuselage blowout, she was scheduled on a Max for a work flight.“My boyfriend didn’t want me to fly on it so I changed my travel plans to make sure I wasn’t flying on any type of Max,” she said.“It doesn’t matter which model, I don’t want to fly them.” To her, she said, “The Alaska incident was further confirmation that Boeing is still not being thorough and not fixing its issues.”Florida-based Estacio, who works in marketing, now checks the aircraft type before booking any flight. She’s made two trips since January.“The whole thing of, ‘If it’s not Boeing I ain’t going,’ it’s totally the opposite now,” she said. “I’m very happy when I’ve seen I’ll be flying an Airbus.”She says she’s not the only one in her circle, and says she knows people employing both “soft” and “hard” boycotts.“Some say, ‘Absolutely not,’ others say, ‘If I can change it, I will; if not I’ll just go on it.’”UK-based communications consultant Elayne Grimes is another with a personal boycott. Grimes, who travels regularly for work, was worried following the Max 8’s first crash in October 2018: Lion Air flight 610, in Indonesia, which killed all 189 onboard a plane in service for less than three months. Grimes – who’d previously worked in emergency crisis management – was immediately concerned about Boeing’s new aircraft, which had launched to great fanfare in 2017.“I actively sought out airlines that didn’t have the Max,” she said. When Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed in March 2019, killing another 157 people, it confirmed her resolve.In 2022, Grimes watched “Downfall: The Case Against Boeing,” a Netflix documentary directed by Rory Kennedy, which looked at the two tragedies and flagged concerns about the working environment at Boeing.“I watched that and thought [Boeing] was an organization putting profit before people, and thought, ‘That’s not for me.’ I don’t see myself flying one in the near future,” she said.While the FAA has cleared the Max to fly once more, Grimes believes that “its issues are not resolved.”“When the door came off and they called [the planes] in and found other aircraft with issues, I thought ‘Hmm,’” she said. “It’s just not an aircraft I’d want to fly.”Grimes is a self-declared “avgeek,” or aviation fanatic – and she’s not the only one monitoring the industry closely to have reservations. Elliot Sharod, who says he took 78 flights last year, is on the fence. “I wouldn’t exactly refuse to fly it, but I’d ideally fly an Airbus if given the choice,” he said.A former aviation journalist, who wished to remain anonymous for professional reasons, says they lost trust after the second crash.“After the first one, the predominant talking points were, ‘Oh, it’s got to be pilot error, or the weather – it can’t be the plane,” they say. “It was Boeing. I believed that everything coming out of Boeing had been tested and retested – it had to be something else.“Then the Ethiopian crash happened, and there was a bit of the same messaging, but finally it came out that actually it was the plane. I lost all trust at that point in the Max.”They say they still love flying the “older style of Boeings – the 777s and the original 737s.”“They were all designed back in the days when engineers ruled Boeing,” they say. “I feel I can trust them more than the Max.”“Would you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn’t.”They sound like the words of an anxious passenger in 2024. In fact, they were written by one Boeing employee to another in February 2018 – eight months before the Lion Air crash. (In the internal communications, their co-worker replied, simply, “No.”)In April 2017, in internal messages by Boeing employees working on the soon-to-be-released Max, another employee wrote, “This airplane is designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.” The same exchange included a reference to the aircraft’s “piss poor design.” A design tweak was labelled as “patching the leaky boat.”These internal communications were released as part of the 18-month investigation into the Max by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In a 238-page report, released in September 2020, the committee outlined “the serious flaws and missteps in the design, development, and certification of the aircraft.” The report highlighted five key themes, including “production pressures that jeopardized the safety of the flying public” and a “culture of concealment” at Boeing.At the time, Boeing said that the communications “do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable.” The company issued a statement acknowledging the committee’s findings and saying that the victims of the crashes were “in our thoughts and prayers.”Boeing said that when the Max 8 returned to service it would be “one of the most thoroughly scrutinized aircraft in history, and we have full confidence in its safety.”It added: “We have been hard at work strengthening our safety culture and rebuilding trust with our customers, regulators, and the flying public… We have made fundamental changes to our company… and continue to look for ways to improve.”The House Committee report also included concerns about the FAA and its “grossly insufficient oversight” over Boeing during the Max design process and in the period between the two crashes. The report said that “gaps in the regulatory system at the FAA… allowed this fatally flawed plane into service.”A spokesperson for the FAA told CNN: “The FAA made significant improvements to its delegation and aircraft certification processes in recent years and took immediate action following the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines door plug incident to address concerns about the quality of aircraft that Boeing and its suppliers produce.”Rory Kennedy followed the investigation from start to finish. The director of “Downfall” told CNN she didn’t have a “strong opinion” on the plane until she started making the documentary in early 2020.But, she said, “I was shocked by what we discovered… [it] was really disturbing.”Her film is a forensic investigation of the two crashes. “Downfall” interviews ex-Boeing staff and concerned pilots, who paint a picture of an accident waiting to happen. It follows the congressional hearings held as part of the House investigation, and interviews the victims’ families.Kennedy says that during the design process Boeing “went to great pains to hide [MCAS] and how powerful it was.” The stabilizing system was designed specifically for the Max, since the fuel-efficient engines being added to the 1960s-designed plane affected the trim. The House committee found that Boeing concealed its existence from the FAA, airlines and pilots.Additionally, after the Lion Air crash, FAA analysis in December 2018 predicted that without a software fix, a Max could crash on average once every two years over the course of its usage. Yet the plane was not grounded at the time.“Boeing and FAA both gambled with public safety,” House committee chair Peter DeFazio said in a 2020 statement.“We are already undertaking important initiatives based on what we have learned… these initiatives are focused on advancing overall aviation safety by improving our organization, process and culture,” the FAA said in a statement following the committee’s report.“[They] decided to keep the plane in the air, to save money and try to have a fix before the next plane crashed,” said Kennedy. “I interviewed [family members of the victims] as they were understanding that they knew this. Can you imagine?”“I would absolutely not fly that plane,” she told CNN. “I’ve not noticed the culture of Boeing has shifted from one that prioritizes finances over safety.”She says that one of the factors that pushed her to make the documentary, was “talking to pilots who were telling me, ‘Absolutely don’t get on that plane.’”And while she initially received pushback about the film, including from family and friends, “When the door ripped off the airplane, people said, ‘You’re so vindicated.’”Her research also highlighted production issues in the 787 Dreamliner – Boeing’s flagship long-haul aircraft, which debuted in 2011. As a result, she avoids that, too – and suggests that instead of confining their investigations to individual planes, the FAA and NTSB should be investigating Boeing as a whole.A spokesperson for the FAA said that it has blocked production expansion of the Max, and “is conducting enhanced oversight of Boeing and its suppliers. The agency is examining all aspects of Boeing’s three manufacturing lines and Spirit AeroSystems’ supplier activities. A dedicated team of approximately two dozen aviation safety inspectors is conducting these reviews at the Boeing 737 MAX facility in Renton, Washington, and at Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas.”Kennedy wants a “proper hearing” in Congress – similar to the one that investigated the Max crashes.“To me, what you really need is an investigation into the culture of Boeing, what’s happening at board level, and what kind of decisions are being made to continue to prioritize financial interests over the safety of consumers,” she says.Critics say that Boeing’s 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas saw the culture change from one that emphasized engineering prowess to one intent on watching the bottom line.Damning its “broken safety culture,” DeFazio said after the 2020 investigation that “Boeing – under pressure to compete with Airbus and deliver profits for Wall Street – escaped scrutiny from the FAA, withheld critical information from pilots, and ultimately put planes into service that killed 346 innocent people.”In 2021, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle criminal charges that the company defrauded the FAA when the Max was first certified.“The reason that [Boeing’s] culture is so damaging is because they are in a numbers game, and they want to make as much profit as possible at any cost. And for me, that cost me my friend,” says Deveney Williams.In March 2019, Williams’ friend, Samya Stumo, was onboard the Ethiopian Airlines flight. The pair had been due to move into an apartment together in Washington, D.C.“I avoid Boeing as much as possible – I try to get on an Airbus even if it costs more or is a different route,” said Williams.“I never knew about plane models prior to this, but I’ve educated myself onto how to see the model when buying a ticket. I’ve got friends who ask how they can switch flights, or figure out how to avoid flying on this. I’ve learned a lot – I don’t want this happening to anyone else.”For Williams, the Alaska incident was a “weird relief” – because it happened in the US. The aspersions that were cast on the pilots of the two crashes didn’t happen in January. “This time, it’s on American soil, I’m presuming it was an American pilot – so they don’t have any other fingers to point.”Torleif Stumo – Samya’s brother – had a similar incident to Ed Pierson, in which he says his plane was switched to a Max at the last moment. Like Pierson, he only noticed when he saw the safety card in the seat pocket of his flight from Panama City to Bogotá in August 2023.“I don’t really have anxiety, I’ve never had panic attacks but that was one of the closest times I ever came,” he says.“The crew were amazing. They had disconnected from the jetway and initially offered to change my seat to first class. But then I told them why I wanted to get off. They immediately understood and brought the plane back [to the gate].”Stumo ended up spending the night at an airport hotel. The airline he was traveling with agreed to rebook him fee-free having listened to a phone call he’d made to customer services when originally buying the ticket. In it, he’d been assured that he wouldn’t be on a Max.Williams and Kennedy both say they’ve had similar experiences with their aircraft switched to a Max at the last minute.Stumo believes that it’s not easy enough for consumers to tell whether they’ve been booked onto a Max. Michael Stumo, Samya and Torleif’s father, wants aircraft types to be “prominently displayed” during the booking process, he tells CNN.Following the January 5 incident, Alaska and United – the US carriers which use the Max 9 – issued waivers allowing passengers unwilling to fly the Max flexibility. These have now expired, but Alaska told CNN that concerned passengers can be rebooked onto a different aircraft for free, by calling reservations.“We have complete confidence in the safety of all our aircraft,” they added.A spokesperson for United said the airline “has no change fees on most tickets. We’re happy to work with customers with concerns to find a solution that works for them.”Pierson’s Foundation for Aviation Safety – established in 2023 as a watchdog for both the aviation industry and the government entities that regulate it – added a page to their website in February for passengers reluctant to fly on the plane. It explains how to check the plane assigned for one’s flight before booking, refusing to board, and rebooking at the airport.Pierson says the foundation gets many requests from the public asking whether it’s safe to fly the Max.The former Boeing employee has been critical of Boeing company since the aircraft was first on the production line. Over the summer of 2018, he sent several messages up the chain at Boeing, having noticed what he now says was an “unstable production line.” In emails which he has since shared publicly, Pierson warned of his concerns that the intense pressure to get planes out of the factory was leading exhausted workers to cut corners. He feared that it could end in tragedy, he wrote.Having taken early retirement in August 2018 – “I knew it was an unhealthy working environment and couldn’t support the leadership anymore,” he told CNN – he wrote again to the board of Boeing, as well as to the FAA, after the Lion Air crash, and then again after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. He later testified at the congressional hearing.“I would definitely not fly that plane,” he says now. “The same problems that I saw in 2017 and 2018 have not been resolved. The factory is still putting huge amounts of pressure on employees that build the planes, and they’ve had many production quality defects that just came to light.”Although the Max is flying once more, its future appears to be up in the air. The FAA has capped production of new aircraft, and launched an investigation “into whether Boeing failed to maintain their quality system in accordance with federal regulations.” It has also launched an analysis of “potential safety-focused reforms around quality control,” a spokesperson told CNN.As part of its “enhanced oversight,” FAA teams are reviewing Boeing’s Max production system, and Spirit AeroSystems’ production system for the aircraft’s fuselage. It is also reviewing employee training and qualifications, increasing its onsite presence at Max manufacturing facilities, and looking at “how Boeing transfers unfinished work from suppliers to its production lines,” a spokesperson told CNN.Meanwhile, the NTSB’s investigation into what happened on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 continues.A preliminary NTSB report does not lay blame on Boeing nor find a probable cause, which is typically included in the NTSB’s final report which could take a year or more.Spirit said following the incident it was cooperating with the NTSB and added, “as a company, we remain focused on the quality of each aircraft structure that leaves our facilities.”For Michael Stumo, the Alaska incident proved his fears. “We have nine years of [Boeing] getting caught, promising to do better, and they don’t,” he said. “Now we have this: where they can’t even put plug doors in a plane, can’t fix bolts.”Stumo wants Boeing to “bring in people who know how to do complex manufacturing processes.”“These people exist. Boeing has a lot of money. Hire them,” he said.A Boeing spokesperson said the company has “invested heavily in our workforce over the last several years.” Engineering staff are up by 10% and manufacturing by 11%, they said, while they have “increased the number of Commercial Airplanes quality inspectors by 20%, and have said we will continue to hire.”“We have also invested in quality across the company, growing the number of quality employees by more than 25%, exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels,” they added.Stumo says the company needs urgent change.“The first crash shouldn’t have happened. The second they had full knowledge of [the MCAS malfunctioning] – it absolutely shouldn’t have happened.“We want no third crash. And we want Boeing transformed back into the superior aviation engineering company making amazing and safe products that it was.”"

        "title": "How to survive a shark attack – or better yet, avoid one entirely",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "First things first: Despite some truly terrifying tales of survival, you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon.But sharks do occasionally attack humans – and they certainly make news when they do:• Rockaway Beach Park in Queens, New York, was closed to swimming and surfing on August 8, one day after a woman was hospitalized after suffering an apparent shark bite.• A teenager was bitten by a shark on the foot in early July as he was surfing off the coast of New York’s Fire Island.• A Russian citizen was killed by a shark in the Red Sea in Egypt on June 8.• A shark attacked a woman from Connecticut while she was snorkeling at a resort in Turks and Caicos on May 24.While these kinds of encounters understandably cause would-be ocean swimmers to worry, there’s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation. The chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low despite the headlines.The Florida Museum of Natural History’s International Shark Attack File found only 57 confirmed, unprovoked shark bites on people and 32 confirmed, provoked bites in 2022 worldwide.Think about it a minute – the world population is more than 8 billion people. Many of those live near or vacation at the coast. And only 89 bites were logged. Your chances of drowning are much, much higher.In 2022, the United States led the way in unprovoked attacks at 41; Florida had the highest state total at 16.That said, you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack, according to shark experts interviewed by CNN Travel.Know your environmentSharks are salt-water creatures. The ocean is their home; we are the visitors.“If you’re going to the ocean, you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is,” said Neil Hammerschlag, director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.“Fortunately, humans aren’t on the menu, and also fortunately, sharks tend to avoid people.”Still, there are places you’re more likely to encounter a shark.River mouths are not the best place to swimYou should avoid estuaries, said Richard Peirce, an author, shark expert and former chair of the UK-based Shark Trust and Shark Conservation Society.Their often-murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks, which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks.“An awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths, where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river – people washing their clothes, people washing themselves,” said Peirce.Hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely: deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out.Avoid areas with fishingBefore you jump in the sea, have a look around the horizon: What do you see? If you see fishing boats, Peirce says “forget it.”“Whether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational, material will often be being discarded, and unwanted dead fish, fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks,” he said.Before you go in, watch for unusual fish activity, such as a whole bunch of small- and medium-sized fish jumping out of the water, Hammerschlag said. That’s a possible sign a shark might be nearby.He also advised to not swim within roughly 50 yards of where someone is fishing from shore.Avoid dusk and dawnSwimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely, but it’s also the time when a shark attack is most likely.“A lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity,” Peirce says, “due to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark.”Hang with lifeguardsChris Lowe, professor in marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, advises to “do your homework” before you go into unfamiliar waters. Bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places.If you have any questions, ask a local lifeguard. He said they are a great resource.“I always recommend people go to guarded beaches. It’s a lot safer,” he said.Don’t wear shiny objects in the water“Be careful with jewelry, anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish.” Lowe said.In murky water, a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal. “And you don’t want your hand or foot to get confused with that.”Follow your instincts“Probably the most important thing is to follow your gut,” Hammerschlag said. “If you feel wary about getting in the water … just don’t go in the water.”“A lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that, like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn’t listen to it,” he said.Don’t panicSo you’re being circled by a shark. The worst thing you can do right now is panic.“Don’t start splashing around – you’re just going to excite, incite and encourage the shark’s interest,” said Peirce.Humans, apes, dogs and cats all have paws and hands. If we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it, we feel it, we put it to our nose.“A shark has got no paws or hands, so if it wants to explore something, the only capability it’s got to do that is to put it in its mouth,” said Peirce.“That’s why we often get exploratory bites which don’t result in death and sometimes don’t even result in serious injury. If you go swimming and splashing away, you’re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite.”Maintain eye contactAs the shark swims around you, keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact.“Sharks are ambush predators,” Peirce explained. “If you’re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you, it’s not going to be half as comfortable as if it’s able to sneak up from behind.”Hammerschlag concurred, saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you’re following it. Then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore.If you’re surfing, track the shark with your board, Lowe said. “Let the shark know it’s being watched.”Marine biologists and shark divers Adriana Fragola and Kayleigh Grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks. In a viral TikTok video (see top of story), the shark is seen as Fragola splashes away, capturing its attention. She turns around, faces the approaching shark, remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand.“You’re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you,” Fragola says in the video.Stay big or get smallThis is where it gets complicated. If a shark is clearly in attack mode, you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water, according to Peirce.“The bigger you are in the water, the more respect you’ll get,” he said.But if the shark seems to simply be passing through, Peirce’s advice is to roll up into a ball.“If a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source, that can be one reason it attacks you,” he explained.“If I didn’t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor – and if it wasn’t showing massive interest in me – I would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me.”Don’t play deadThis isn’t a bear, it’s a shark. If you find yourself in an aggressive encounter, give it hell: punch, kick and poke at sensitive spots – but be careful where you aim.“There’s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose. That’s OK, but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth,” said Peirce.“This is a moving object in the water and you’re not staying still either, so what you don’t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it.”A good shot to the gills can also do the job: “The gills are very sensitive – giving a shark a whack in the gills isn’t a bad idea.”Are you carrying anything with you? If so, turn it into a weapon.“If you’re a diver with an underwater camera, use it, if you’re a snorkeler, rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark,” Peirce says.“I’ve had a lot of sharks come at me, and it’s (been) enough to use a shark billy – a small metal rod between two and three feet long – and I’ve just given them a little nudge on their nose.”It’s a good idea to swim with other people, Lowe said. Not only does that decrease the chances of an attack, he said, but you’ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten.Cut off the anglesIf you’re a diver and you run into trouble, try to get into a position where the shark can’t get behind you, says Peirce.“Keep your back to something like a coral reef. Then you’ve only got one direction to look. You’re protected from behind, for example, and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is.”Slowly back awayDisplace the least amount of water possible. Try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore.“You must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water. Again, you’ve got to be careful – large sharks can attack in very shallow depths.”Doing the above may help to a degree, but Peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim.“If a white shark is in full attack mode, there’s not much you’re going to be able to do at that point,” he says."

        "title": "Feds propose steep fines when airlines damage wheelchairs",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Airlines damaged or lost more than 11,000 passenger wheelchairs last year – and a new federal proposal seeks cut the inconvenience for wheelchair-reliant travelers with six-figure penalties against airlines.The Department of Transportation proposal, unveiled Thursday, would establish new airline passenger rights. Those include the right of immediate notification when a wheelchair is lost or damaged, the right to a loaner and the right to choose how the wheelchair is repaired.It would also set a federal fine of up to $124,000 for violations and require airlines enhance employee training.“What we’re really trying to do is make clear that just like a number of other passenger protections that are encoded by rule or by law, taking proper care of wheelchairs and passengers who use them is fundamental – it’s required,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told reporters on a conference call.An estimated 5.5 million Americans use a wheelchair, DOT said.Damage to a wheelchair is just one of the risks disabled people face when traveling.Because wheelchairs do not fit into aircraft cabins, people who use wheelchairs are lifted onto a special onboard wheelchair known as an aisle chair – and then lifted again into their seats. This process can cause injuries, and some passengers have been hospitalized.On board the plane, wheelchair-reliant passengers face a choice: Seek assistance getting to the on-board bathroom or avoid it. Disability advocates say some passengers put their health at risk by dehydrating themselves before a flight, reducing the changes of needing to move to the lavatory.Some travelers have arrived at the gate and learned their chair is too big to fit in the aircraft’s cargo hold, too. Smaller commuter aircraft, for example, may not have space for larger powered chairs.Some passengers say their chairs were shipped on a later flight; others had to change their plans. Proposed legislation would require airlines to provide passengers with cargo space details in advance.Buttigieg cast the proposal as part of his broader push to overhaul the airline passenger experience – including changes to fees and seating for families – and a specific focus on wheelchairs.DOT has set standards for bathroom access for wheelchair users, and he said the department is evaluating as a longer-term goal the possibility of wheelchairs flying in the cabin rather than the cargo hold. But the idea of a wheelchair user flying while seated in his or her own wheelchair “will take years and will require more research, more development” before becoming reality, he said.Buttigieg defended the steep fines as appropriate for the circumstances.“Often passengers are waiting weeks or more for their chair to be repaired or replaced,” he said. “That means it doesn’t just affect their trip – it affects their lives, long after their trip is over.”Airlines for America, which represents the largest US passenger carriers, said the airlines are “committed to offering a high level of customer service and providing a positive and safe flight experience for passengers with disabilities.” The group said it would continue working with groups and regulators to “explore safe and feasible aircraft solutions that reduce barriers to air travel.”Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the Illinois Democrat who leads the Senate aviation subcommittee, said at a White House event on Thursday that she thinks the fines will “wake up the airlines” to the problems experienced by disabled travelers.“As someone who does travel with a wheelchair, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen my own assistive devices and others’ broken,” Duckworth said. “And people don’t realize this is a part of my body. If this is broken, you’ve broken my legs.”The next step is for a 60-day public comment period, followed by further DOT review and work towards a final rule. Other major passenger experience rules proposed by Buttigieg’s agency have taken several years before taking effect."

        "title": "London’s futuristic BT Tower landmark to become hotel",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Tourists who fancy getting a top-down view of London may soon be able to book themselves a room in the city’s famous BT Tower.A much-loved part of the London skyline, the former communication tower has just been sold for £275 million ($347 million) to MCR Hotels, which plans to open it up to the public by “repurposing it as a hotel.”According a statement from telecom company BT Group on Wednesday, the sale is “securing its (the tower’s) place as a London landmark for the future.”When the building was completed in 1964 it overtook the Millbank Tower in Westminster to become the British capital’s tallest structure. Situated in Fitzrovia, central London, it was officially opened by the then-prime minister, Harold Wilson, the following year. The main structure is 581 feet (177 meters) high, but an additional section of aerial rigging brings it up to 620 feet.Originally known as the Post Office Tower, the building was designed to relay microwave signals carrying telecommunications from London around the country. However, it has gradually been replaced by the company’s fixed and mobile networks. Its dish-like microwave aerials were removed more than 10 years ago as they were no longer needed.It remained London’s tallest building until 1980, when it was overtaken by the NatWest Tower in the financial district. Both have since been massively eclipsed by the Shard, which towers over the city at 1,016 feet (310 meters) high.The building, which has a grade II listing from national heritage body Historic England, was open to the public for several years, with a restaurant on a revolving floor at the top.In 1971, however, it closed to the public after a bomb explosion on the 31st floor, for which nobody ever claimed responsibility.In 2009, an LED screen was wrapped around the 36th and 37th floors, with a message proclaiming 1,000 days until the 2012 London Olympics. The “information band,” as it is known, has since been used to display many different messages, including the late Queen’s first tweet, in 2014, and advice to “Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives” during the coronavirus pandemic.In a press release announcing the sale of the site, Brent Mathews, property director for BT Group, said the company had been “immensely proud” to own the “important landmark.”He added: “It’s played a vital role in carrying the nation’s calls, messages and TV signals, but increasingly we’re delivering content and communication via other means. This deal with MCR will enable BT Tower to take on a new purpose, preserving this iconic building for decades to come.”This latest addition will bump up MCR’s portfolio of around 150 luxury hotels, including the TWA Hotel at New York’s JFK airport, a reimagining of Eero Saarinen’s 1962 Flight Center.Also in the Big Apple is the Art Deco New Yorker hotel, which has a rich history and has played host to VIPs from John F. Kennedy to Muhammad Ali.Tyler Morse, CEO and owner of MCR Hotels, said in the press release: “We are proud to preserve this beloved building and will work to develop proposals to tell its story as an iconic hotel, opening its doors for generations to enjoy.”Comparing the project to the company’s transformation of the TWA Flight Center, Morse added: “We see many parallels between the TWA Hotel and the BT Tower.“Both are world-renowned, groundbreaking pieces of architecture. It’s been a privilege to adapt the TWA Flight Center into new use for future generations, as it will be the BT Tower.”"

        "title": "How to survive a cobra bite – or better yet, avoid one entirely",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Thailand is full of snakes – more than 200 species, including cobras. That might be unsettling for some people, but it was ideal for Prangmart Charoenwai as a boy in southern Thailand.He was intrigued by the reptiles. He once captured a nonvenomous sunbeam snake, letting it go days later when he couldn’t feed it properly. He watched online videos to learn techniques in grabbing them, he told CNN.He saw his first cobra when he was about 15 or 16.“It was quite big,” Prangmart, now 39, said. “I later saw that snake spread its hood. I stood there watching its behavior. It threatened me, but I felt it was not scary. … I thought it was beautiful.”His fascination and confidence grew, but his good fortune with cobras didn’t last.In April 2021, the market owner went out on a mission in Trang province in southern Thailand with his rescue group, which responds to routine emergency response tasks, including snake-catching.Residents in the area said they were concerned about some king cobras. Prangmart arrived at the site with about 15 team members.They didn’t find any cobras the first day, but that changed the next day after some thick brush and overgrown vines were cleared out.“I saw a hole in a big rock where I spotted a snake’s tail, and it looked like it was going into that hole,” Prangmart recalled. “I ran there quickly, and then used a hook to try to get it out.”But the snake eluded the device.“Due to my carelessness, because I have been working in this area for too long, I decided to use my bare hand to snatch the cobra’s tail out.”That impulsive grab turned out to be a major miscalculation.Cobras have an extensive range – from much of Africa into the Middle East, then into India and the rest of South Asia. From there, they continue into Southeast Asia and Indonesia. That puts them in potential contact with billions of people.They belong to the elapid family of snakes, which has roughly 300 venomous species. Coral snakes, sea snakes, mambas and kraits are also in this group.There are about 30 cobra species, according to expert Rom Whitaker, who helped start the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust in India. (Its spinoff, the Irula Snake-catchers Industrial Cooperative Society, supplies the venom used to produce life-saving antivenom to India).Whitaker said he uses an approximation of the number of species because cobra taxonomy often changes as experts learn more about the snakes. Africa accounts for roughly two-thirds of the species.Generally, cobras deliver a neurotoxin, which interferes with nerve impulses and can cause paralysis of the heart and lungs. That’s different from that of many vipers, such as rattlesnakes. They generally have a hemotoxin that attacks the blood vessels and causes bleeding and tissue damage.But Nick Brandehoff, who practices emergency medicine and medical toxicology in Colorado and California, said he and other experts are learning that snake venom is more complicated than that simple breakdown. Some elapids have hemotoxic properties, and some vipers have neurotoxic properties. It can vary from snake to snake.Either way, venomous snakebites are a serious problem in many tropical regions. Only an average of five people die a year of venomous snakebites in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But the World Health Organization estimates around 81,000 to 138,000 people die each year worldwide from snakebites, while about three times that many people live with permanent disabilities.Despite the high number of deaths and envenomings (bites in which venom is delivered into the body), don’t assume cobras are aggressive.“Cobras are shy snakes, and though they make a dramatic show when cornered and alarmed, rearing up, spreading a hood, and hissing loudly, this is stark fear, not aggression,” said Whitaker. “The snake only wants to be left alone.”Brandehoff, who helps run the Asclepius Snakebite Foundation, added that “they’re typical of most other snakes in that they don’t want human contact.” And he emphasized cobras don’t chase people.Kim Gray, curator of herpetology and ichthyology with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, cited another reason cobras don’t like to bite people.“Venom is valuable to the snake, and it is used to immobilize prey and begin the digestion process, which the snake needs because it eats whole food items and has no limbs to help it in this process,” Gray said.“So it does not want to waste its venom by recklessly biting and envenoming all the humans it can encounter.”Biting is a last resort if its typical warning signs to back off don’t work, she said.The vast majority of cobra bites happen to agricultural workers in fields and other locals, often low-income people living in easy-to-enter dwellings and who sleep on the floor, Brandehoff said.“Though people have an idea that the ‘jungle is full of snakes,’ that’s really not true,” Whitaker added. “Cobras are most common in agricultural areas thanks to the proliferation of their favorite prey: rats and mice.“Alert snakes like cobras are frightened of humans and usually flee or freeze when a human approaches. The odds of encountering a cobra on the usual tourist routes in India or Thailand are very slim.”People staying in hotels with full facilities in a city have less to worry about than those in rural, rustic facilities, Gray said.If you do find yourself bedding down in a place more likely to attract cobras, she suggested:• Keep debris away from the shelter• Clean up food and grains that might attract rats• Try to keep furniture higher up off the floor and sleep in an elevated bed.Whitaker said it is essential to shine a flashlight when walking at night and not put your hands in thick, bushy spots.The experts are unanimous: Leave the snake alone.“Move deliberately and calmly away from the snake – while keeping an eye on its location if possible,” Gray said. “Move to an open area free of brush and rock outcrops if possible” if you’re outdoors.“Do not try to restrain it, capture it or kill it with a broom or shovel or anything,” she emphasized.Brandehoff concurred. “Give it its space. You are a large mammalian predator to them. They do not want to engage you.”Whitaker said that bites “usually don’t happen from the strike of a cobra in the hooded posture but … happen when the snake is stressed by being stepped upon or mistakenly grabbed.”What should you do if you chance on a cobra that’s already really close and seems ready to strike?“Move quickly away,” Gray said. “Human reaction time is so slow compared to their strike so there may not be much you can do – but typically the trajectory of the cobra’s bite is forward and downward, and they are not able to change direction mid-strike, so perhaps a sideways rapid move away from the snake may be beneficial.”Prangmart Charoenwai’s impulsive maneuver to grab an escaping cobra cost him.“The hole was not deep; the snake made a U-turn out quicker than I thought.”That’s when it happened. Prangmart got bit on his left thumb. Then he got bit on his right hand.Despite the strikes, Prangmart was determined to capture and bag the cobra himself since he was already bitten – even though his left hand was already getting numb.“I was told to step aside; I refused. Instead, they told me to stay chilled and urged me to quickly go to the hospital and treat my wound.”They finally bagged the cobra, and Prangmart was able to walk to an ambulance. But his trouble had just started – the hospital was two hours away.As Prangmart was learning the hard way, cobra bites are very serious business. But they are by no means a death sentence.“Most snakebites, even cobra bites, are not fatal.” Whitaker said. “But any snakebite must be treated as a medical emergency.“The single most important thing to do is to get to a hospital without any delay. Do not resort to any local or home remedy because there is only one cure for a snakebite and that is antivenom.”Gray said that you should try to stay calm and “immobilize the limb that was bitten, get to the closest hospital without delay (and) make a note of where the bite occurred and the time the bite occurred.”Also, get a description or photo of the snake if it can be taken safely. This can help doctors with treatment, she said.Do not tie a tourniquet or try the old “cut and suction” method, Whitaker said, nor should you use a so-called “snakebite kit.”Brandehoff said that if the bite comes from a cobra with strictly neurotoxic venom, people may recommend a crepe wrap, which can help reduce the spread of the venom from a limb to the rest of the body via compression.“The problem with that is most people don’t know what kind of snake bit them” and that it’s not reasonable to expect people to readily ID various cobra species.And if the venom has hemotoxic properties, a wrap can cause more harm than good, damaging tissue around the bite area, he said.Rings and other jewelry should be removed.“The earlier antivenom can be administered, the better your chances of not having long-term disability or potentially dying,” he said.Spitting cobras can cause “venom ophthalmoplegia,” which is basically burning of the eyes, Brandehoff said. Permanent damage can occur but is rarer.The main treatment is washing the eyes “copiously,” he said.Prangmart’s arrival at the hospital in Thailand did not end his emergency. “After I received the serum, I had an allergic reaction,” he said.“I started to have short breaths, rashes. The doctor had to rush back and treated me again. I was watched regularly during that time.”Was he afraid he would die?“The severe conditions I had to endure at the hospital lasted about two hours. It was when I thought I may not make it. My heart rate was racing, too.”Prangmart pulled through the immediate crisis but then embarked on a 15-day ordeal, bouncing between Western medical doctors and practitioners of Thai traditional medicine to try to save his left hand, where repeated infections threatened to spread.He eventually got better, but he’s left with a big scar, an important reminder for him and the rest of his team.“At that time when I saw the snake, I felt excited and I didn’t want it to escape into the hole. Because of that excitement, I hurriedly grabbed the snake. What happened to me, it was my own carelessness.”And if someone else should encounter a cobra?“Keep calm and watch it; don’t hurry, turn your back and run. … If you are very scared, start to retreat backward step by step,” he said. “Generally, these snakes are not likely to attack people first unless there is clear threat to them.”Cobras keep the environment in balance.“Without cobras, the rodent problem in agricultural areas could lead to famine,” Whitaker said. “These are the most efficient rodent predators in existence, able to enter rat burrows and clean out the entire family.”But he said antivenom efforts must continue.“Those of us who appreciate and respect snakes need to support programs to help reduce the tremendous burden of snakebites affecting tens of millions of rural people in Africa, Asia and South America,” Whitaker said.Brandehoff agreed: “We can’t attempt to eradicate snakebites like we can malaria. The best thing we can do is try to mitigate snakebites by trying to minimize contacts.”We need to “learn to live with them. … In a lot of cultures, there’s a lot of fear of snakes. See a snake, kill a snake; it’s not helpful.”"

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Buildings in London don’t come much more historic than St. Paul’s Cathedral. It was designed by 17th century architect Christopher Wren, hosted the funeral for Winston Churchill and was the scene of the current King’s wedding to his first wife, the then Lady Diana, in 1981.Now history lovers with a passion for reading can apply to spend the night in the iconic site.The unique experience is available for just one night only to commemorate World Book Day.For a grand total of just £7 ($9) two guests will spend the night in the cathedral’s “Hidden Library” on Friday March 15 - eight days after the official World Book Day.The bookish pair will be the first people to officially sleep in the iconic church since the St. Paul’s Watch protected the building during World War II, according to a press release from Airbnb on Tuesday.The stay can only be booked through Airbnb from 10 a.m. GMT on March 12. It is not a competition but the lucky guests - who must be over 18 and have a verified Airbnb profile - will be selected on a first come, first served basis.Whoever lands this unique experience will enter the cathedral through the Dean’s door and climb Wren’s famous geometric staircase. Once at the top, the guests will enter the library. They will then be met by the Dean of St. Paul’s who will take them on a tour.Dinner will be laid on at a nearby restaurant, after which the guests will have the chance to delve into an especially curated collection of more than 22,000 books - from timeless classics to upcoming releases.Prospective visitors may want to double check the terms and conditions ahead of booking, however. Applicants must be bookworms, the press release says, and must observe library-style regulations. There’s no eating or drinking in the library and conversations must be softly spoken.And there’s one other minor inconvenience - the lack of en suite facilities. There are no showers and it’s a short walk down a corridor from the hidden library to the nearest toilet.Breakfast will be on offer the following morning, before the visitors will climb to the top of the cathedral’s dome.Sandra Lynes Timbrell, director of visitor engagement at St. Paul’s, said in the release: “The recently restored library at St Paul’s has long been a secret gem of the cathedral – cleverly concealed by the ingenious architecture of Christopher Wren. Some very fortunate guests will now get the chance to delve deeper into the history and wonder of St Paul’s with this truly one of a kind stay.”The opportunity is the latest in a spate of unusual offerings from the accommodation lettings platform, including the chance to spend a night in Santa’s cabin, Shrek’s swamp, Barbie’s DreamHouse and the Moulin Rouge."

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "It’s about to get easier for some foreign travelers to visit China, with the government announcing plans to extend its visa exemption policy to six additional European countries.The exemption will take effect on March 14, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced on Thursday during a press conference on the sidelines of the National People’s Congress meeting in Beijing.“I wish to share with you that starting from March 14, China will further extend, on a pilot basis, visa exemption to six countries, including Switzerland, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg,” Wang said.Visa exemptions for Switzerland and Ireland passport holders were both announced in January when Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited both countries, according to Chinese state media reports, with the other countries listed by Wang being the latest additions.“We hope more countries will offer Chinese citizens visa exempt visa facilitation and work with us to build fast track networks for cross border travels and encourage speedy resumption of international passenger flights,” Wang said, adding this “will make it more convenient for Chinese citizens to travel abroad and make foreign friends feel at home in China.”China’s recent moves to make it easier for travelers from certain countries to visit are part of efforts to boost foreign tourism as its economy struggles to recover.In January, China signed a reciprocal agreement with Thailand and Singapore to permanently waive tourist visa requirements for each other’s citizens from March. In November last year, China announced a trial program to allow visitors from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia to enter visa-free for 15 days.Though US travelers still need a tourist visa to enter China, restrictions have been eased and they no longer have to submit proof of a round-trip flight booking, a hotel reservation, an organized itinerary or a letter of invitation as of January 1, 2024.The Chinese embassy in Washington announced the newly relaxed guidelines on December 29, 2023, citing the desire “to further facilitate people-to-people exchanges.”Foreign travelers have been slow to return to the country, with 2023 arrival numbers down more than 60% from pre-pandemic levels.China’s border authorities recorded 35.5 million entries and exits by foreign nationals last year, according to the National Immigration Administration. That’s nearly seven times more than the number from 2022, when the country was deep in its three-year self-imposed Covid isolation.The 2023 figure is just 36% of the 97.7 million border entries and exits by foreign nationals recorded in 2019, suggesting a long road to full recovery, though momentum picked up toward the end of the year."

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Lena Bychcova couldn’t really believe it when her North Korean tourist visa came through.Many Russian tourists have found themselves locked out of tourism destinations. But North Korea — as a key Russian ally — offered a rare opportunity to travel.The marketing professional was one of about 100 Russian nationals who were allowed to travel to North Korea this month in what is believed to be the hermit kingdom’s first international tourist trip since the coronavirus pandemic.Tourism in North Korea is tightly controlled. Individual travelers are not permitted into the country, and groups are accompanied by minders. Tourism revenue is used to support the regime of dictator Kim Jong Un.Traveling to the “hermit kingdom” is not without significant risks. American college student Otto Warmbier was detained on a North Korea trip in 2016, allegedly for stealing a propaganda poster. He was returned to the United States 17 months later in a vegetative state and died soon after.Bychcova and the rest of the group arrived in Pyongyang on February 9, traveling via a North Korean-owned Air Koryo plane from Vladivostok.While Bychcova admits she was anxious about the trip, she says that curiosity won out and she couldn’t pass up the chance to see a country that few tourists have the opportunity to explore.Travel blogger Ilya Voskresensky, who also joined the tour, felt similarly tense – he listed his part-time job, selling vintage dishes, as his profession rather than revealing he was a content creator. Despite his misgivings, he admits that one reason to go through with the trip was to discover whether modern-day North Korea would compare to the Soviet Russia his family members told him about.“When you look at North Korea you realize that your grandma and grandpa were living like they do here,” Voskresensky tells CNN. “It’s a teleport into the past. There are absolutely no advertisements in the city. The only thing on display are party slogans, flags and so on.”The four-day trip cost each visitor about $750. The group had Russian-speaking guides and translators with them at all times. The itinerary included a visit to the bronze statues of the late leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on Mansu Hill, the Mangyongdae Children’s Palace, where kids put on a music and dance performance, and three days at Masikryong Ski Resort.The Russians were also given strict rules to follow, especially when it came to taking pictures and videos.“We were asked not to photograph the military or people in uniform in general, not to photograph the construction sites or any of the buildings under construction,” Bychcova explains. “And there were rules about how to take photographs and generally treat portraits or sculptures of leaders. If you have a newspaper or magazine with a picture of the leader, then you cannot fold the newspaper so that the portrait becomes wrinkled.”These newspapers became some of her favorite souvenirs from North Korea. Bychcova says that there wasn’t much to buy, but there were two shops – one in the airport and one in the capital – where she and other tourists could get magnets, dolls, Lego sets and other small gifts.Before the pandemic, the largest source of inbound tourists to North Korea wasn’t Russia – it was China.The Russian ski trippers were the first tourists allowed into the hermit kingdom since the pandemic, a sign of Russia’s increasing popularity in North Korea.With global sanctions and a shrinking pool of allies, Russia and North Korea’s increased interest in one another has raised the alarm among US Intelligence officials.North Korea has supplied Russia with missiles to use against Ukraine.In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin presented a car to his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un. The act was a possible violation of United Nations sanctions imposed against the country for its nuclear weapons program.Both Voskresensky and Bychcova say that their decision to travel wasn’t about politics – they went to North Korea eager to get to know local people and form relationships.After returning, though, Bychcova doesn’t believe such a thing is truly possible in the North Korean system.“About 200 kids – we counted them on stage! – had prepared an hour-long concert especially for us. And there were just 97 of us,” she says.“So there were more people on stage than spectators. We could feel they were trying to create a certain image of what North Korea looks like for us. But some details revealed that it was not entirely true, that there is another life.”While the Russians were able to discuss their trip to North Korea and their thoughts on the Kim regime freely, that same privilege does not apply in their own country.Criticism of Putin, Russia’s policies and the military are criminal offenses in Russia.A prominent ex-KGB official turned pro-military blogger who had been vocal in supporting the war in Ukraine was arrested and charged with “extremist activity” last summer for comments critical of Putin.Just last week, a 33-year-old dual citizen of Russia and the United States was arrested in Yekaterinburg and accused of “providing financial assistance to a foreign state in activities directed against Russia security.” The reason? She reportedly donated $51 to a Ukrainian charity.While both Voskresensky and Bychcova were aware of North Korea’s human rights abuses, they both tell CNN they hoped the trip would be worth it in order to connect with regular North Korean civilians.Now, both say they would consider going to North Korea again someday – but only if the political situation changes.“The main message of my content is that anywhere: no matter what country, no matter what nationality, it is regular people who live there, and you should treat people with love everywhere,” says Voskresensky. “I hope traveling will save the world.”Another Russian ski trip in North Korea is slated for March 2024."

        "title": "Nepal to require all Mount Everest climbers to use a tracking chip",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Ahead of the 2024 Mount Everest season, Nepal has announced a new requirement that all climbers must rent and use tracking chips on their journey.“Reputed companies were already using them but now it’s been mandatory for all climbers,” Rakesh Gurung, director of Nepal’s department of tourism, told CNN.“It will cut down search and rescue time in the event of an accident.”He explains that climbers will pay $10-15 apiece for the chips, which will be sewn into their jackets. Once the climber returns, the chip will be removed, given back to the government, and saved for the next person.Tracking chips use the global positioning system (GPS) to share information with satellites.Gurung added that the chips were manufactured in “a European country” but did not specify where or by which company.The majority of people who try to climb the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) Mount Everest do so via Nepal, paying $11,000 apiece just for the climbing permit. Adding in the prices of gear, food, supplemental oxygen, Sherpa guides and more, it costs upwards of $35,000 to take on the mountain.Eight of the world’s ten highest peaks are in Nepal, and the country makes significant tourism revenue from mountaineering.It can take as long as two months to complete the Mount Everest climb. The weather is suitable for summiting during a very small window, usually in mid-May.Last year, Nepal gave out a record 478 climbing permits. Twelve climbers were confirmed to have died on the mountain, while another five remain officially missing.Rescues at “the roof of the world” are risky under even the best of circumstances.In 2023, 30-year-old Gelje Sherpa passed up his own chance at reaching the summit in order to pull off a daring rescue of a Malaysian climber at the Everest “death zone.”“It is almost impossible to rescue climbers at that altitude,” Department of Tourism official Bigyan Koirala told Reuters at the time."

        "title": "She moved to Italy and bought a palazzo for a fresh start. Her ex-husband came with her",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "As they walked through the stunning palazzo and gazed up at its frescoed ceilings, Kelly and Jesse Galloway, originally from Australia, knew that their lives were about to change.The pair, who’ve been divorced since 2013, decided to purchase the historic property, situated in the village of Stimigliano in the central Lazio region of Italy, almost instantly.“The agent led us through this covered walkway, opened the door and brought us into this beautiful big kitchen,” Kelly, a former furniture manufacturer, tells CNN Travel.“Then [we went] through the kitchen and into the main entrance, and I stood and looked up the staircase and began to cry.”Kelly and Jess, who were previously married for 18 years, are now the proud owners of Palazzo Menichelli, which had been left empty for around three decades.So how did this former couple end up moving to a new country and buying a palazzo – a grand Italian residence - together?“We’ve been platonic for many years,” explains Kelly. “But we’re good friends. And I saw it as a chance for Jess to have a home of his own and for me to have a home of my own and [for us to] live happy ever after in this beautiful place.”Kelly had dreamed of a “happy ever after” in Italy long before she’d ever even visited the European country and originally planned to relocate there in 2014.However, things didn’t work out on that occasion and her dream “got put back on the shelf.”When she traveled to Italy for the first time in 2018, Kelly says she fell in love with the country “more than ever.”By the following year, her home in Australia was on the market and she’d put down a deposit on a palazzo located in the town of Alvito in the Lazio region.But as the global Covid-19 pandemic developed, Kelly became nervous about taking on such a big project and pulled out of the deal.Despite this setback, she was determined to move to Italy as soon as she could, and decided to ask Jess if he’d be willing come along to help her settle in.“I had said that I thought he might end up deciding that he wanted to stay in Italy,” she says. “So he came with me under that set of circumstances.”Kelly goes on to explain that she and Jess, who have three children, stayed close after their split, and continued to work together.“We still dabbled in a lot of stuff together and sometimes traveled together to deliver things and so on,” she adds.In July 2020, the pair flew to Italy with two greyhounds, Vonny and Gooee, in tow.Although Jess, who’d never traveled to Italy before then, only intended to stay for a short time, he became “besotted” with the property, which was rebuilt by an Italian family named the Menichellis in 1901, when he and Kelly went to view it the following month.After negotiating with the owners, they agreed to buy Palazzo Menichelli for €123,000 ($132,700).“We just went to the agent’s office, went through all the documentation and signed it that night,” says Kelly.Once the sale was finalized later that year, the pair, who entered Italy with a Elective Residency Visa, a long-stay permit for non-EU citizens who intend to take residence in Italy, which requires a passive income of €31,000 (about $33,600,) spent the next few weeks getting to know the area and making plans.“There was always the proviso that we could cast his [Jess’s] name off the contract if he ever changed his mind,” Kelly explains. “I looked into it, and it was relatively straightforward.”They quickly set about beginning the renovation work on the historic property, which measures around 500 square meters (5,400 sq ft) and has a rooftop terrace that stretches across entire top floor.“The place was in such fundamentally good condition, which was kind of amazing because it was so cheap,” says Kelly.Kelly and Jess went on to complete most of the work themselves over the next three years, transforming a huge empty space into a functioning kitchen, giving the bathrooms a facelift and painting the huge property’s many walls.According to Jess, one of the hardest jobs was building a garden “from scratch” and creating a landscaped space.“That garden has been quite a challenge, because it was ‘crazy paving,’ which is random pieces of stone,” he says. “And there was absolutely no earth.”Once Kelly and Jess began working on the interior of the property, they discovered many more frescoes that were painted over and have been painstakingly removing the paint in order to restore them.“The removing of the paint over the frescoes is a long-term project,” explains Kelly, acknowledging that some areas may be “unfeasible to do.”“We’ll keep persisting with that.”Aside from this, they have pretty much completed the work on the six-level, 17-room property, which had four bedrooms, two dining rooms, two kitchens, four bathrooms and two entrances – one formal entrance and one side entrance.“It’s big, but it’s not crazy big,” says Kelly. “You hear about some palazzos over here that have 20 bedrooms.”They’ve converted one of the bedrooms into a salon/music room, where they plan to hold small concerts for family and friends and have also purchased and restored a Venetian harpsichord – a keyboard instrument that became popular during the Baroque period.Kelly and Jess have also created two new dining areas that open out onto the rear terrace.They eventually plan to transform two of the bedrooms on the second level into luxury B&B suites, and a separate section into a restaurant.Although they’ve put a lot of work into the property, Kelly and Jess feel incredibly lucky, as the process has been “so darn easy.”“So many movies have been about this hard slog renovating a place, and getting this arranged and that arranged,” says Kelly, explaining that the property didn’t require any structural, plumbing or electrical work.“And we just do it all ourselves. All we’ve got to do is the fun stuff.”They estimate that they’ve spent less than €50,000 (around $54,000) on materials, such as paint, so far.While Jess had only planned to stay in Italy for a short time, he’s taken to the country immensely and feels settled in Stimigliano, which is located just an hour from Rome.“Everyone’s been extremely friendly and helpful,” says Jess. “It’s a really great community.”However, the pair admit that they’ve found learning Italian and communicating with the locals to be hugely challenging.“I’m quite shy,” says Kelly. “So I sort of feel embarrassed. I beat myself up a lot, because I don’t understand as much of what the locals are saying.”And while Jess has been picking words up along the way and can “sort of scrape by” at the supermarket, he’s far from fluent.Kelly concedes that they haven’t been able to socialize with locals as much as they would have liked, partly due to the language barrier, as well as the fact that they arrived during the pandemic and spend much of their time working on the property.“I’d be lying if I told you that we go to lots of get togethers with locals and we all go around to each other’s houses,” she says. “That hasn’t really happened very much.“But we do go to all of the local events. And the wonderful thing about little Italian towns is that there’s constantly events going on.”Kelly’s been hugely impressed by the warmth and kindness of the local community, describing how their neighbors will sometimes ”turn up at our door and give us a lasagna,” because they often “make dozens and hand them to friends.”“Things like that blow me away,” she says, adding that Jess often finds himself being handed a free coffee or bottle of wine while out and about.Kelly loves the slower pace of life in the Italian town and admits that she sometimes felt like a “duck out of water” while living Down Under.“I was a terrible fit for Australia,” says Kelly, who was based just outside of the city of Melbourne before moving to Italy.“Australia is kind of painted as this place where it’s a very chill life. In reality, it’s very ‘rush.’“You’re always kind of working for something. Whereas here, you’re in this tiny little town and everybody sort of knows each other.“And if you’re walking past, everybody says ‘hello’ and they just give each other a helping hand.“It’s like something out of a fairytale book. It really is.”While she notes that some expats living in the country take exception to Italian bureaucracy, Kelly refuses to let it get to her.“People complain about the bureaucracy,” she says. “But what I point out is, we spend a tiny fraction of our time each year dealing with bureaucracy and 99% of our time just living this beautiful life in this beautiful place.”Their four-legged companion Vonny has also adapted to his new home well. Sadly Kelly’s dog Gooee, who also traveled to Italy with them, passed away last March.Although she and Jess are very happy with their setup, Kelly admits that their platonic relationship can cause confusion, particularly when meeting strangers.“I guess we’ve got better at dealing with it,” she says, stressing how well they’ve always worked together as a team.“But I’m 60 and Jess is now 62. Pardon my bluntness, but at our age a lot of people aren’t doing much anyway. So we’re kind of like a lot of married couples would be at this point.“Unless somebody specifically points out otherwise, it’s not something that we really think about.”While she’d talked of moving to Italy for many years, Kelly says that many of her friends back home didn’t take her seriously, and even her family question it at times.“Everybody said, ‘No, it won’t happen.’” she says. “But once I sold my house, they knew that I was definitely coming over here.”Kelly stresses that their children are thrilled by the way that things have worked out for she and Jess and their son is planning to come over to visit at some point this year.“He would be on the next plane to get here if he could,” she says, before explaining that their two daughters are less enthusiastic about making the long trip from Australia to Italy.Kelly points out that she’s seen a number of expats return to their home country after moving to Italy, with one of the main reasons being the aforementioned bureaucracy.She goes on to explain that the fact that most expats from outside the EU can only use their driving license for a year before having to obtain an Italian driving license, which involves taking the Italian driving test, is another factor.“Things like that, people kind of dwell on,” she says. “And they end up being the reasons that they go back.“What I would say to people is, ‘Just don’t worry about that.’ It’s such a little part of your life.“Some people adore life here and some people end up literally hating it because they focus on those two things.”Thankfully, both she and Jess are focused on little else but completing the work on their treasured palazzo, and making the most of their new life in Italy, a place that Kelly had fantasized about for so long.“It’s hard to imagine anywhere else being home other than this place for either of us anymore,” she adds."

        "title": "Airplane safety has hit a new record. But these ‘critical phase’ challenges are still a problem",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "This year hasn’t started well for aviation safety, with a runway collision at Tokyo’s Haneda airport and a door plug blowing out mid-air from an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 in January, and with four more fatal accidents involving regional and business aircraft in the weeks since.However, commercial airplanes remain the safest form of travel and a new report released February 28 confirms that 2023 was, by several measures, the safest year ever for flying.Now in its 60th year, the IATA Annual Safety Report - compiled by the International Air Transport Association - has been tracking the evolution of commercial aviation safety since 1964.Its data recorded 37 million flights in 2023 (both jet and turboprop), an increase of 17% on the year before. But despite this, 2023 had the lowest fatality risk and “all accident” rate on record. “At this level of safety, on average a person would have to travel by air every day for 103,239 years to experience a fatal accident,” says the IATA report.There were no fatal accidents or hull losses involving passenger jet aircraft last year, but the tragedy of Yeti Airlines Flight 691, a turboprop plane that crashed in Nepal in January with the loss of 72 lives, confirms that we can never take safety for granted. The industry must always strive to improve. “This is what we have done throughout our history. And we will continue to make flying ever safer,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.The 2023 “all accident” rate was better than the year before in all regions except North America and Asia Pacific. There were a number of close calls on US runways in 2023, with seven runway incursions – when planes get in the way of one another on the runway – recorded by mid-March alone.Europe has maintained a fatality risk of zero since 2018. However, the biggest chunk of the non-fatal airplane incidents in the region were related to landing gear collapse. Says the IATA: “Challenges persist in the critical phases of flight, especially during landing and take-off, with over half of all accidents occurring during 2014-2023 occurring during these phases.”Africa had the highest accident rate with 6.38 accidents per million sectors in 2023, although that’s improving on the year before and there haven’t been any fatal accidents in the region since 2020.North Asia was the safest region in the world. Its accident rate dropped from 0.45 accidents per million sectors down to 0.00 in 2023, while the fatality risk dropped from 0.23 in 2022 in 0.00 in 2023.The collision at Tokyo Haneda in January 2024 will impact North Asia’s safety performance for this year, although the Japan Airlines crew were praised for their excellent execution of safety protocol, which prevented this particular disaster turning into a much greater tragedy."

        "text": "You’ll no doubt be hungry after watching “Eva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.”Every episode is full of mouthwatering regional specialties prepared by chefs all over the country.For those wanting to follow in Eva Longoria’s footsteps, below is a guide to the restaurants and locations she visited.Longoria visits the coastal state of Veracuz. Its position along some 400 miles (645 kilometers) of the Caribbean Sea made it a focal point for military conflict – and the collision of food cultures. “The people of Veracruz took this treasure trove of ingredients passing in and out of the port and created a whole new cuisine,” Longoria said.• Longoria met chef Erik Guerrero, who aims to make fishing more sustainable in Veracruz, at Namik restaurant, where they enjoyed ceviche with hot beans and soft shell crab taco.• Next up, she joined actor and friend Ana de la Reguera for some coffee at historic Café La Parroquia, Veracruz Port. Tap on the glass three times to ring for milk.• She headed to the lush inland mountains to meet coffee farming expert Itzel Mendoza at Cafetal Privado en Coetzala to learn how the precious bean is grown. There, they gathered flowers in the fields to be added to chicken stew, a salsa and a palm flower fritter.• Back in Veracruz Port, she met food historian Nidia Hernández Medel at Chuchumbé, a cultural center, to cook some fried yucca, which is traced back to the city’s African slave era.• It’s back out of the city to meet with vanilla farmer Norma Gaya, of Gaya Vanilla and Spices, for some vanilla chicken.• At El Tajin ruins, a Totonac settlement, Longoria met cook Doña Marta.

Longoria called it a magnificently complex and sophisticated sauce.• At Las Quince Letras, chef Celia Florián made Longoria quesillo – a stretched Oaxacan cheese -- with crickets and edible flowers.• In the area of Oaxaca located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, several muxes, who identify as a third gender and are guardians of Zapotecan cuisine, cooked up stuffed pork with pineapple served alongside pureed potatoes. Longoria called it “the perfect combination.”• The farming town of Santa Ana Zegache is the unassuming epicenter of corn. Corn has been worshipped for over 6,000 years and is still the beating heart of Mexican cuisine.• In San Baltazar Chichicapam, Longoria visited a palenque (agave farm) run by Doña Berta, one of very few female mezcaleras. The farm produces mezcal, the smoky liquor for which this region is famed.• La Cocina de Humo is a hip restaurant using local ingredients. Chef Thalia Barrios García is known for her heirloom tomato salad with beet puree and herbal dressing. Longoria said it’s the “perfect dish.” Here’s the recipe.Mayan DNA runs through the recipes in Yucatán, which has the largest Maya population in Mexico.The state is located along the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by dense forests that isolate it off from the rest of the country. The Maya thrived here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The region’s geography and turbulent history have had a significant impact on the cuisine.• Ixi’im mixes modern and ancestral techniques and flavors.

        "title": "18 of the world’s best metro systems",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Crowded, hot, noisy, hectic – subway systems can test the sanity of even the most hardened urbanite, but can you imagine the world’s biggest cities without them? And as millions more of us flock to live in cities every year, efficient mass transit is going to become ever more critical to urban life.Subways – more commonly known as metros outside North America – are as varied as the cities they serve. They encompass everything from claustrophobic Victorian “tube” tunnels cut by hand to elegant turn-of-the-century steel viaducts and hyper-modern subterranean cathedrals served by fully automatic trains.What links them all is their incredible engineering and the role they play in the lives of people and cities. Here are a few of our favorites.The first and still one of the greatest of the world’s metro networks, London’s first subterranean railway line opened in January 1863 – with steam trains running below the streets between Paddington and Farringdon – and the system has since expanded to serve 272 stations on a 250-mile (400-kilometer) network with 11 lines.More than four million Londoners and visitors use the “Tube” every day, but despite the name more of the system lies above ground (55%) than beneath it. Branches extend far out into the surrounding counties of Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire.Far more than a transit system, London Underground is a global cultural icon (copies of its red, white and blue roundels can be found all over the world) and has been a world leader in transport architecture and design for more than a century.Without it, London’s development into one of the world’s great cities would have been impossible.Despite opening more than a century after London’s first Underground line, China’s Beijing Metro has grown rapidly to become one of the world’s longest and busiest systems.Opened in 1971, it now comprises 27 lines - including one Maglev route - extending for 519 miles across the Chinese capital and surrounding districts with 490 stations handling more than 10 million trips per day before the Covid-19 pandemic (3.84 billion trips in 2018).Six of the lines are fully automated with driverless trains. Ridership is recovering strongly and, in common with many other Chinese transit systems, it is struggling to meet the demands of a growing city.Beijing plans to extend its system to more than 620 miles and around 18.5 million trips a day by 2025. In response to chronic traffic congestion, the city is aiming for 60% of trips to be by public transit by 2025 – of those, 62% will involve the metro.Fares start at just $0.40 for a trip of up to four miles, although kids up to 1.3-meters (4 foot 3 inches) tall, over-65s, police and army veterans, military personnel and disabled citizens travel free. Little wonder the trains are so well used!It may not be the oldest, the longest or the busiest, but the Danish capital’s automatic Metro trains run 24 hours a day, seven days a week linking 39 spotlessly clean and stylish stations.Voted the “world’s best metro” on several occasions by international metro rail professionals, it has carried more than a billion passengers since the first section opened in 2002.As you’d expect from a city which prides itself as the home of cool Scandi design, the system exudes a simple, functional but compelling design philosophy and a calming environment quite unlike older and larger Metro systems elsewhere.Today, more than 300,000 people a day use the “M” trains on four lines which connect seamlessly with Copenhagen’s bike hubs, buses and overground trains.Although the trains are short by international standards, they’re incredibly frequent, running every two minutes for most of the day. While there may not be a real driver, kids of all ages can use their imagination to “drive” the trains if they’re lucky enough to bag the front seats!With 308 stations on 16 lines packed mostly within the city limits, the Paris Métropolitain – or Métro for short – has been delivering some of the most iconic cityscapes in the world since 1900.Whether it’s crossing the Seine on the Bir Hakeim Bridge close to the Eiffel Tower or rattling between the rooftops on early 20th century steel structures, the elevated sections of Lines 1, 2, 5 and 6 are the place to head for fleeting glimpses of the city going about its daily life.Like London’s Underground, the Paris Métro is part of the city’s cultural fabric, linking world-famous landmarks, museums and art galleries.Hector Guimard’s iconic art nouveau entrance canopies are known around the world, but the architectural interest doesn’t stop there. Subterranean stations such as the Jules Verne steampunk-esque Arts-et-Metiers on Line 11, Line 4’s stylish Cité or the brutalist tropical garden at Gare de Lyon on Line 14 make an appealing contrast to the standard white-tiled tunnels.Paris is investing billions in new and upgraded automatic Métro lines to improve mobility, but older trains with classic manually-operated doors are still around to surprise and alarm first-time visitors as locals leap out while the wheels are still moving!What comes to mind when you think of Tokyo’s subway? More than likely it’s the white-gloved Oshiya – professional “pushers” employed to cram as many bodies as possible into already-packed metro trains.Efficient, dependable transit is critical in the world’s largest metropolitan area, which is home to more than 35 million people, around 14 million of whom live in the city itself.Tokyo’s city transit network is incredibly dense and complex with no fewer than 100 urban rail lines including, somewhat unusually, two separate subway systems – Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway. Together they have 13 lines and 286 stations serving many of the city’s best-known districts.Despite trains running up to 24 times per hour to precision timetables, many stations are said to operate at well over their intended capacity – some as much as 200% more than they were designed for.All of this can make using Tokyo’s subways an overwhelming experience for visitors, but great efforts have been made in recent years to reduce that stress by providing multi-lingual signage, colour-coding and numbering of stations. Regular travelers can even identify where they are by the unique jingles played over the PA systems at some stations!If losing your phone and Wi-Fi connection on the subway fills you with dread, you might want to head for the capital of South Korea to see what is possible.Befitting the high-tech outlook of this ultra-modern city, Seoul Metro users can continue phone calls and internet browsing uninterrupted while underground or watch TV on screens fitted throughout the trains.As if that wasn’t luxury enough, the climate-controlled trains even have heated seats to make traveling in winter a little more pleasant.Spotlessly clean, efficient, safe, reasonably priced and serving most areas of the city, many experts regard Seoul Metro as the world’s best subway.Since the opening of Line 1 in 1974, it has become a showcase for Korean technology, attracting urban transit planners from all over the world. The nine lines now make up one of the world’s largest metro networks, covering 500 miles (312 kilometers) and 288 stations and carrying almost seven million passengers per day.Another railway inextricably woven into the social, cultural and economic life of the city it serves is New York City’s world-famous Subway. Like the city itself, the NYC Subway never sleeps, operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.At 665 miles (1,070 kilometers) long, with 25 lines – known locally as “trains” - and 472 stations it is North America’s longest and busiest network by some distance and one of the world’s greatest metro operations.It carries more than 3.5 million passengers a day and is unusual in running “local” (making all stops) and “express” trains. It serves all five of the city’s boroughs – Manhattan, Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn, plus an isolated line on Staten Island.Despite its name, much of the NYC Subway runs above ground, often on heavily riveted steel bridges straddling roads, familiar from movies such as “The French Connection” and “Saturday Night Fever.”For even more Subway action, fans should check out the 1974 Walter Matthau movie “The Taking of Pelham 123” (not the 2009 remake), a brilliant fictional account of a subway train hijacking.When the first Subway line opened back in 1904, a ticket cost just five cents. It’s a little more expensive today at $2.90, but trips are still very reasonably priced by international standards and are usually the quickest and most cost-effective way to get around the Big Apple.Mexico City is notorious for its chronic traffic jams and choking pollution, but fortunately citizens and visitors have the option of escaping into an extensive and efficient rapid transit system that enjoys some of the cheapest fares in the world.Opened in 1969, the STC Metro is now the second largest in North America – after New York City – and has 12 lines, 195 stations (115 underground) and more than 140 miles (225 kilometers) of tracks.Instead of conventional steel wheels on steel rails, it employs a similar system to many Paris Métro lines with rubber tyres on steel wheels, offering a smoother and quieter ride on Mexico City’s unstable and earthquake-prone terrain.This decision proved to be a wise one after the system survived a 1985 earthquake intact.In one of the world’s most populous cities, where rich and poor often lead very separate existences, the STC Metro brings together diverse social classes in a shared space to avoid the congestion, noise and pollution in the streets above. And, with a flat fare of just five pesos (around $0.25c) per trip, there’s no cheaper or quicker way to get around this vast metropolis.Many of Asia’s great cities have benefited from lessons learned by the early subway builders in Europe and North America. Instead of tiny tunnels and cramped, stuffy trains, commuters in cities such as Singapore enjoy larger profile trains and spacious stations acting as vibrant community hubs.Despite only opening in 1987, Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) is southeast Asia’s oldest metro network – as well as its busiest. High land values in the densely packed city state also made it the world’s most expensive metro to build, with construction costs reaching $111.5 billion by 2021.Much of the 140-mile (225 kilometer), six-line, fully-automatic network is elevated, although some of the more recent sections are underground, with some stations designed to double as public air-raid shelters.Like the city it serves, MRT is famous for being spotlessly clean and efficient. To keep it that way, smoking, drinking and eating are banned at stations and on trains – and that includes the famously stinky durian fruit, a favourite of many locals!Home to more than 3.7 million people, Germany’s capital enjoys one of the densest urban transit and best integrated networks in the world. The 120 years since the opening of its first U-Bahn (subway) line have also been uniquely turbulent, seeing Berlin at the epicenter of World War II and the Cold War.First opened in 1902, Berlin’s earliest U-Bahn lines are of similar vintage to those in Paris and New York City and share many characteristics. Bright yellow trains rattle above suburban streets on vintage steel viaducts before diving into small-profile tunnels under the city center. Crossing the iconic Oberbaum Bridge on Line U1 – the oldest part of the network – is an unmissable Berlin experience.Today, the U-Bahn network consists of nine lines and 174 stations – 90% of which are underground - carrying more than 1.5 million passengers a day.Complementing the U-Bahn are the classic red and cream S-Bahn trains, providing faster journeys for longer hops across the city.The 16 S-Bahn routes are Berlin’s major arteries, connecting its most important locations with its wider region. Best known is the elevated Stadtbahn, which has provided an unbeatable sightseeing tour through the city’s best-known sights since the mid-1920s, from Zoologischer Garten in the west via the Tiergarten park and Berlin Hauptbahnhof (main station) to Alexanderplatz, home of the Communism-era Television Tower.S-Bahn and U-Bahn trains interchange with local buses and trams at well-organized hubs, providing a superb transit network that reaches every corner of this once-divided city.One of the greatest engineering feats of the Soviet Union was Moscow’s spectacular Metro network. Best known for its extraordinarily grand underground stations, ornately decorated to celebrate workers, peasants and soldiers, the network was designed to serve a dual function – protecting citizens from nuclear strikes as well as keeping them moving.While many newer stations and those away from the city center are less ornate, the best Moscow Metro stations have been, in less turbulent times, tourist attractions in their own right, inspired by Tsarist palaces.A further burst of construction in the 21st century has taken the network to 14 lines radiating from a city centre hub, plus the Koltsevaya (inner circle) and recently-completed 36-mile “Big Circle” line.Carrying more than 8 million Muscovites a day, the Metro is one of the world’s busiest and most extensive, with 269 miles (432 kilometers) of tracks and 258 stations.With just one circular line circumnavigating the city center, Glasgow’s Subway struggles to meet the criteria for a metro “system” but its age and quirky features make it deserving of wider recognition.Opened in 1896, it was the world’s third underground railway – after London and Budapest – and a statement of the Scottish city’s industrial and economic power. Two tiny tunnels running clockwise and counter-clockwise for just over six miles link the city center with communities south and north of the River Clyde that were once world-famous for shipbuilding and heavy engineering.Originally powered by cables, the unique 4-foot-gauge trains were converted to electric power in 1935 and closed for a complete rebuild to modern standards in 1977-79.The brightly coloured new trains earned the railway its “Clockwork Orange” nickname, although they are now painted white. New Swiss-built trains are now being introduced and the railway is about to move into its fourth era, which will see it move to fully automatic operation.If Beijing is China’s political center, then Shanghai is its vibrant creative, commercial and financial heart – and the biggest city in the world’s second-most populous country. Efficient mass transit has been critical to its incredible growth over the last 30 years.Opened in 1993, Shanghai Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) is expanding at a breakneck pace to become the world’s longest and busiest subway network. It currently has 19 lines serving 14 of the megacity’s 16 districts and a metropolitan area of almost 40 million people.Vying with Beijing for the title of the world’s longest and busiest metro network, Shanghai currently exceeds 500 miles, but further expansion should take it to 620 miles (about 1,000 kilometers) and 25 lines by 2025. By then, nowhere in central Shanghai will be more than 2,000 feet (600 meters) from a subway station.With 408 stations, it currently carries more than 10 million passengers per day but its one-day record is an incredible 13.3 million trips, set on March 8, 2019.In common with other subway systems built by the Soviet Union, the Kyiv Metro serves a dual purpose – a feature that continues to be essential as the city suffers regular Russian missile attacks. Spacious stations feature specialized ventilation and filtration equipment and huge metal blast doors that can be sealed above and below ground.Plans for an underground railway go back as far as 1884, but the first of Kyiv’s three metro lines did not open until November 1960 – the third Soviet city to gain a metro after Moscow and St Petersburg.Expansion continued after Ukraine’s independence in 1991, creating a three-line, 42-mile network which serves all 10 city districts.Since February 2022, Kyiv Metro’s civil protection function has come to the fore, with 47 of the 52 stations designated as public bomb shelters. At 346 feet below ground, Arsenalna station in the city center was famously the deepest in the world – taking five minutes to reach by escalator - until it was surpassed by a station on the Chongqing network in China.In the early days of the Russian invasion in March 2022 up to 40,000 residents reportedly sought refuge in metro stations and President Volodymyr Zelensky used metro stations to host international news conferences. Despite this, the network continues to operate, providing fast and frequent services around a city fighting to maintain an air of normality under the shadow of war.With cameos in numerous movies and TV shows including “The Blues Brothers,” “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and “ER” - Chicago’s “L” (short for “elevated”) rapid transit system is a world-famous symbol of the Windy City.Like many of the economic and industrial powerhouses of the late-19th and early 20th century – including New York, Paris, Hamburg and Liverpool – Chicago chose to run its new electric trains on steel viaducts elevated high above congested city streets. These quickly became one of the city’s defining features and a catalyst for economic growth in the dense downtown district.In 2005, Chicago Tribune readers voted the “L” as one of the seven wonders of Chicago.Although the “L is primarily associated with its city center “Loop”, opened in 1897 and featuring exceptionally tight curves between buildings, the network now extends to eight colour-coded lines, 145 stations and 103 miles (166 kilometers) of route, sections of which are at ground level, in tunnels or cuttings.Along with the New York City Subway and Copenhagen Metro, it is one of just three systems in the world running trains 24 hours a day. More than 100 million trips were made on the “L” in 2022 – around 320,000 per day - making it the second busiest transit system in the United States.Another relative newcomer to the mass transit scene, Indian capital New Delhi opened its first line in 2002. It was the second city in India after Kolkata to gain a metro but has since expanded rapidly to become the country’s largest and busiest network with more than two billion trips recorded in 2023.First mooted in the 1960s, the construction of a modern mass transit system became vital as Delhi’s population doubled between 1981 and 1998, creating intolerable congestion and air pollution.Now boasting 12 high-capacity lines with 288 stations across 250 miles (400 kilometers) of route, Delhi Metro is India’s biggest and busiest mass transit network. By mileage it is the world’s 12th longest system and the 16th busiest for ridership.Serving Delhi and the nearby cities of Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noiza and Ghadiabad, the Metro’s fast, modern and spacious trains have reportedly helped to reduce private car use and traffic accidents and drastically cut pollution.India’s Central Road Research Institute estimates that using the metro saves commuters an estimated 66 minutes per day compared to driving!Transit planners flock to Hong Kong from across the globe to discover how its Mass Transit Railway (MTR) delivers world-class service and reliability to the territory’s 7.4 million citizens.Densely populated city areas crowded around a deep natural harbour and towns scattered across dozens of islands and mountainous countryside, Hong Kong is not an easy place to build railways, but since 1975 MTR has established an enviable reputation for quality, efficiency and punctuality.It regularly achieves a 99.9% “on-time” rate – a figure most other railways across the world can only dream of. MTR’s funding model also draws widespread admiration; construction of new lines has opened up new areas of the region for development, helping to fund the expansion of the system. The model was inspired by Tokyo, but has its origins in London’s Metropolitan Railway, which created the iconic ‘Metro-Land’ outer suburbs from the early-20th century.Ten high-capacity lines link Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories, including the dedicated high-speed Airport Express link to Lantau Island and the Disneyland Resort Line.Despite the compact geography of the territory, MTR operates more than 150 miles of route and 99 stations, the latter being famously clean and spacious.MTR’s success at home has encouraged it to expand far beyond Hong Kong, managing projects and operations in mainland China, Sweden, Australia and the UK, where it holds the operating concession for London’s Elizabeth Line.Hungarian engineers were among the earliest pioneers of electric-powered technology in the late-19th century, not least in the field of railways.Although London opened the first underground railway (see above), it initially employed conventional steam trains. It fell to Budapest to build the world’s first electrified underground subway system.Line M1 was completed in 1896 and was a radical leap forward for urban mass transit, introducing electric lighting in stations and train cars, bi-directional cars and the first use of an overhead wire system - rather than a ground level contact rail - to supply electricity to the trains.Known as the “Small Underground,” M1 runs under Andrássy Avenue on the Pest side of the city from Andrássy Square to Városliget (City Park).Designed to carry city dwellers to the park without spoiling the elegant streetscape with tramcars and power lines, the line has seen many changes over the last 120 years but its tiny trains still carry around 80,000 riders a day as part of a wider four-line network expanded between 1970 and 2014."

        "title": "France’s favorite cheese is facing an ‘extinction’ crisis. Not everyone is worried",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "When Napoleon first encountered a Camembert cheese, legend has it, he was so delighted he kissed the waitress who plonked it in front of him. Setting aside the inappropriateness of this gesture, the French emperor clearly recognized a winner.Produced in France’s northwestern region of Normandy in various forms since at least the 18th century, the cheese - creamy, pungent and gooey - is now regarded as France’s favorite.Which is why recent headlines about Camembert’s imminent death due to a fungal crisis have caused panic among fans of this historic fromage. Scientists, it seems, have warned that problems with French cheese’s industrial production may have long-term consequences for its future.Alarm was raised in January when a recent study by scientists at Paris-Saclay University identified that the main fungus used in creating Camembert and other cheeses was increasingly in short supply due to the industrial production methods used to keep up with demand.And while that might spell trouble for a variety of dairy offerings, some have taken this to mean that poor Camembert – which is handily sold in its own wooden box – is headed for the grave.“Blue cheeses may be under threat, but the situation is much worse for Camembert, which is already on the verge of extinction,” the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) said in its report about the findings. Elsewhere, another headline warned of a looming “cheese crisis,” adding, “say a prayer for Camembert!”The cheese stakes couldn’t be higher. Alongside the Louvre, haute couture and the Eiffel Tower, Camembert is a national treasure beloved the world over – as existential to the French as existentialism.“What’s the typical image of France? A bottle of red wine, a baguette and a Camembert,” says Anne-Marie Cantin, a veteran cheesemonger and president judge of the 2023 French national Camembert competition. “It’s our national cheese.”At the heart of the problem is Penicillium camemberti, a fungus used in cheesemaking that gives Camembert its white rind and helps develop both the cheese’s rich buttery umami flavor and its palpable aroma of unwashed socks.P. camemberti is, say the Paris-Saclay scientists, experiencing problems reproducing, largely as a result of the pressures of industrial production. Not so much performance anxiety per se, but the consequence of an asexual fungal cultivation process that, due to an extreme lack of genetic diversity, is running on empty.Camembert, and similar cheeses like Brie, were once aged in caves or hâloirs (drying rooms), where naturally occurring mold spores gave them blue or sometimes yellow-brown rinds. At the turn of the last century, Penicillium camemberti was introduced, replacing the indigenous mold and creating the uniform white rinds we know today.“It is thought to be a white mutant selected from the gray-green species Penicillium commune for its color at the start of the 20th century,” the Paris-Saclay study said.Unfortunately, unlike its cave-dwelling fungal counterparts, researchers found that Penicillium camemberti has a very low genetic diversity and declined capacity to reproduce sexually.“Our findings raise questions about the use of limited number of clonal strains for cheese making, which tends to lead to degeneration, limiting the possibilities for further improvement,” the study said.That, according to the CNRS report, means “it is now very difficult for manufacturers to obtain sufficient quantities of P. camemberti spores to inoculate their Normandy cheese production.”It’s not the first time Camembert has faced a crisis following the introduction of P. camemberti. According to the late Patrick Lance, a British cheese expert who authored a definitive guide to France’s cheese, the industrialization and conflict of the last century almost saw it wiped out.“Two world wars and too much big business nearly brought Camembert to its grave, except in name,” he wrote in his definitive 1989 tome “The French Cheese Book.”“And this name has been brought into contempt by failure to protect it against the masses of pasteurised factory distortions of the formula, perpetrated over almost all of France and abroad.To the rescue, in 1982, came Appellation d’origine protégée (AOP) status, which meant only cheeses made in Normandy could carry the Camembert name. That didn’t, however, stop further tussles over whether true Camembert should be made with raw or pasteurized milk.Those who have experienced the past rises and falls of Camembert seem to be taking the cheese’s latest problem in their stride.“My family has been making Camembert since 1891, five generations… I have never heard of this situation before,” Bruno Lefèvre, director general of Les fromageries de Normandie, a regional cheesemakers’ association, told CNN.“It is true that cheesemakers have fought battles against the cheese that didn’t have a white appearance,” Lefèvre said, adding that the first batches of Camembert his father made, more than 50 years ago, were “blue, white and red.”But from his understanding, the color difference is a result of bacterial pigmentation.“It’s linked to this type of bacterium called Brevibacterium linens, which has the ability to form an orange pigment. It is by no means a result of fungus activity,” Lefèvre said.France is currently hosting its annual cheese fair in Paris, gathering major cheesemakers from across the country. Naturally, fading fungus has been a much-discussed topic. Lefèvre said that people he has spoken with were confused about where the fear for Camembert’s future was coming from.“I have made all kinds of Camembert, from more traditional ones to the more industrial ones, I have never encountered issues with my fungus,” Lefèvre said.“This study has been widely reported by the media. Maybe the researchers were trying to make us cheesemakers panic, but so far they have not succeeded,” he added.While the scientists have stood by their claims, they stress that there’s no danger that Camembert is vanishing anytime soon. “We always make it clear to journalists that there is no short-term danger to Camembert production,” researcher Tatiana Giraud told CNN. “What our articles say is that there is a great homogenization of starters and that this reduces their ability to adapt, nothing more.”Of course, keeping Camembert alive also means that the cheese’s story is also kept alive. Supposedly, it was first created by a Normandy woman called Marie Harel who picked up tips from a fugitive priest from Brie, another bastion of French cheesemaking. After finding favor with Napoleon, it went on to play an unexpected role in World War I, which was commemorated with a statue.The monument to Harel in the Normandy town of Vimoutiers, was actually first built by an American, according to Camembert expert Anne-Marie Cantin.“An American doctor first came to Normandy after the First World War asking to find the tomb of Marie Harel and later build a statue for her,” she said.“To the surprise of locals, who had struggled to find someone who can speak English, he explained that he had used Camembert during the war to cure patients and wanted to come and thank the inventor.”That statue was later destroyed in 1944 by American bombing during the Normandy landings and it was a group of cheese factory workers from Ohio who made a donation to build a new one after the war, according to Cantin.The statue is still standing proudly today in the town square of Vimoutiers in Normandy, with a plaque marking that it is a gift offered by “400 men and women making cheese in Van Wert, Ohio, USA.”Another statue of Marie Harel stands back in Van Wert County Museum in Ohio, quietly marking an extraordinary and cheesy relationship between France and the United States."

        "title": "New Florence airport terminal will have a vineyard on its roof",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "From the “Walkie Talkie” skyscraper in London, to the Carrasco International Airport in Uruguay, New York-based firm Rafael Viñoly Architects’ portfolio consists of hundreds of projects spanning five continents. The latest addition, announced in January, will be a new international terminal at the Aeroporto Amerigo Vespucci in Florence, the capital of the Italian region of Tuscany.The structure will serve “as a new landmark for the city’s sustainable future,” according to the firm, and as an homage to the region’s wine-producing heritage, it will have a vineyard on the roof.“The concept of the building is to recreate the most quintessential Tuscan landscape, which is the vineyard — and then to peel one end of the vineyard up from the floor to create a slope, and slide an airport underneath that slope,” says Román Viñoly, director of Rafael Viñoly Architects.Set to be completed in two phases, anticipated for 2026 and 2035, Viñoly says sustainability is at the heart of the new structure, calling it a “moral responsibility of anybody building anything.”The construction sector and the built environment are responsible for 40% of global energy-related carbon emissions. Meanwhile about 2.5% of all emissions is produced by commercial aviation. Efforts to reduce this impact have often focused on innovations in plane fuel, including fuel made from cooking oil, and even sewage, but this new project turns the attention to the operation and construction of the airport itself.The design’s main attraction, a 19-acre vineyard, acts as a sloping green roof, which research shows can have environmental benefits, such as helping to insulate the building. Along with the sloped design, the roof will have other features engineered for energy efficiency.“The roof doesn’t start right at the bottom where it meets the floor,” says Viñoly. “The first third of the length of the building is a berm [mound] made of soil and earth.”He explains that heat exchanger coils will be used to move heat from the berm into the building and vice versa, depending on the season.“In the summer, when you need to cool the interior of the space, you do heat exchange into that mass of earth,” he says. “It holds that temperature very effectively for a very long time such that when winter comes and you need to warm the interior, you can do heat exchange again and pull the heat out of that soil and put it into the terminal.”Woven through the structure, including between the vine rows, will sit a combination of solar panels and translucent photovoltaic panels, which Viñoly says are important to reduce energy usage throughout the day, and create a “visual contact” between passengers inside the building and the vineyard.When passengers look up, however, they will not be able to see any fruit. According to Viñoly, due to a risk of foreign object damage to aircraft engines, the roof will be primarily covered with non-fruit-bearing rootstock vineyards. Instead, the fruit will be grown and cultivated on the soil bed of the berm — a decision that wasn’t taken lightly.“We’ve done a fair amount of research and consultation with winemakers and agricultural engineers,” says Viñoly. “The building is close to 500 meters away from where the nearest airplane is. So, because of the physical separation, we are confident that the potential pollutants that might be around the aircraft are far enough away that they won’t have an impact on the quality of the wine produced.”As for where the wine from the vineyard will be crafted — and by who — it remains to be seen. According to Viñoly, there are provisions in the design to produce a winery under the roof, though this is not confirmed. Meanwhile, the winemaker is yet to be chosen by the airport.The project will be cutting edge in its sustainable features, believes Filippo Weber, a member of the non-profit Italian Climate Network, and founder of Italian sustainable architecture firm Weber Architects, who is unrelated to the project. But he questions whether too much emphasis has been placed on the look of the vineyard, rather than its sustainable benefits.Apart from the vineyard’s possible high demand for water, Weber says, “vines are not green all year round, and this reduces their potential for carbon offsetting the embodied energy and energy consumption of the building.”In terms of the photovoltaic panels, Weber adds that those placed between the vine rows might be not sufficient in terms of surface area, and that there is a risk they will be overshadowed by the vines themselves.While Weber calls the use of a berm as a heat exchanger an “interesting strategy,” he says there is not enough information to evaluate its effectiveness, and that “doubts could be raised that such a shallow layer of soil will be able to store enough energy to exchange heat with such an energy-consuming building.”Ultimately, greener airports will not make a sizable impact on reducing aviation emissions. The more important, and urgent need is to reduce emissions from airlines themselves. And while airlines across the globe have pledged to hit net-zero on greenhouse gases by 2050, the industry is not yet on track to reach this target.However, Viñoly hopes the project will encourage airports around the world to take sustainability more seriously, and to recognize “that [airports] are not simply transitional places, but they are also destinations in and of themselves.”"

        "title": "This train goes nowhere. Now it’s a luxury attraction",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "South Africa is home to some of the most luxurious, nostalgic train journeys on offer anywhere in the world. But for certain enthusiasts, a train going nowhere is the country’s star attraction.Kruger Shalati: The Train on the Bridge is a hotel in Skukuza in Kruger National Park, one of Africa’s largest game reserves and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Comprising a set of train carriages renovated into 24 modern suites with balconies and a pool overlooking the Sabie River, it marries luxury accommodation with an intimate view of wildlife, including sightings of Africa’s “Big Five” — lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalos.Jerry Mabena, CEO of Motsamayi Tourism Group, which owns the hotel, says the venture harks back to the earliest days of the park, when steam trains would pass through Kruger in the 1920s on the Selati Railway Line.Trains were once vital for tourists accessing Kruger, and would even park overnight on the same bridge where the hotel sits today. A new railway line built on the edge of Kruger in the 1970s pushed the Selati line and bridge into retirement, but in 2016 an idea was formed to restore the bridge to its former glory.“The idea for us was to re-enact the experience in some form or another,” Mabena says. “When we had the opportunity to buy mothballed old carriages from Transnet — which is our rail logistics operator in South Africa — we couldn’t say no to the idea.”The carriages’ interiors have been renovated with a modern finish, albeit with a few Art Deco flourishes (“we were trying to find a look that is non-colonial,” says Mabena).If guests leave their curtains open, they can wake with the dawn and catch the first signs of life outside from east-facing floor-to-ceiling windows. The river is a wildlife focal point, meaning guests can spend all day lounging on balconies or swimming in the pool while checking out activity below. “Having hippos grunting underneath the carriage attracts people who want to be in the wild but don’t want to be immersed in the wild,” says Mabena.Nevertheless, many visitors strap on boots and head into the bush with a guide on a game drive.Staff including senior guide Thuli Mnisi were recruited as part of efforts to involve the local community in the enterprise. Mnisi had worked as a guide for other companies since 2014 before joining Kruger Shalati. “(It’s) totally different from other lodges,” she says. “When (guests) visit the train for the first time, it’s breath-taking, the view is unique.”Kruger National Park allows self-driving safari experiences, but Mnisi says there’s no substitute for having a guide. “We communicate with one another, we know where we can find the animals,” she says.“If you’re (on) a self-drive, you can just wander around Kruger National Park, and it’s a very big area. If you go with a guide, they know what they’re doing, they know where to find what and exactly at what time.”Gardeners have planted indigenous species on the hotel grounds and nurture a kitchen garden, with produce used in Kruger Shalati’s fine dining restaurant. Local delicacies served in the refined setting include crocodile, venison, and springbok carpaccio.“Mother nature is the true artist,” says chef Vusi Mbatha. “It’s one of those philosophies that we share: take simple ingredients and transform them into something amazing.”After development delays courtesy of Covid-19, the hotel opened in December 2020 and is welcoming guests for its fourth summer season.Double and twin rooms aboard the train start at 9,950 Rand ($530) per person, per night for international guests, with discounts for longer stays. One of the seven rooms in the adjacent Bridge House cost less. Rates include all meals, certain drinks, two game drives and airport transfers.If all this sounds like too much wildlife and not enough trains, Motsamayi Tourism Group also owns Kruger Station, just south of the bridge and home to the last train to operate in the park.Stranded after most of the tracks in the park were removed in the 1970s, the South African Railway Class 24 steam locomotive has lived many lives (including a funeral coach for a former prime minister) and now enjoys a happy retirement alongside a restaurant and bar.“The culture of steam trains and the culture of historical trains I think is beginning to re-emerge,” says Mabena.“We don’t have a moving steam train, but one day, I think we will.”"

        "text": "Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar, alone.“I’ll go for one song and suss it out,” she thought, trying to quieten her nerves.Kacie slipped in at the back. The club was dark and busy, a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking, dancing and chatting. Before she could even take in the musicians on stage, Kacie’s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar.“I walked in and he was there,” Kacie tells CNN Travel today. “We clocked eyes.”“Ciao,” said the stranger, smiling.“Ciao,” Kacie said back, before adding apologetically: “That’s all the Italian I’ve got for you.”It was October 2018. Kacie was a 24-year-old New Yorker on vacation in Florence. It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo. It was an exciting – and terrifying – experience.“I was a professional dancer in New York,” explains Kacie. “A very exhausting career – there’s a lot of toxicity, a lot of rejection, there’s a lot of politics that come into play – and I was feeling a little stuck, a little unhappy, a little – just stagnant, if you will.”Kacie spent her days auditioning, traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store. She needed a break, and she’d long felt a “pull” to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation.“I kept saying, ‘I’ll wait for somebody to go with, I’ll wait, I’ll wait. And then I was waiting for years. And so then one night – at two in the morning – I was like, ‘What am I waiting for? Life is too short.’ So I booked a solo trip to Italy.”Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence. But in the lead-up to the trip, she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at. This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city’s praises, persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint.And that’s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening.“I’m really glad that I listened to her,” says Kacie. “That’s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence, on that earlier day that I wasn’t originally supposed to be there.”The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was 26-year-old Dario Nencetti, a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights. It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week.The jazz bar, called Jazz Club Firenze, was one of Dario’s favorite hangouts. He loved the music, the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions.“That place is, let’s say, unconventional for Florence,” Dario tells CNN Travel. “Usually in Florence, there’s like a table for two or three or four people. In the jazz club, there are big tables, so you can sit with strangers and stuff, which I love.”When Dario realized Kacie didn’t know much Italian beyond “ciao,” they switched to English. Dario told Kacie he’d lived in Scotland for a year, and they got talking about travel. Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he’d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year.“We bonded from the beginning,” says Dario. “It was really natural, really easy conversation.”“I remember he made me laugh,” says Kacie. “And I was like, ‘Oh, this guy’s interesting.” So many people ask us, ‘How did you know?’ And I don’t know how I knew. I was just like, ‘Oh, this is something different.’”Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning. Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days.“He would meet me after his work – every night he got off at 11. And we would go out and we would just talk,” recalls Kacie. “I instantly fell in love with Florence. It’s a very romantic city - cobblestone streets and medieval buildings. It looks like a painting everywhere you look.”It was a whirlwind two days. One evening they sat by Florence’s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until 3 or 4 a.m. It was as though Kacie was in a film – somewhere between every millennial’s favorite “The Lizzie McGuire Movie” and classic Florentine romance “A Room with a View.”Then, the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip. It was still like something from a movie – only it wasn’t obvious this one had a happy ending.“I got on the train and he was standing on the platform. And I remember looking out the train, and I was so sad,” she says.As the train pulled away from the station, Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York.“I just met my future husband in Florence,” she wrote. “That’s the guy I’m gonna marry. I’m never gonna see him again.”Her friend tried to cheer her up.“You’re going to Rome,” she wrote. “You’ll meet a gladiator!”But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn’t replaceable.“We never stopped talking. We FaceTimed every single day,” she says.This continued when Kacie was back in the US. And before long, Dario was planning a trip to visit New York.On December 8, 2018 Dario arrived in the US. Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York.“It was really cool to see it through his eyes,” she says.“She showed me the real city,” says Dario.Then the couple flew to Miami for a week’s vacation.For Kacie and Dario, there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship.“It was never a decision to be made,” says Kacie.“It just went without saying,” agrees Dario. “But I can’t hide it, long distance was hard.”The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime, but tried to visit each other whenever they could.Cut to September 2019. Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie.“Why don’t I move here?” he suggested. He’d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get-go and could see himself there. The restaurant scene was incredible. If he could find a job and organize the visa, it seemed like the ideal scenario.Kacie thought so too, so Dario started asking around. He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. After a couple of months in limbo, his visa was approved.“Up until that point, every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic – we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other,” says Kacie. “Saying goodbye in airports sucked. It would take like a week to recover.”But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past.“It was really exciting,” says Dario.Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together, giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city.Then the pandemic hit. New York City’s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt. Stuck at home, Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another.As Kacie puts it, she and Dario found “many silver linings” in this tough time. Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta. They cat-sat. They spent long evenings chatting.But as 2020 rolled on, the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them. Dario’s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic, renewal was out of the question.For Kacie and Dario, it seemed like there were only three viable choices: return to long distance, get married or move to Italy.Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes, the last thing either of them wanted. And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future, they didn’t feel it was right for them at that point. That left moving to Italy.Kacie thought about her career in New York. Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight. And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing, Kacie only felt “relief” that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty.“That was a pretty big wake-up call,” she says. “I had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing.”On top of this, Kacie’s New York apartment lease was up. If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy, it was now.“Everything kind of fell into place,” she says.Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas. She applied, enrolling in Italian lessons. Then, Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic.Before stepping on the plane in January 2021, Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy. She’d never posted much on the platform before, but felt inspired to mark this significant life step.When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi-Fi, her cell phone was blowing up.“It went viral,” says Kacie.While stuck inside during mandatory two-week quarantine, Kacie continued posting TikTok videos. Her following continued to grow.While her social media presence was getting bigger, for the first few months in Florence, Kacie and Dario’s IRL world remained small. Italy was still in the thrall of Covid, with strict restrictions.But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work, Florence started to slowly reopen.“I remember the first time going to the Duomo. And there was nobody there,” says Kacie. “Which is crazy, because it’s like the main focus point of Florence. And there’s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was.”While that moment was surreal – even sad – Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together. They’d come a long way, and they were excited for their new life together in Italy.Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario’s family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly – even if, in the early days, Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario’s mother didn’t know much English.The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones.“They bonded immediately,” says Dario.Kacie continued to post on social media, and her following ballooned. After about six months, she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time.Dario encouraged this step.“I think it was a really good idea diving into it,” he says today. “It was the right moment, the right time, and I believed in her from the first moment.”Almost four years later, Kacie’s expanded her social media presence into a travel company, running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides. Meanwhile, Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant.“I really love the life we’ve created here,” says Kacie. “We live in a beautiful place with great food and he’s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me.”The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors, but they also savor their downtime. They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together.Dario and Kacie are settled in Florence for now, although they don’t rule out a move elsewhere in the future.“We’re enjoying the moment,” says Dario.“The solid thing is the fact that we know we’re in it together. And that’s what makes it so great,” says Kacie.She tells Dario: “I’m not nervous for what the future holds. Because I’ve got you.”Looking back, Kacie finds it serendipitous and surreal to think her spontaneous decision to travel solo in Italy led her to find a new career, a new home and the love of her life.“There were so many things that had to happen for it to actually happen, but it just felt normal and natural – like of course this is right and this was supposed to happen,” she says.“You never really know what life has planned for you. There’s so many good things waiting. You just have to trust it,” adds Kacie. “Trust in the process. And the path that is meant for you will happen, even if it’s not the path that you intended to take for yourself.”"

        "title": "They fell in love three decades ago. Now they pilot planes together",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "On their first flight together, Joel Atkinson and Shelley Atkinson couldn’t contain their excitement. They enthused to the flight attendants. They posed for photos. They told passengers via a pre-flight announcement.“We made a big deal about it,” Joel tells CNN Travel.Then, right before take off, Joel and Shelley sat side by side in the flight deck, just the two of them. They’d come full circle, and were about to embark on an exciting new chapter.“It felt amazing,” Shelley tells CNN Travel.“As we prepared to take off, I was giddy, euphoric,” says Joel.Joel and Shelley met as twentysomethings flying jets in the US Air Force. They became fast friends, then, over time, fell in love.Today, they’ve been married for 27 years and counting. They’ve brought up two kids together. And now they’re both pilots for Southwest Airlines. They regularly fly together, with Joel as captain and Shelley as first officer.The couple say working together is “amazing.” They treat layovers as “date nights.” They learn from one another’s respective “wisdom and judgment.”And no, they don’t argue mid-flight.“People ask us, how does it work, flying together?” says Joel. “We know a few pilot couples and some of them fly together, some of them don’t. I’ve heard people say, ‘Oh I could never fly with my wife or my husband.’”For Joel and Shelley, working together is seamless – a joy that comes easily to them both.“We’re best friends,” says Shelley.“There’s just that unspoken bond,” says Joel.Shelley grew up in Iowa and moved to Colorado – Joel’s home state – as a teenager. The two spent their high school years unaware of one another, but they graduated the same year, and both opted to study at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado in the late 1980s.Joel says he was very influenced by the 1985 Tom Cruise movie “Top Gun” – “which made flying jets look like a lot of fun.” For Shelley, who was an athlete, the appeal of the Air Force Academy was less about flying – which she only really discovered once she was enrolled – and more an opportunity to play college basketball.“I didn’t attend the Academy to pursue flying, initially. Once I was there I realized it was a great opportunity for a fun and challenging career,” she says. “And the introduction to flying there made me want to pursue it further.”Joel and Shelley spent four years studying at the Air Force Academy without actually crossing paths, although Joel was vaguely aware of Shelley.“There’s not that many women at the Air Force Academy, so I kind of knew who she was,” he says.The two finally met a few years later, after they’d both completed pilot training in different states. They got the same first assignment – flying Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in Texas.When Shelley arrived in Texas, Joel had been there for a few months.“So I was there, kind of established, and she came into the office where I was working,” he recalls. “She came in and turned in the paperwork, and we said, ‘Hi,’ just exchanged some pleasantries.”Joel was struck by Shelley right away.“She’s tall. She looks great. She left the room and this other coworker was just looking at me smiling. And I said, ‘What?’ And he could tell.”Looking back, Joel thinks it was the “eye contact” he had with Shelley that gave his feelings away. Or maybe just “the look on my face.”“There was something there,” says Joel, smiling. “But I just kind of laughed it off. I was like, ‘Nah, we’re just going to be friends.’”Joel was also a bit intimidated by Shelley – he was “attracted to her right away,” but didn’t know if she’d ever be interested in him.“She’s taller than me. And I had never dated anyone taller than me,” he says. “She’s an athlete, she’s a natural leader, and just an impressive person.”But Joel’s warm nature appealed to Shelley. She felt comfortable around him right away. They became close friends.“Joel has a really great sense of humor,” says Shelley. “I love that about him. And he just really has a sensitive heart to people, all people around him, he looks out for people.”“That really attracted me to him. And also, he used to have a nice dark head of hair. I really liked that too. But he has a very distinguished look now, and he’s just as handsome as ever.”About a year after they first met, Joel and Shelley were deployed abroad, together.That’s when they “kind of started dating,” as Joel puts it. While there wasn’t much opportunity to go on actual dates on active service, they bonded.“Conversations, talking about everything, basically,” says Shelley. “We really got to know each other’s heart that way. And I think it just made it clear that this is what we were supposed to do.”Back home in the US, the two “started officially dating.”“We just kind of knew that this was going to be it,” says Joel. “And within a few months, we got married.”Joel and Shelley became instructor Air Force pilots in Mississippi. Then, in the early 2000s, Shelley gave birth to the couple’s kids, two twins, a boy and a girl. Shelley left flying around this time, but she stayed in the military, working for the US Air National Guard.“I wanted to be at home,” says Shelley.The path to pregnancy wasn’t easy for the couple and Joel calls their kids a “huge blessing.”“We went through in vitro a couple of times,” he says. “It took a few years for us to actually get pregnant.”The family relocated back to Colorado and Joel transitioned from military flying to commercial flying, becoming a pilot with Southwest Airlines in 2006.Cut to 2021. The pandemic years were tough going for Joel and Shelley, emotionally speaking. While the couple stayed healthy, their kids were in their late teens and struggled with the upheaval. Plus, Covid was impacting the aviation industry, so Joel was flying less. Around this time, Shelley left her job at the National Guard. She and Joel were wholly focused on their family and their kids’ wellbeing.But in time, the pandemic waned and Joel started flying more regularly. Joel and Shelley’s kids graduated high school and started the next phase of their lives. It was a transitional period for the Atkinson family, and in turn, Shelley started considering her future.She found herself dreaming about flying. She hadn’t been behind the controls of a plane in over two decades, but she felt a call to return. She started wondering if, like Joel, she could become a commercial pilot.When Shelley voiced the idea to Joel, he was immediately enthusiastic.“I said, ‘Come fly with me,’” says Joel, joking “cue the music.”Then, by coincidence, later that day, Joel saw a social media post from his airline, Southwest, about a pilot who’d taken a two decade break to raise a family, then returned to flying.“She literally had the same story as me,” says Shelley.It felt like a sign. While Joel didn’t know this other pilot directly, he was able to reach out to her via his work network and pass on contact details to Shelley, who subsequently texted the other pilot, asking for guidance and advice. Then, with encouragement from her new friend – plus Joel’s wholehearted support – Shelley committed to returning to the skies full time.While Shelley had years of Air Force experience, she hadn’t flown airplanes for 20 years. She had had to hit the books, take additional tests and ensure her qualifications were up to speed.But before long Shelley was hired by SkyWest Airlines, flying regional jets. Then she joined Joel at Southwest in 2023.“It was crazy. It happened way faster than I thought it would. It’s been amazing,” says Shelley.“It was meant to be,” says Joel.Joel and Shelley credit their success as a co-pilot team to their nearly three decades of marriage, as well as years of co-parenting.“Raising two teenagers during Covid, I tell people that was a lot harder than what we’re doing now,” says Joel.Plus, the two met as colleagues – so they know how to balance commitment to a job with enjoying each other’s company.Still, as a married couple in the military, Joel and Shelley never flew in the same aircraft.“The military kind of frowns upon it,” says Joel. “It’s a little morbid, but they don’t want you to both go down in a plane crash.”No such guidelines exist in commercial aviation, and so once Shelley joined Southwest, she and Joel were able to work side by side. Joel’s seniority allows him to regularly bid for flights with Shelley. And the two find Joel’s years of commercial aviation experience pairs well with Shelley’s fresh take.“She looks to me and relies on me for the experience that I have. But I also know that she is a very sharp person, she just went through a lot of training. So her knowledge is fresh. And she also has that wisdom and judgment,” says Joel.Since the excitement of their first flight, Joel and Shelley tend not to “make a big deal” about being a husband and wife pilot duo – unless it’s preempted by their colleagues.“We wait for them to ask,” says Shelley. As the couple share the same last name, often crew members put two and two together.As Joel’s the more senior of the two, he often runs the pre-flight briefing. Sometimes he’ll end it with a quick, throwaway: “Yes, we’re married.”The crew usually “start laughing,” says Joel.When Joel and Shelley are taking off and landing, they’re focused on the job at hand. “It’s very technical,” says Joel. “We’re running checklists.”But when the airplane reaches cruising altitude, “there’s some downtime” and Joel and Shelley will make the most of it, talking through their thoughts on life, their kids, their future plans and everything else that’s on their mind.“It’s so great, because all the years that I was flying, and she was at home, anything I wanted to talk to her about when I’m up in the air, it had to wait,” says Joel. “You’re saving up conversations until you’re home. It’s like now we’re making up for lost time.”Then, when they land, Joel and Shelley make the most of the layovers. Southwest largely flies domestically, so the couple enjoy traveling the length and breadth of the US together.“It is a great job, because you go see different places and spend time in different cities,” says Joel, but before Shelley joined Southwest, Joel says layovers sometimes felt like “wasted time, because it was just me, and I couldn’t share it with her.”“But now we’re together when we’re on the road – it’s so fun. Because every night on the road, it’s a date night together,” he says.Now, instead of counting the days until he’s home, Joel says his “home is right here” because “she’s with me.”While Joel and Shelley have flown together countless times since Shelley joined Southwest, they’ve yet to fly with their kids in tow. That’s on the to-do list – plus, their son is also training to be a pilot, so there’s a chance Shelley and Joel might pilot an aircraft with him in the future.For Shelley, an additional perk of the last couple of years is her adult kids getting to “view her as a pilot for the first time.”Shelley and Joel’s children grew up knowing their parents met flying jets – but while they saw their father regularly piloting airplanes for Southwest, they never saw Shelley flying. Shelley is really happy her children get to see her doing a job she loves.Shelley’s also proud to be a female pilot in an industry that’s still very male-dominated. She hopes to inspire other people, especially mothers who may have taken a break from the workplace to raise a family, by demonstrating that returning to a passion is possible.“I hope it encourages other women that there is this opportunity out there – you can come back and you can still do it,” she says.Shelley says she’s really loved rediscovering her love of flying.“The view from 36,000 feet is pretty awesome,” she says. “Flying over parts of the country - I just love looking down and going, ‘Oh, what town is that?’”Shelley and Joel particularly enjoy flying in and out of San Diego, California, but they also love it when Southwest takes them to New York. Before Christmas, they enjoyed a stopover in New York City and went searching for the settings of their favorite movies, from “Elf” to “Serendipity.”“I love traveling, seeing new places,” says Joel, who adds that he’s gone from avoiding working weekends to voluntarily signing up for Saturday and Sunday flight shifts. He and Shelley now spend Saturday nights watching jazz in Portland, going on hikes in Sacramento or drinking cocktails in Palm Springs.Joel’s always loved flying – especially what he calls “the art and science” of aviation. He also loves “serving people, getting them to where they need to be,” but he admits flying during the pandemic was hard going. For Joel, having Shelley now by his side at work has “been just a complete turnaround.” Now even the ride to work is fun as the couple car share, coffees in hand.Joel and Shelley, who post about their adventures on their Instagram account @luvpilots, are currently planning to pick up a flight together on Valentine’s Day. Joel bought the two of them heart-printed ties especially – they’re “silly, but fun,” says Joel.The couple enjoy chronicling their travels on social media – celebrating their marriage, their respective careers and their adventures.“We feel blessed. We’re thankful for the opportunity,” says Joel. “We’re thankful to Southwest Airlines for letting us do this together.”“If you love doing something, why not do it with the person you love?” says Shelley."

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Tourists visiting the southern Spanish city of Seville may soon have to pay a fee to explore the wide, ornate Plaza de Espana square, the city hall said, as part of plans to control tourist overload in a public open space.“We are planning to close the Plaza de Espana and charge tourists to finance its conservation and ensure its safety,” Mayor Jose Luis Sanz wrote in a post on social media platform X, accompanied with a video showing missing tiles, damaged facades and street vendors occupying alcoves and stairs.Complete with a semicircular Neo-Moorish palatial structure framed with tall towers on both ends and four bridges over a moat, the Plaza is part of a complex built for the 1929 Ibero-American Exhibition that was designed to reflect Spanishness in its architecture and tiled decorations.Thousands of people from all over the world visit it daily, in horse-drawn carriages or on foot.The structure served as the set of the 1999 film “The Phantom Menace” of the Star Wars franchise, and is also a hot spot of cultural life in Seville, hosting concerts, plays and fashion shows.Although Sanz made clear that local residents would still be allowed free access, many X users, including those from Seville, were quick to criticize the plan.“A tourism tax for ALL visitors provokes less debate and generates more income. Listen to the people, not the hoteliers,” wrote one user.Another added: “What people want from you is a tourism tax and general regulation of mass tourism which is destroying our city”.With more than three million tourists a year and a population of 700,000, Seville is the third most visited city in Spain, which in turn is one of the world’s most visited countries, with tourism representing 13% of GDP.Many cities are struggling to find balance between much-needed tourism and maintaining their appeal to residents. Italy’s lagoon city of Venice will introduce a trial fee from April to limit the number of day trippers."

        "title": "These athletes suffered life-changing injuries. Then, they turned to psychedelics",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Daniel Carcillo wanted two things in life: to play hockey and to be a father.The Canadian started ice skating aged three and got his start in professional ice hockey as soon as he graduated high school.By 20 he’d broken into the NHL and over the next decade would play for the Philadelphia Flyers, New York Rangers and Los Angeles Kings.By 30, he was a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the Chicago Blackhawks and, in 2015, had retired from the sport, poised to enjoy retirement with his wife and three children, he says.By age 31, he was suicidal.After seven diagnosed concussions, Carcillo tells CNN that he was suffering from “dementia-like” symptoms, along with depression, anxiety and headaches, so much so that even a day out with his kids felt torturous.“If they want to go outside on a very sunny day, and I can’t find my dark glasses to block the sun out … I would try to go outside and tough it … that would trigger a headache, and that would trigger head pressure,” Carcillo tells CNN Sport.“Your impulse control is off,” he explained. “It would be miserable … Eventually, I would just go inside.”Carcillo says he also suffered from insomnia and disrupted sleep and would go to bed at 4 or 5 a.m., trying to sleep as much as he could during the day so that he wasn’t around anybody or in the sun.“It’s a very lonely place to be,” he says.He spent over $500,000 on prescription medications and treatments at stroke rehabilitation centers, brain centers, and concussion centers, as well as holistic therapies, and worried that he was a “burden in people’s lives.”Then in a “last-ditch effort” to try and alleviate his symptoms, he says he took a dose of psilocybin – the main psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms – in Denver, which became the first US city to decriminalize hallucinogenic mushrooms.“And I woke up the next day and I describe it as feeling the way I should,” said Carcillo. “I felt like, for the first time in a very, very long time, I had a zest for life. All I wanted to do was get on FaceTime and call my wife and call my kids and get back home.”Carcillo isn’t the only athlete – former or current – openly talking about using psychedelics to treat various conditions.Psychedelics, described by Harvard Health as a “loosely grouped class of drugs that are able to induce altered thoughts and sensory perceptions” - including acid (LSD), mushrooms (psilocybin), ecstasy (MDMA), ayahuasca, DMT (dimethyltryptamine) and ketamine - have a checkered legal history.In 2022, residents in Colorado joined Oregon in voting to legalize psilocybin.Small clinical trials have shown that one or two doses of psilocybin, given in a therapeutic setting, can make dramatic and long-lasting changes in people suffering from treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, though scientists are still exploring the how and the why behind the connection between psychedelics and improved mental health.Last year, Australia became the first country in the world to legalize clinical prescribing of MDMA, more commonly known as ecstasy, and psilocybin for certain mental health disorders.But experts also warn that taking psilocybin and other hallucinogens comes with potential health risks, such as psychosis or other longer-term mental health issues in some, as well as physical effects such as raised blood pressure and heart rate abnormalities.NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers has continued to advocate for the legalization of some psychedelics, claiming last year that ayahuasca – a drink made from Amazonian plants that contain a psychoactive ingredient – helped to improve his performance on the football field.“Is it not ironic that the things that actually expand your mind are illegal and the things that keep you in the lower chakras [energy points in the body] and dumb you down have been legal for centuries?” Rodgers said last year at a psychedelics conference in Denver.Former pro boxer Mike Tyson has said that magic mushrooms changed his life, and UFC President Dana White in 2021 said the organization was “diving in” to research on psychedelic drugs as a therapy for fighters’ brain health.Elite athletes experience mental health disorder symptoms and psychological distress at similar, if not higher, rates to the general population, researchers pointed out in a study published in the Journal of Applied Sport Psychology.Courtney Walton, an academic fellow in psychology at Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, told CNN that many athletes fear seeking mental health support, believing “they may be perceived as somehow less competent or resilient than their peers and competitors, which can be made worse by upcoming team or coaching selection pressures.He added that “athletes might overlook or normalize symptoms of mental ill-health, as rationalized within a highly pressurized environment.”Walton explained it is “likely that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy has particular appeal to athletes given the more time-constrained nature of treatment.”He added that “psychedelics do not typically appear to have significant physical side effects” which could appeal to athletes who have experienced or heard of negative experiences with psychiatric medicine affecting performance.UFC Senior Vice President of Athlete Health and Performance Jeff Novitzky said in May 2021 that White gave him a “directive” to explore psychedelic research to see if it helps with addiction and mental-health problems, as well as traumatic brain injury.Novitzky told CNN the UFC is interested in any therapies that have the potential to improve brain health, and that the organization has had discussions with experts from institutions like Johns Hopkins and the University of Miami about the potential application of psychedelics, though nothing has progressed past preliminary conversations at this stage.“All the scientists that we’ve talked to said, ‘Hey, there’s a potential real benefit here to treat brain injuries and for brain health,’” said Novitzky, adding there is still negative stigma associated with some drugs, citing cannabis.Three years ago, the UFC changed its anti-doping policy so that ”positive tests over the threshold and decision limit for carboxy-THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, will no longer be considered a violation of the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, unless additional evidence exists that an athlete used it intentionally for performance-enhancing purposes,” according to a news release posted on their site in 2021.Researchers in the field say that psychedelics are shown to work when treating some mental health conditions.“The case is compelling when you look at this as a psychological treatment, where you might be treating depression or more or less any other psychiatric disorder with a couple of exceptions,” Robin Carhart-Harris, Ralph Metzner Distinguished Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at University of California San Francisco, told CNN Sport.However, when it comes to treating brain injuries with psychedelics, “the truth of the matter is that there’s a lot that’s not known,” Carhart-Harris, former head of the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London, added.“There is an increasing amount of evidence to suggest that psychedelics promote aspects of brain growth,” he says, adding: “We need that smoking gun: a clear demonstration of this in an injured brain where we see regeneration afterwards. And at the moment, we’re close, but no cigar,” he said.Carhart-Harris warned that psychedelics are “potent” and have the power to make people “psychologically agitated” when they are already psychologically vulnerable.“People think they can just turn on, tune in and cure themselves. And it’s not that simple,” he added, explaining that if psychedelics aren’t paired with psychological support or psychotherapy they can be “harmful.”James Rucker, a consultant psychiatrist and a senior clinical lecturer at King’s College London, said that evidence has shown that psilocybin can be used to manage treatment-resistant depression but warns that psychedelics are “very hyped,” with people having “huge expectations” as to their impacts.“With great expectation comes great capacity for disappointment,” Rucker said, adding that while this can often be dealt with positively in a medical setting, “if you’re on your own, if you’re in a crappy situation, that can make things worse.”Following the head injuries sustained during his hockey career, the now 39-year-old Carcillo began struggling with depression and anxiety and was self-medicating with alcohol, painkillers, muscle relaxers and sleep aids.Suffering from slurred speech, weight loss and memory issues, he became “very disinterested in life” after the birth of his first child.“I just didn’t care, which was very weird that I felt that disconnected because I’ve always wanted to be a dad. It was kind of scary,” he said.Carcillo was one of several hundred players who accused the NHL of failing to prevent hockey-related head trauma and hiding the dangers. The lawsuit was settled in 2018, with the league not accepting liability for the claims.In 2019, by now a father of three, Carcillo found himself in a “very, very dark, dark place. I didn’t think I had a way out.”He began reading medical papers and found a psilocybin study from the Imperial College of London, where researchers found “the psychedelic compound may effectively reset the activity of key brain circuits known to play a role in depression.”That’s when Carcillo traveled to a decriminalized city and “partook in a really large dose ceremony,” taking the psilocybin recreationally and not part of a clinical study.Later, he founded Wesana Health, a biotechnology company which focuses on developing psychedelic medicine for mental health, the most recent being a CBD and psilocybin-based drug.The company met with the US Food and Drug Administration in March 2022 and has been working through the early drug development process, and recently sold the program to NASDAQ-listed Lucy Scientific Discovery. He is no longer involved in the company.He told CNN that he regularly microdoses psilocybin, as well as partaking in larger doses from time to time.“I continue to monitor my health with regular brain scans and blood work, and adjust my dosing schedule of medicinal mushrooms accordingly,” he added.Carcillo is clear that his current well-being isn’t solely due to psilocybin, saying he exercises regularly, is careful to manage his sleep as well as sugar and alcohol intake, and makes sure to get out and about in the sunshine.Former US rugby player Anna Symonds says she was diagnosed with TBI about 10 years ago and has to take several different hormones that her body – notably her pituitary gland – is not making as a result of the head injuries.Now retired from rugby, Symonds tells CNN Sport she has started to feel the effects of injuries to her body and head from years of participating in contact sports like rugby, soccer and mixed martial arts as well as being involved in two car crashes.“I was physically not feeling well. In addition to my pituitary issues, I have an autoimmune issue with my thyroid,” she explains, adding that she also experiences headaches, memory issues, depression and anxiety.She began using psychedelics to help with this, taking part in “macrodose-level journeys or ceremonies with mushrooms, LSD, ayahuasca and Toad.”Also known as the Colorado River toad or the Sonoran Desert toad, the amphibian releases a venom called 5-MeO-DMT, which is known to have hallucinogenic effects, according to the Addiction Center website, which also warns of its dangers. Symonds used a synthetic form of the compound, which does not harm the toads.Since her retirement as an athlete, Symonds explains that she uses psychedelic drugs for clarity, though not under the direction of a doctor.She adds that using cannabis for pain relief or using psilocybin does not necessarily elicit dramatic changes compared with other plant-based psychedelics.“It’s this groove, it’s the spiral that you can’t seem to get out of, and it just almost reinforces itself. The experience of plant medicines is for me, like psychedelics, is that it lifts you out of the groove.”Guidance from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) states that the effects of psychedelic and dissociative drugs may be difficult to predict and depend on many factors.Short-term side effects from the drugs can include headaches, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, high blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, trembling and diarrhea, the NIH notes, though it adds that reported cases of side-effects likely represent only a very small number of users.Rucker tells CNN: “I feel I need to draw a clear line between what we do in our clinical trials - which is safe and contained - and recreational use, which can be therapeutic, but can be dangerous, and is, by definition, experimental.”Rucker added that it’s important not to overhype the effects of substances like psilocybin for mental health conditions, as other treatments including antidepressants, lithium, cognitive behavior therapy, meditation and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can have similar effects.“They’re special, they’re unique, but they’re not that special,” says Rucker. “They’re just drugs. And we need to work out where they sit and not be too gung-ho with them.”Rucker says that more education is needed around psychedelics, as regardless of a country’s laws, people will continue to take these substances.“We need to make sure that people are doing their homework and not treating this as a recreational drug like any other but actually treating it with the respect it deserves,” he tells CNN.Carhart-Harris explains “all aspects of mental illness can fall on anyone, whether they be a sportsperson or not.”Still, he adds that psychedelics could be harnessed to enhance sporting performance, through enhancing discipline or helping people to process pressure or failure.“Then you have the sort of positive psychology side, where you could use, for example, low doses of psychedelics to enhance some of the training, say, getting more into one’s body, more easily entering flow states, intense focus, not being too heady and cerebral. I think there is real potential for using psychedelics in a sort of skillful way,” Carhart-Harris says.Symonds adds: “Medicines don’t just have to be a treatment for when you’re sick or ill or broken, they can be something that you take to keep you well or to enhance your wellness, your wellbeing, your spirituality.”"

        "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbappé – including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year – it was slammed by critics as sportswashing.Mbappé might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (€90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports.In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe’s major leagues – France’s Ligue 1, Spain’s La Liga, Italy’s Serie A, Germany’s Bundesliga and the English Premier League – according to Deloitte.Despite the Arab nation’s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia’s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn’t “care” about the country’s investment in sport being described as sportswashing.“Well if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,” MBS said in an interview with Fox News which aired Wednesday.Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: “I don’t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we’re going to get that one and a half percent.”Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation’s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport.By attracting some of the world’s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants “to drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,” though it’s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop “young Saudi talent.”During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt.Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D’Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid.As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (€835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (€353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year.The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world’s highest paid soccer player.As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees – all international stars – play for one of the PIF-owned clubs.Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was “not in [the SPL’s] competitive advantage” to report the salaries offered to players and coaches.The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players.Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (£700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (£12 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq.In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers “just aren’t true.”“Essentially, the signal is ‘We mean business,’” Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.“We’ve got so much money that for a player who is … coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he’s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,” Chadwick said, describing Saudi’s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost.Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries – including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses.It remains to be seen whether Saudi’s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort.The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country’s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi’s victory over Argentina during last year’s men’s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win.Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. “For example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you’re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,” Chadwick said.Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of “The Price of Football” podcast.“From the Saudi authorities’ point of view, they’re getting a ready-made product. Everybody’s heard of Benzema. Everybody’s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,” Maguire said.Saudi Arabia’s lofty sporting ambitions don’t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup.Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men’s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt – although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy.Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between €35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year.Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country’s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals – and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30. Of this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport.Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia’s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring – and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated.Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, “what is just as significant is the security of the royal family,” Chadwick adds.The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region.Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria.“What we’re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,” Chadwick said.“You want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it … But don’t question us,” Chadwick explained.Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer “can be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.”At the same time, there has been “a significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country” this year, Chadwick told CNN.Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years.In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed.“Reputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and … Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,” James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, “The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,” explains.Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices.Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick – not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital.“Part of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that’s a way of attracting interest to the country,” said Maguire.CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of “sportswashing” its image.In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia’s purported “sportswashing,” the kingdom’s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: “People that don’t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they’ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi.“See what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,” he added.Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, “they feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.”In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport’s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up “owning golf.”Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men’s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport’s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control.“They have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,” he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours.When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football’s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose.“As far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don’t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don’t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,” he said last month.“When people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they’re playing.”Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: “I don’t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore.“I don’t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can’t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?” he added.Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is “no different from what the Premier League have done.”“There was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we’re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,” said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN.New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league’s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars.“We can’t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.” But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which “simply doesn’t exist in Saudi Arabia,” Chadwick explained to CNN.European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams’ spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs.Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy – up from its current value of “0.000 something.”“They’ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,” Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world’s domestic leagues.“That is feasible given the amount of money that they’re spending.”“I think they’re realistic. They don’t say that they’re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,” Maguire said.When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world’s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund.CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency.Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA’s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA’s systems of governance.The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia’s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour’s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf.Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league’s financial endeavors, “nobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.”“This vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,” Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is “signaling.”“It is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.”"

        "text": "The Phoenix Suns picked up an impressive – and unexpected – 117-107 overtime road win over the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday behind a 35-point performance from 2014 NBA MVP Kevin Durant.After a three-game skid in the middle of February, the Nuggets had recently recaptured their form and entered the game against the Suns on a six-game winning streak.Led by 25 points, 16 rebounds and five assists from MVP candidate Nikola Jokić, the Nuggets looked on course to make it a seventh straight victory until Durant hit a step-back three-pointer with just 27 seconds remaining to tie the game.Durant had been struggling with his shooting late in the game, going 1-for-8 in the fourth quarter before his game-tying bucket, but stepped up at the crucial moment.“I knew coming across half-court: ‘This is do-or-die right here, I’ve got make this shot or it might be game,’” Durant said, per the NBA. “My fundamentals were right on that one.“It felt good leaving my hands. … I just love hearing the crowd go silent. That’s always a good feeling on the road.”After scoring a miserly 12 points in the fourth quarter to allow the Nuggets to complete their comeback from 22 points down in the third, the Suns put up 15 in overtime – five of which came from Bradley Beal – and put the clamps on Denver, limiting the home team to five points in the extra period.In the absence of star guard Devin Booker, who missed his second straight game with an ankle injury, the Suns were helped by 28 points from Grayson Allen, including eight triples.“You look at the totality of the season, obviously, the end result is always important, playing in the playoffs, trying to win a championship, those are important,” Durant added.“But you celebrate little moments.”Jokić, who made an absurd spinning step-back three-pointer to beat the buzzer at the end of the first quarter, had the chance to win the game at the death but his last-gasp floater was off the mark.Jamal Murray added 28 points, seven rebounds and nine assists for the defending champion Nuggets, who now sit third in the Western Conference, while Michael Porter Jr. added 20 points and seven rebounds.“This is one of those where tomorrow we all feel better,” Murray added. “Tomorrow, we have better clarity and a lot more positive energy, but today, it’s tough.“It wasn’t just one person who didn’t shoot well, it was damn near everybody.”Victory for the Suns snaps a two-game skid, with the team currently sixth in the West and still fighting to avoid the play-in."

        "title": "‘When I see Russian athletes … I see every city destroyed,’ says Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "At some point last year, Yaroslava Mahuchikh vowed to stop reading the news before competitions, so distressing did she find the stories and images of bloodshed in her native Ukraine.One of the world’s top high jumpers, Mahuchikh knew that absolute concentration was required to perfectly execute her run-up, take-off and back-arching leap, but still her mind would gravitate towards the distressing situation thousands of miles away back home.Perhaps that’s only natural when your country is at war and fresh missile attacks are being launched on a regular basis – some even directed at blocks in your hometown.“It’s challenging for me to compete after reading the news of rockets sent to civilians,” Mahuchikh tells CNN Sport. “I’m thinking about how many people died, how many peoples’ houses were destroyed. It’s difficult.”That strategy – of trying to shut out Russia’s invasion of Ukraine before she competes – proved effective last year. Mahuchikh won her first world championship title in August, then successfully defended her Diamond League Final victory in September.Understandably, her confidence is now high for the months ahead. That includes the Millrose Games in New York this weekend, the world indoor championships in Glasgow in March and then the Paris Olympics in July and August.She’s unsure if she will return to Ukraine in that time having moved between various training bases around Europe for most of the past two years. Because of the war, itinerancy has become a common theme in her life.“I live in a suitcase, really,” says Mahuchikh, “because with traveling, we don’t have a hometown.”Her family – her mother and sister – have sometimes joined the 22-year-old while she is on the road, but her father, like many Ukrainians, has stayed at home in Dnipro. That’s often a source of anxiety for Mahuchikh, especially when Russian attacks target the eastern city.“My father, he said that, unfortunately, for a lot of people, it’s life right now, we live in this way,” she explains.“And they continue their life. My father sometimes says, ‘Oh, you know, if the rockets come, it’s okay, it’s my life, maybe it’s God saying that it’s finished.’ And I say, ‘Oh my gosh, father, please – go to the basement.’”Dnipro has absorbed several deadly missile attacks throughout the invasion, with the Russian military targeting apartment blocks and medical facilities in the city.In August last year, Ukraine’s War Crimes Department in the Prosecutor General’s Office said that approximately 10,749 civilians had been killed during the war and 15,599 wounded.Yet even as fighting rages on, Mahuchikh still longs for the familiarity of being back home with her family and friends.“If I was not an athlete at international level, I think I would be in Ukraine,” she says. “But I have some goals and I’m competing for my country. I represent Ukraine at competitions; it’s my goal and it’s my mission, I think.”Russia’s invasion has invigorated Mahuchikh’s sense of national pride. She wore blue and yellow eye shadow – the colors of the Ukrainian flag – at last year’s world championships and is supporting fundraising efforts to send wheelchairs to disabled orphans in Ukraine.She also hopes that competing at high-profile events and winning gold medals will provide her with a platform from which to highlight her country’s plight.“I feel that I am an ambassador of Ukraine and I have this possibility to involve a lot of people in this problem that Ukrainian people now have,” says Mahuchikh.“A lot of families are under rocket attack; a lot of children, unfortunately, lost their parents or parents lost their children. It’s so sad, and it’s so sad that a lot of athletes and coaches died in this war. But I want to help my country. It’s the main goal.”According to Vadim Guttsait, Ukraine’s sports minister and president of its National Olympic Committee (NOC), more than 400 Ukrainian athletes have been killed since the start of the war.This year’s Olympics, Mahuchikh believes, will enable Ukrainian athletes to promote a message of peace, though perhaps inevitably, the Games have also become entwined in geopolitics.In particular, the question of whether athletes from Russia and Belarus, a key military launchpad during the war in Ukraine, will be able to compete has become a flashpoint.In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that athletes from those two countries will be able to take part as neutrals in Paris, so long as they meet certain eligibility criteria.For example, only individual athletes, rather than teams, will be included in the Games, and athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to their country’s military services will be ineligible.However, international federations have the first say on whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can qualify for the Olympics. World Athletics, the governing body of track and field, has excluded Russian and Belarusians from events “for the foreseeable future,” meaning they will be unable to compete in track and field events in Paris as things stand.It’s a contentious topic: some, like the IOC’s executive board, believe that individual athletes shouldn’t be stopped from competing on the basis of their passport, while others, namely a campaign group representing Ukrainian athletes, argue that Russian participation of any kind only strengthens the country’s “propaganda machine.”Mahuchikh welcomes World Athletics’ stance, believing that neutral flags are an ineffective way of concealing an athlete’s national identity.“When I see Russian athletes … I see every city destroyed, every life that was destroyed by Russian people, by the Russian Federation,” she says, adding that she would find it “difficult” to compete against athletes from Russia and Belarus.Last month, more than 200 sportspeople from Ukraine wrote a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron, urging Russians and Belarusians to be banned from competing at the Games.However, neither local organizers nor the French government have jurisdiction over who qualifies for the Olympics, and Paris 2024 organizers have underlined that this responsibility lies with the IOC and international federations.Guttsait has previously suggested that Ukraine could boycott the Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete, though a final decision is yet to be made.Mahuchikh is against such a move, instead believing that the Olympics should represent “peace in all the world.” A bronze medalist in Tokyo three years ago, she is also one of Ukraine’s biggest stars in Paris, aiming to win what would be her country’s first gold medal in the high jump.“Every athlete wants to compete, every athlete wants to win the gold medal,” says Mahuchikh. “Of course, I have goals for winning, and I want to have this medal in my sports career.”She has tweaked her technique ahead of the upcoming indoor season, shortening her run-up to compensate for her increased speed as she approaches the bar. Having made her season debut in Cottbus, Germany, last weekend – finishing first after clearing a world-leading height of two meters and four centimeters (about 6.69 feet) – the new technique will be put to the test again at the Millrose Games.This is where Mahuchikh’s immediate focus lies, but in the long term, she has loftier ambitions for her career – namely Stefka Kostadinova’s world record of two meters and nine centimeters (about 6.86 feet).The Bulgarian’s mark has stood since 1987, making it one of the longest-standing world records in track and field. Mahuchikh has watched the likes of Karsten Warholm and Mondo Duplantis – both, like her, sponsored by Puma – set records in the 400-meter hurdles and the pole vault respectively, and now she hopes to join the club.“I believe that one day I will jump 2.10,” she says. “I want to be part of this family of world record holders.”"

        "text": "YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul is set to face heavyweight legend Mike Tyson in an exhibition boxing match on July 20. The event will be broadcast exclusively on Netflix and held at the 80,000-seat capacity AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, home of the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys.“Iron Mike,” 57, last fought professionally in June 2005 and boasts a 50-6 career record, with 44 of his victories coming by way of knockout. The former world heavyweight champion is widely considered one of the best boxers in history.The 27-year-old Paul, meanwhile, has transitioned from YouTube to professional boxing and has won nine of his 10 fights. His only defeat came against Tommy Fury, the younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, in February 2023.“My sights are set on becoming a world champion, and now I have a chance to prove myself against the greatest heavyweight champion ever, the baddest man on the planet and the most dangerous boxer of all time,” Paul said in a statement.“This will be the fight of a lifetime.”Tyson – a member of the boxing Hall of Fame – came out of retirement to face Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition match, which ended in a controversial split draw, in 2020. Paul beat former NBA player Nate Robinson on the undercard of that fight.“He’s grown significantly as a boxer over the years, so it will be a lot of fun to see what the will and ambition of a ‘kid’ can do with the experience and aptitude of a GOAT (greatest of all time),” Tyson said of Paul, per a statement.“It’s a full circle moment that will be beyond thrilling to watch; as I started him on his boxing journey on the undercard of my fight with Roy Jones and now I plan to finish him.”Internet personalities taking up boxing has come a long way in the last five years.Ever since the first fights involving YouTube stars KSI and Joe Weller back in 2017, people from all walks of life – from TikTok to music – have slipped on the gloves and stepped into the ring, with the exhibition demographic of the sport growing rapidly.What seemingly started as a money-driven decision from Paul has since developed into an apparent love for boxing, with the social media personality working hard to be taken seriously by those within the sport.The fight in July is likely to generate huge sums of money for both men and, in Tyson, will provide fans an opportunity to see one of the most dangerous fighters in history in the ring once again."

        "text": "Tiger Woods’ 15-year-old son, Charlie Woods, will compete in a pre-qualifier event Thursday in hopes of making the field for his first PGA Tour start next week.Charlie, who won a state championship with his Palm Beach high school golf teammates in November, will tee it up Thursday in Hobe Sound, Florida, at one of four pre-qualifying sites, according to the PGA Tour website.To qualify for the PGA Tour’s Cognizant Classic, Charlie would need to advance from the pre-qualifier and then again from the event’s qualifier Monday.The PGA Tour said just four qualifiers will advance from Monday’s event into the Cognizant Classic field. If successful, this would mark Charlie’s first PGA Tour start. His father has won 82 PGA Tour event titles – tied with the late Sam Snead for the most ever – and first played in a professional event in 1992 as a 16-year-old amateur.Aside from winning a state championship, Woods and his legendary father have played together at the PGA Tour’s annual PNC Championship tournament. The father-son duo have competed four times at the event which sees past major-winning golfers team up with a family member.Throughout their four PNC Championship appearances, television broadcasts showed how strikingly similar the pair’s distinct golf mannerisms are.“He is his own person. That’s one of the things that we made sure of that Charlie is Charlie,” Tiger Woods said in 2021 when a PGA Tour video crew showed him a video compilation video of how similar the pair are on the course. “I am proud of whatever direction he chooses.”CNN has reached out to Tiger Woods for comment.CNN’s Steve Almasy contributed to this report."

        "title": "These young athletes were bound for stardom until a mysterious condition derailed their running careers",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "They were two exceptionally promising athletes, seemingly bound for track and field stardom, when their careers were derailed by a condition that doctors and researchers say they are only now beginning to understand.Their experiences highlight the damaging expectations that can surround athletes, blurring the thin line between the discipline that allows athletes to achieve superhuman feats and the disordered patterns of behavior that can harm their health, as they push themselves, and are pushed by their coaches and trainers.Mary Cain was the youngest ever US track and field athlete to make the World Championships team, a teenage phenomenon who held several national age-group records in middle-distance running.Pippa Woolven was one of the UK’s best steeplechase athletes, winning British university championships, competing in the 2012 World Junior Championships and earning an athletic scholarship to Florida State University.Then, as both women edged closer to the pinnacle of athletics, they developed Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs).The syndrome occurs when someone of any gender has overtrained and/or undereaten for a prolonged period in an attempt to improve their athletic performance, often without knowing the dangers of failing to compensate for the energy they expend in training, racing and their daily lives.Left untreated, medical experts say REDs can damage an athlete’s metabolism, their bone health – leading to more fractures – their immune system, their cardiovascular health, their menstrual cycle, and mental health, as well as their athletic performance.Where training safely transforms into REDs is “different for everyone,” Dr. Farrah Jawad, a consultant at Pure Sports Medicine specializing in the condition, tells CNN Sport.The condition can often develop unintentionally and requires individual solutions to account for different levels of physical activity and food intake, she adds.Woolven, now 30, tells CNN Sport, that she wouldn’t be surprised “if it was the most widespread medical condition in sport.”“It’s more prevalent in endurance sports because of the … high energy expenditure (and) an emphasis on a lean physique but … literally anybody can be affected by it.”Uncertainty remains around the true prevalence of the condition, “with estimates ranging between 15% and 80% of elite athletes,” according to the IOC, and it varies across different sports.“We do think the deeper you start asking these questions … the numbers seem to be pretty high,” Dr. Kathryn Ackerman, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and director of the Female Athlete Program in the Sports Medicine Division at Boston Children’s Hospital, tells CNN Sport.If REDs historically has suffered from a lack of awareness in sport, Cain and Woolven, alongside healthcare providers, are seeking to build a new culture and “a place to pursue peak performance in a healthy body and mind,” as the British athlete’s advocacy website says.“Developing this negative relationship with your body where your body starts failing you … it can compound the effects of body dysmorphia because you’re not only disliking how you look, you’re disliking how it’s responding to stress,” said Cain.Shortly before Cain, now 27, first publicly spoke about her experiences suffering from REDs, she says she changed from thinking “I was the failure, I couldn’t handle it,” to (it) was actually this system.”Although many different factors can cause REDs, Cain tells CNN that for her it was due to a “toxic external environment” and “abuse” at the Nike Oregon Project that “changed (her) mindset around sport.”Once she had come to this realization, she decided to detail those experiences at the Nike Oregon Project in a video 0p-ed for The New York Times in 2019.In it, she said that she suffered with suicidal thoughts and self-harm, accusing her coach, famed long-distance marathoner Alberto Salazar, of publicly shaming her if she did not make her weight target. She says she broke five bones and didn’t have a period for three years while training there.Cain also said in the op-ed that she was put on a diet that left her so hungry, she secretly stole food from her teammates which she ate in the bathroom.“The repercussions of that are going to leak into everything,” she told CNN. “It’s just going to be horrible, especially when you’re undereating and underfueling yourself (and) your ability to just quite literally live.”Responding to Cain’s allegations at the time, Nike told CNN that it would launch an “immediate investigation” and that “these allegations are completely inconsistent with our values.”CNN’s multiple calls to Nike and Salazar seeking comment for this story, have not been returned.The results of Nike’s investigation were not made public, but the company told Women’s Running that it was using its findings to identify areas, “where we can do better in supporting female athletes.”Salazar told The Oregonian at the time that he disputed Cain’s allegations and that her father, a medical doctor, was “deeply involved in her training” and consulted on medications that she used.He also said that he had referred Cain to a female doctor and contradicted Cain’s allegation that the Oregon Project team had not included a nutritionist and a sports psychologist.Offered the opportunity by CNN to respond to the Smithsonian story, Cain said that she wanted to focus on spreading awareness about REDs.Salazar further refuted Cain’s allegations in Sports Illustrated, saying at the time that his “foremost goal as a coach was to promote athletic performance in a manner that supported the good health and well-being of all my athletes.”In November, Nike and Salazar settled a $20 million lawsuit that Cain had filed in October 2021, in which she alleged that both parties acted negligently towards her, which had been “a substantial factor in causing, aggravating and/or exacerbating” several injuries, including REDs.Nike closed down the Oregon Project in 2019 shortly after the US Anti-Doping Agency banned Salazar for four years for “multiple anti-doping rule violations.”Salazar said he was “shocked” by the ban, claiming he was treated “unjustly” and “unethically” by the USADA.The New York Times reported, at the time, that it had received an email from Salazar denying many of Cain’s claims and saying, “he had supported her health and welfare.”Cain’s op-ed, however, did more than just detail her own allegations. It helped to spotlight the damaging effects of REDs and how its development can be influenced by the expectations and culture that surround an athlete.“The environment was such a win at all costs mindset … and so I think because I was so passionate about it, it was easy for me to get sucked into a different type of obsession with it, because that was the sort of obsession that people around me had,” she said.Initially, success for Woolven was as simple as getting a personal best or making a team for an event so that she could enjoy the “cool experience” of competing there, but that changed once she accepted a scholarship to attend Florida State in Tallahassee.“I moved to America, and I lost other aspects of my identity because it was so serious and it was so running-focused, I started to rely more and more on … the success – I needed to do well in running,” she says.In the intensity of a high-performance sporting environment, Woolven never “really recognized that I was becoming … a bit obsessive about exercise, a bit intense about my nutrition.”She says her period stopped – though at the time she didn’t realize as she was on birth control pills – and experienced problems with her digestive system as her mental health deteriorated.“It was like this slow unraveling into a really poor state of mental and physical health … I just couldn’t keep going,” she recalls.Eventually, Woolven stopped competing for about a year while recovering before returning to athletics, after which she competed at the international level again “in a healthy way.”She took time off for a second time when she got “swept up in the unintentional side of REDs again,” accidently overtraining and becoming fatigued, but returned once more before retiring for a third and final time.REDs’ symptoms can affect anyone, particularly athletes training in a culture that celebrates overtraining and undereating – or that has an unhealthy relationship with weight.Even without explicit abuse like Cain alleges she experienced, Woolven says she absorbed the expectations of the culture around her, contributing to her downward spiral.“These subtle changes were encouraged by the coaches,” she says, like “a competitiveness towards leaving the gym last” or “doing little extras … on top of your training” or cutting out food “deemed non-essential.”The potential dangers of overtraining and undereating can still be brushed aside – more than a third of female athletes have ignored missed periods, thinking that it was either normal or even beneficial, a UK Athlete Health survey found in May.“It’s our job as the professionals around them to really help athletes recognize when they’re pushing themselves too much or they’re not recovering enough. It’s important to sleep, it’s important to fuel, it’s important to have a rest day,” Dr. Ackerman says.There’s greater awareness about REDs thanks to the efforts of athletes like Woolven and Cain, as well as Dr. Ackerman whose research has helped to spotlight the adverse health effects of the condition.While on furlough from her job at the National Trust during lockdown, Woolven began blogging about her experiences, prompting a slew of responses from people around the world. Eventually, her blog morphed into Project RED-S – a site filled with resources for athletes, coaches and supporters.Meanwhile, Cain established the Atalanta NYC, employing professional female runners to mentor girls in the community alongside their training and racing, and also coaches at New York Road Runners.“If institutions aren’t going to change, can I at least make an institution that I know will be a safe space for people and will do some of the work that I really want to happen?” said Cain.And without “institutional buy-in,” she observes, facilitating widespread culture change in sport remains difficult for individuals.Obtaining a diagnosis of REDs was a long, difficult process for Woolven, beginning at Florida State where she says she underwent numerous tests and was infused with iron via a drip on a cancer ward.“Nobody was able to look at the holistic health picture … zoom out and say: ‘This girl has lost a significant amount of weight, she’s increased her training load, she’s experiencing all of these symptoms,’” she says.There isn’t a single diagnostic test for REDs, Dr. Jawad says, adding that a diagnosis is instead based on “how they present to you and you connect all the clues together.”In September, an IOC Consensus Statement written by a panel of experts, including Dr. Ackerman, was published and included new resources to improve the process of diagnosing and preventing REDs.Using this system, doctors will be able to look for “more than just one thing,” Dr.Ackerman says, removing the importance of one symptom such as periods stopping.It also lays out recommendations for preventing REDs such as prescreening an elite athlete’s disposition to disordered eating before implementing a plan to reduce body weight.Access to “dietician input … and appropriate psychological support if it’s needed,” can also help prevent and treat REDs, Dr. Jawad says.Once REDs has been identified “it’s not all doom and gloom,” she adds. “It is possible to reverse some of the negative effects of REDs. It can take a bit of time because there’s so many different components.”Treating the energy deficiency created in REDs ultimately involves some combination of eating more and training less though, Dr. Ackerman says, “treatment really depends on where you’re starting from” and may also require addressing “other health consequences” too.Woolven’s Project RED-S aims to provide that support she lacked and initiatives like this allow Cain to envision a future that “looks really bright.”“I’m hopeful,” Cain says. “But I don’t think we can rest on our laurels yet.”"

        "text": "Damian Lillard scored a game-high 41 points to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to an impressive 113-106 comeback victory over the Los Angeles Clippers and extend the team’s winning run.Playing without franchise star Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was nursing Achilles tendonitis in only his third missed game of the season, the Bucks overturned a 15-point second-half deficit and have now won six straight since the All-Star Break after the team’s early struggles under new head coach Doc Rivers.“It just shows who we’re becoming,” Lillard said, per ESPN. “Nobody talked about who wasn’t playing before the game … that just shows what’s expected, the standard that we’re starting to have, and who we’re becoming as a team.“We just trusted each other. Defensively, we’ve trusted our communication. We’ve depended on the next guy to do his job, and the same offensively.“Because our team is seeing the results that we’re getting from playing that way, even when it’s not going our way at points in the game, we trust it. It’s just coming back in our favor.”Lillard’s 41 points came on an efficient 12-of-22 shooting, including four three pointers, to go with four rebounds and four assists, while Bobby Portis added 28 points and 16 rebounds.The Bucks may have to continue coping without Antetokounmpo as the team begins a four-game road trip in the Bay Area against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, with Rivers telling reporters after the game that he was unsure whether the eight-time All-Star would recover in time.“It’s been on and off the last two or three games,” Rivers said of the injury, per ESPN. “This morning, he actually looked good … we’ll just figure it out from there.”For the Clippers, James Harden scored 29 points to go with eight assists and four rebounds, while Paul George registered 29 points and five rebounds.It was a tough night for Kawhi Leonard, however, who notched just 16 points on 6-of-19 shooting.The victory moves the Bucks back into second place in the Eastern Conference, while the Clippers stay as the fourth seed in the West after a third defeat in five games."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "That a crowd of thousands gathered for the funeral of Kelvin Kiptum was testament to the marathon world record holder’s staggering impact on his sport.Kiptum’s death in a road accident at the age of 24 has left a gaping hole in the distance running community, not least in his native Kenya.“You ask yourself so many questions as to why, but sometimes it’s hard to get answers,” double Olympic gold medalist David Rudisha tells CNN about his compatriot’s untimely death.According to police, Kiptum and his coach Gervais Hakizimana died at the scene of a crash outside the town of Eldoret in the Rift Valley.The star athlete broke the world record in just his third marathon race last year, running a time of two hours and 35 seconds in Chicago, and a few months prior to that had set a course record in London.In the year ahead, Kiptum had hoped to become the first man to run under two hours over the 26.2 miles of the marathon, as well as being a strong favorite to win gold at the Paris Olympics.Even in a country renowned for producing world-class runners, Kiptum was evidently a once-in-a-generation athlete, achieving so much in such a tragically short career.“The last few weeks have been a really sad moment for Kenyans,” says Rudisha, himself a world record holder over 800 meters. “To lose such a talented, young athlete, it’s not easy.“Kelvin was very special, coming up and running just three marathons, all of them under two hours, two minutes. That really shows how talented he was.”In breaking Eliud Kipchoge’s old world record of 2:01:09, Kiptum eclipsed a man many believed to be the greatest of all time – and he did so with apparent ease, effortlessly pulling away from his rivals in the closing stages of major marathons.He never had a chance to race the 39-year-old Kipchoge, but it was obvious that Kiptum would go on to succeed his compatriot as the standout distance runner of his generation.“He was very determined,” says Rudisha, “and you were expecting good things to come from him in the future … He just came for a short time, not many people knew him, but he was really becoming famous and he was such a lovely young guy.”Rudisha, best remembered for breaking his own 800-meter world record at the London 2012 Olympics, last raced in 2017, a year after he defended his Olympic title in Rio.He is now an enthusiastic spectator of athletics meets around the globe, and has high hopes for Emmanuel Wanyonyi, a 19-year-old tipped to win Kenya’s fifth-straight gold medal in the 800 meters this year.No athlete has come close to Rudisha’s world record in the years since it was set, but the 35-year-old has no qualms about seeing it taken by another athlete at some point in the future.“Everybody feels good to watch a world record,” he says. “With the future, with the improvement of new shoes, better stadiums … definitely one person will break it. And it will be good also to watch, so that I can also congratulate [them].”"

        "title": "They played for their country in their 20s. By their 40s, they had early onset dementia after playing this physical sport",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "By the time Alix Popham had reached his late 30s, he was finding some day-to-day tasks confusing and difficult.Popham’s wife, Mel, would have a conversation with her husband and an hour later he would have “no recollection,” he tells CNN Sport.“I was putting it down to kids, everyday living – I was making excuses,” says Popham, now a 44-year-old father of three and business owner.Then in September 2019, Popham went on a bike ride, got lost and blacked out.A former professional rugby union player, Popham started playing the sport at the early age of four and it quickly became his life.“By the age of six, seven, I realized, and people realized, that I was pretty good at it,” Popham, who played for top clubs in France, Wales and England and represented his home country, Wales, at two Rugby World Cups.“My memory of playing and specific games … is not really there. I’ve got no feelings or memories of being in stadiums,” he says.Lenny Woodard followed a similar trajectory to Popham, starting rugby at 10.Both men went on to earn a living from the sport they loved.By the time they had reached their 40s, their professional sporting careers ended and both Woodard and Popham, and their families, soon noticed something was very wrong.Woodard worked as a salesman and began experiencing similar issues to his compatriot.“I was losing track of conversations. People were telling me something and then I forgot what they said, I’d have to ask them to repeat the question,” says Woodard, who represented Wales in the two rugby codes of union and league.“I’d forget their name, even though I’d been speaking to them two minutes before,” Woodard, 47, says.Both men saw doctors, and within months, were given the same devastating news: not only did they have early onset dementia, but also, probable chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease associated with repeated head trauma.Popham was just 40 and Woodard 45.The neurodegenerative brain disease CTE, which can only be formally diagnosed after death and autopsy, is pathologically marked by an abnormal buildup of a protein called Tau, in the brain that can disable neuropathways and lead to a variety of clinical symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, aggression, depression, anxiety, impulse control issues and sometimes suicidal behavior.Popham and Woodard are two of more than 450 current and former rugby players who have now joined lawsuits to take legal action against global governing body World Rugby and the national governing bodies of England and Wales, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), Rugby Football League Limited, International Rugby League Limited and British Amateur Rugby League Association.Lawyers for the plaintiffs say there was a failure to protect them from permanent injury caused by repeated head injuries and concussions during their careers.These governing bodies, the claimants allege, “were negligent in failing to take reasonable action in order to protect players from permanent injury caused by repetitive concussive and sub-concussive blows,” according to a press release sent to CNN Sport by attorneys for the plaintiffs.Richard Boardman, the lawyer representing the claimants, told CNN Sport that this is causing an “existential threat” to the game.CNN has reached out to the International Rugby League Limited and British Amateur Rugby League Association for comment about the lawsuits.The Rugby Football League Limited told CNN in a statement that “while there is an element of risk to playing any sport, player welfare is always of paramount importance.“As a result of scientific knowledge, the sport of Rugby League continues to improve and develop its approach to concussion, head injury assessment, education, management and prevention across the whole game,” the league added.In a joint statement sent to CNN Sport, World Rugby, the RFU and WRU said they could not comment on the ongoing legal proceedings.“Player welfare has been and will continue to be our top priority and we constantly strive to safeguard our players, acting on the science and evidence, enacting our six-point plan to make rugby the most progressive sport in the world in this area,” they said.The organizations noted that the sport’s Head Injury Assessment (HIA) during games, which follow a three-stage process to assist with the identification, diagnosis and management of head impact events with the potential for a concussion – are 90% accurate when diagnosing a concussion, citing a paper published in the Springer scientific journal.But experts warn that such protocols don’t really address the issue of playing collision-based sports and repeated head trauma.“As far as the brain is concerned, it doesn’t matter what sport is played,” Michael Grey, a neuroscientist at the University of East Anglia, told CNN Sport. “If we get a knock to the body that causes a wobble of the brain inside the cranium, that’s going to produce some damage.”Chris Nowinski, an advisor to the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) and founding CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation told CNN Sport that head injury protocols need to go beyond treating concussion.“There’s a very straight linear correlation between head impacts and CTE. And there’s studies that will suggest for every one concussion the American football player suffers, they’ll have 300 hits that are harder than that concussion,” he said.Nowinski, a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) wrestler turned neuroscientist, explains that because the brain doesn’t have pain nerves, a person can’t necessarily feel when it’s being damaged, and therefore, most brain injuries don’t produce the symptoms that would be detected by a HIA.Nowinski told CNN Sport that in most professional sports, head injury protocols are “not designed to be safe: they’re designed to allow the business of the game to move forward in a way that is agreeable for the players.”Ann McKee, director of the Boston University CTE Center has also previously told CNN Sport that “subclinical hits – the non-concussive injuries that aren’t detected – you don’t pull the player off the field, and they can be in the hundreds or even the thousands in a single season.”Boardman, who is representing the rugby claimants, told CNN Sport: “We believe that up to 50% of elite players that play post 1995, when the sport went professional, will end up with some kind of neurological impairment.”Rugby is split into two main codes, rugby league and rugby union, which went professional in 1995. Since the sport went professional, players have become stronger, bigger and faster. In 1955, mean male player body mass was 84.8 kilograms (about 187 pounds). By 2015, it had increased by 24.3% to 105.4 kilograms (232 pounds), according to a study published in the British Medical Journal Open Sport & Exercise Medicine.The rugby lawsuit comes a decade after the NFL reached a $765 million settlement in a case involving more than 4,500 players who accused the league of failing to warn and protect them from the long-term risks of repetitive traumatic brain injuries, despite being aware of the evidence and associated risks.The NFL denied any wrongdoing, but according to NFL.com, commissioner Roger Goodell told lawyers to “do the right thing for the game and the men who played it.”To date, NFL parties have paid out over $1 billion in monetary awards as part of the program.The agreement provides up to $5 million per retired player for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma.The NFL publicly acknowledged a connection between American football and CTE for the first time in 2016.Boardman told CNN Sport that rugby players face regular head trauma on a scale far greater than those in the NFL, given that more games are played and contact in training is not limited like it is in American football.“That’s why we believe rugby is on a scale unlike NFL, unlike football [soccer], any other contact sport,” he said.Grey, the neuroscientist, says that many sports governing bodies – including rugby – continue to distance themselves from CTE. World Rugby denies this, saying in a statement that it “constantly reviews all of the available evidence and our track record consistently shows that we follow the latest scientific data and expert opinion.”Their attitude, Grey says, resembles: “It’s not our problem. It’s American football. It’s ice hockey. It’s these high-impact sports that have the problem. Well, we know now that’s not true.”“They’ve taken a very, very long time to get on board with the notion that we need to reduce the incidence of injury in practice and in play. And they’ve really come along with this kicking and screaming,” he said.“It’s the business of the game that seems to be far more important than the player welfare,” Grey adds.McKee tells CNN Sport that, when it comes to sports leagues and head injury, “there’s a generalized denial that it’s an issue.”A new study from the University of Glasgow, Boston University and the University of Sydney which looked at the post-mortem brain exams of 31 former amateur and elite rugby union players found CTE in 68% of the brains, which had been donated for research purposes.Researchers found that the risk of CTE pathology was associated with the length of a player’s career, noting that each additional year of play added 14% to the risk of CTE – regardless of whether a player was amateur or elite and their position or level of participation. The men whose brains were donated for study had an average rugby career length of around 18 years.And in a 2022 study from the University of Glasgow, researchers found the risk of developing neurodegenerative disease later in life among former Scottish international rugby union players was nearly triple that of people with the same socio-demographic profile.The paper, which looked at 412 Scottish former international male rugby players aged 30 and above and 1,236 members of the public who had been matched for age, sex and socioeconomic status, found that the rugby players’ risk of a dementia diagnosis over time was just over twice as high.Meanwhile, their risk of developing Parkinson’s disease by the time of a follow-up with researchers was three times as high, and that of motor neurone disease (MND) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 15 times as high.World Rugby noted that its concussion protocols have evolved and have been revised in 2012, 2014, 2019, 2021 and 2022 to increase substitution time and adapt tests for concussion.“The temporary substitution time period has proven successful in assisting medical staff to assess and make an informed decision regarding the removal of players when suspected concussion is not clear,” states World Rugby on its site.“The entire process includes strict side-line assessment based on the best available evidence and rigid follow-up procedures.”And, in October, World Rugby announced it will advance the Head Injury Assessment (HIA) by introducing in-game alerts linked to smart mouthguards “to show if a player has experienced a high level of acceleration which could lead to an injury.”However, Woodard and Popham, the former rugby players, both point out that there is a pressure to carry on playing even after having sustained a head injury.In the late 90s and early 2000s, “unless your leg was hanging off, you were encouraged to stay on regardless of what happened,” Woodard explains.“That stigma still exists to a certain extent today, although it’s been radically improved in the last 10 years or so.”Popham adds: “Rugby players, they’re gladiators – especially at the moment with a shortage of clubs and jobs out there – they don’t want to miss a game because they’re fighting until their next contract … But it needs to be taken out of the players’ hands.”Many fans believe that the same players who are seeking compensation have the potential to ruin the sport, according to Woodward and Popham.“There’s a lot of people who are judging us because they think we’re attacking the game. And what we’re actually trying to do is make the game safer,” Woodard explains.“People are going to comment on this, things like: ‘My mom had dementia, and she never had any compensation,’ stuff like that. Your mom was diagnosed at 70. I’m in my early 40s. There’s a huge difference.”Woodard says he is now dealing with a steep decline in his cognitive function.“When I go back up to Wales to pick my children up, if I want to take them to a park or a trampoline park or something of interest to them, I can’t compute how to get there, even though I lived in Wales for over 40 years of my life,” he says. “Whereas five years ago, I could do it perfectly.”Both men are adamant that more needs to be done to protect future and current players.Popham says that this doesn’t just extend to the professional game, with children playing the sport every day.“Parents aren’t told this. My mom broke down when I got my diagnosis, saying she shouldn’t have sent me to rugby. I said, ‘You weren’t told, you weren’t informed.’ And that’s still the case to this day. I don’t think parents are told the correct information on this issue.”Governing bodies England Rugby and Welsh Rugby Union have codes of practice indicating how contact in youth rugby should be managed by coaches, and which age groups can play together.The latest study from Boston University’s CTE Center shows “that CTE can start in very young athletes who only play amateur sports,” said McKee, co-author of the study, said of the paper published in the journal JAMA Neurology.The study of 152 brains from athletes who were under 30 at the time of their death discovered more than 60 cases of CTE, with the youngest person diagnosed with CTE in the study only 17.The majority of those diagnosed were amateur athletes who played sports including soccer, football, ice hockey, rugby and amateur and professional wrestling at the youth, high school and collegiate levels.Woodard says that he has seen other former players in their 40s start to deteriorate and is aware that men in his cohort have died by suicide or been institutionalized for mental health conditions.“Psychologically, I try not to think about it. The way I’ve decided to approach this is: the serious decline might never happen.”Woodard adds he accepts that, in 10 or 15 years, he might be unable to care for himself and have to be admitted to a care home.Still, he says, when he hears of suicides and mental health issues in players of his age or from his cohort, “you can get yourself in a whole spiral of doom.”Experts are clear that they don’t want to discourage people from playing sports.“We could be getting people off the pitch when we recognize they are concussed. And we should be teaching players about the dangers of concussion,” said Grey.Nowinski, the NFLPA advisor, adds: “With all the reforms the NFL has made, it has never been more profitable and more popular than it is today.“Hopefully, the lesson for rugby here is: you can make radical changes to the game, to make it safer, more ethical and protect the next generation.”"

        "title": "‘Math is hard I guess’: Jordan Spieth’s disqualification reignites ‘dumbest rule in all of sports’ debate",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "With just one errant stroke, Jordan Spieth was out of the tournament. Not with the stroke of his club though, but of his pen.After making a promising start at The Genesis Invitational, the American saw his pursuit of a 14th PGA Tour title ended prematurely when he was disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard following the second round in California last week.The transgression could be traced back to the par-three fourth hole at Riviera Country Club, when Spieth tapped home for his first bogey of the day. Three more would follow, as well as a painful closing double-bogey, as the three-time major winner followed up an excellent opening five-under 66 with a frustrating two-over 73 to slip down the leaderboard.Only, that number wasn’t on the scorecard he handed in – it was signed with a par at the fourth and a 72 overall. The moment Spieth stepped out of the scoring area, his fate was sealed. Under Rule 3.3b (3) of the USGA Rules of Golf, the world No. 13 was disqualified for returning a score lower than his actual score.Spieth accepted his banishment – his first in 263 starts on the PGA Tour – without complaint, taking “full responsibility” for his error after believing he had gone through “all procedures” to make sure his scorecard was correct.“Rules are rules,” he added in his post on X, formerly known as Twitter.A subsequent congratulatory post for Hideki Matsuyama urging the champion to “double check that scorecard” showed an individual who had made peace with his ejection.Others weren’t so sanguine and sections of social media fizzed in a cocktail of bewilderment and fury as news of Spieth’s disqualification spread.Spieth’s fellow pro Michael S. Kim labeled the rule “stupid,” even with “many safeguards,” while PGA Tour caddie Kip Henley lamented “another benchmark in the dumbest rule in all of sports.”“Seriously, why even have scorecards on the PGA Tour?” Henley asked in another post. “Why don’t professional bowlers keep their own scores?”Many of the criticisms echoed the American’s sentiments. At tournaments with automated leaderboards, a myriad of TV cameras and a near-endless output of shot-by-shot data, why – some questioned – the need for such a seemingly rudimentary scoring method?“Why are we still doing this guys?” asked two-time DP World Tour winner Eddie Pepperell.“Nobody benefits from this. R&A [and] USGA, can we please look at changing this rule to a softer penalty please?”However, not all are so keen to see the rule ripped up. World No. 174 Dylan Wu likened signing an incorrect scorecard to “forgetting to write your name down on a test.”“Amazes me how often this happens in pro golf. Math is hard I guess,” posted Wu. “Takes 5 seconds for the Tour officials to read your scores back and for you to check them.”Under the USGA Rules of Golf, applied to every level of golf competition, players are responsible for keeping track of their score during a round.The player does not have to be the scorecard marker, it could be a fellow competitor and (or) a walking scorer, but they assume the responsibility of checking the scores and raising any issues to tournament officials.Curiously, had Spieth handed in a score higher than he actually shot – i.e. a double bogey at the fourth hole and a 74 overall – it would have stood and he would not have been disqualified. USGA rules do not disqualify players for returning a score higher than their actual score, only those returned that are lower.This technicality cost Roberto De Vicenzo his shot at The Masters in 1968, when playing partner Tommy Aaron incorrectly recorded one of the Argentinian’s final round birdies as a par.Not seeing the error, De Vicenzo – set to duel co-leader Bob Goalby in a winner-takes-all playoff the following day – signed the scorecard and instantly sealed Goalby his first and only major title in the most bizarre of circumstances.Nothing so infamous has transpired in the decades since, yet incidents do occasionally occur.Reigning US Open winner Wyndham Clark was disqualified from the 2019 Players Championship for signing an incorrect scorecard, while Carlota Ciganda suffered the same fate at last year’s Evian Championship.Ciganda’s ejection was slightly more complex: hit with a two-shot penalty for slow pace of play at the major, the Spaniard refused to add it to her scorecard after her appeal was denied by rules officials.The PGA Tour, in accordance with USGA guidelines, follows a multi-step process to check the scorecards of fields peaking at 156-strong. Presently, there are no plans to address the ruling, a spokesperson for the Tour told CNN Sport.“The situation with Spieth was extremely rare,” they added. “There is a lot of technology used at PGA Tour events as it relates to scoring but all of it includes a human element (walking scorers, volunteers, scoring officials).”CNN has reached out to the USGA for comment.The tour’s current stance falls in line with world No. 3 Rory McIlroy’s “traditionalist” position, who said he did not see the need to change the ruling if it has “worked for so long.”Even so, the Northern Irishman expressed his sympathy for Spieth at an error “easily done” when leaving the course frustrated and admitted to understanding questions around the ruling.“If we’re really trying to keep this game un-bifurcated, the pros playing by the same rules as the amateurs, then we all need to keep our playing partners’ scorecards and we’re responsible for that,” McIlroy, who finished tied-24th, told reporters after his third round.“But I also see the other side of the coin where there’s thousands of people watching us, every shot’s tracked on Shot Tracker and on the PGA Tour app, so is it really needed at this point? I can see both sides of the argument.”Spieth’s compatriot Xander Schauffele echoed that the rule was “part of the tradition of the game.”“Jordan knows what happened … I heard he had to go to the restroom and came back like a minute later and the card was wrong,” Schauffele told reporters.“Maybe, there needs to be some sort of softening on the rules, but for the most part, we all kind of know what goes on in there. It’s really unfortunate it happened.”World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler explained his own process for avoiding such a mishap. After checking his score, the American stands by – caddie in tow – as a rules official logs his scores into a computer in case an inconsistency is flagged.“I think the rule was originally in there to protect the integrity of the game,” Scheffler said, according to NBC Sports.“I guess you have to have some sort of punishment to avoid [anything nefarious] happening.”“The rule is a ridiculous outdated relic at the top level of the sport,” Golf Digest writer Luke Kerr-Dineen told CNN.“Keeping your own score in golf is a means to an end: the only solution for the countless tournaments that take place at the recreational level and one designed for the professional game during an era before indoor plumbing had become the norm. It made sense then.“But Jordan Spieth is playing golf on national television, with in-depth data tracking his every shot. His correct score was easily verifiable in a number of ways. To throw him out of the tournament, no questions asked, over a literal clerical error violates the basic rule of common sense.”Scores should be corrected, with a playing partner’s approval, if they can be verified by a different “tournament-approved” method such as Shot Link – the PGA Tour technology implemented in 1983 that captures real-time shot data – or TV broadcast, Kerr-Dineen suggested.Kerr-Dineen’s Golf Digest colleague Joel Beall, however, remains firmly in the camp of ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ “Spieth was the aberration that proved the rule is correct,” he explained.“It’s not a dumb rule,” Beall told CNN Sport. “This is not other sports, where there is one scorer for one game played at the same time.“Most professional golf tournaments are run by volunteers, and with thousands of shots being hit a day, and such a low percentage of those shots are captured by video.“Maintaining your score is integral to golf’s ethos of being a game of honor, and there are countless stories from tours around the world of manipulation of scorecards to underline its importance.“There are a ton of archaic rules in golf, but this isn’t one of them.”"

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Kamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.Kamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.It will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.Kamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.Describing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”Using a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”Kamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.Qatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.He says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.A Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”The official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.With the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.The Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.The report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.Hassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.A government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”It has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.Eight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.Since 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.However, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”Last year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.We are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.Hari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).After moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”During his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.He added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”Working long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.In 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.The government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”Natasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”Determining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”According to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.In its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.The statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”Amnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”Barun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”Last year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”Iskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”Knight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”For the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.His friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.Now, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.Sunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.He had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”In helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”He says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.For a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”The SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.Since 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.Qatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.The spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.Such attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.In Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”Knight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”Ghimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.Qatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”Human Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.Families of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”Ghimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”Earlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.A Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.In terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.Last month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”It has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.FIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.The motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.As NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”Hosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza."

        "title": "Simona Halep: Two-time grand slam champion cleared for tennis return as four-year doping ban reduced",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Former tennis world No. 1 Simona Halep has been cleared to return to the sport after having a backdated four-year ban reduced to nine months, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) announced Tuesday.The two-time grand slam winner was handed the ban in September 2023 after being found guilty of anti-doping rule violations by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) Independent Tribunal.“The CAS Panel has unanimously determined that the four-year period of ineligibility imposed by the ITF Independent Tribunal is to be reduced to a period of ineligibility of nine months starting on 7 October 2022, which period expired on 6 July 2023,” CAS said in a media release released Tuesday.In the media release, the CAS Panel stated that Halep’s “anti-doping rule violations were not intentional.”Halep said she cannot wait to return to the tour after the “truth prevailed.”“Throughout this long and difficult process, I have maintained my belief that the truth would eventually come out, and that a just decision would be reached, because I am and always have been a clean athlete,” Halep said in a statement obtained by CNN.“My faith in the process was tested by the scandalous accusations that were leveled against me, and by the seemingly unlimited resources that were aligned against me. But in the end, the truth prevailed, even if it took much longer than I wish it had.”Halep tested positive for banned substance Roxadustat at the at the 2022 US Open.“Having carefully considered all the evidence put before it, the CAS Panel determined that Ms. Halep had established, on the balance of probabilities, that the Roxadustat entered her body through the consumption of a contaminated supplement which she had used in the days shortly before 29 August 2022 and that the Roxadustat, as detected in her sample, came from that contaminated product.“As a result, the CAS Panel determined that Ms. Halep had also established, on the balance of probabilities, that her anti-doping rule violations were not intentional.”Roxadustat is listed on the 2022 World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List. According to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), it is a class of drug called HIF-stabilizing agents and can increase an athlete’s red blood cell count and boost endurance performance.The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) also announced in September that Halep was being charged with having irregularities in her Athlete Biological Passport (ABP), which is designed to monitor an athlete’s selected biological variables over time. CAS dismissed that charge.Before the CAS ruling on Tuesday, the ITIA had said that Halep’s suspension would run from October 7, 2022, until October 6, 2026.“An essential element of the anti-doping process is a player’s ability to appeal, and the ITIA respects both their right to do so, and the outcome,” ITIA CEO Karen Moorhouse said on Tuesday.“We await the full reasoned decision and will review it thoroughly in due course.”CNN’s George Ramsay and Jill Martin contributed to this report."

        "title": "‘Relief from everyday life’: How soccer is helping Ukrainian soldiers who have lost limbs in the war against Russia",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Breathing heavily, Oleksandr Malchevsky puts on his prosthesis and hurries home to his wife and son. The 39-year-old has just lost a soccer game, but he isn’t too upset. For him, the sport is more than just a game – it’s about helping his rehabilitation as he adjusts to civilian life.Malchevsky is a Ukrainian soldier who lost part of his leg fighting in Eastern Ukraine. He voluntarily joined the army when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and served as a gunner. Last year in the Kharkiv region, he came under mortar fire and was seriously injured. The doctors saved his left leg but had to amputate part of his right limb.After a year of painful rehabilitation, Malchevsky returned to Kyiv – his native city – and joined the soccer team with other soldiers who had lost limbs fighting for Ukraine.“All my life, I played football in this stadium. When I returned with an injury from the frontline, I was unsure what to do. I joined the team, and I have to say that I’m happy. Here I get a moral relief from everyday life,” Malchevsky, who was discharged from the army for health reasons, told CNN Sport.Amputees, both civilians and soldiers, play football at the small Bannikov Stadium in the center of Kyiv every Thursday. The sessions normally run for two hours and allow the amputees to practice skills, perform strength and conditioning exercises and play games.The Ukrainian Football Federation organized this initiative a few months ago to support soldiers who lost limbs and help their rehabilitation and return to normal life. There are both men and women. Some of them were injured after the 2022 invasion, while others lost limbs following the start of the war in Ukraine in 2014.Reportedly over 20,000 Ukrainians have needed amputations since the war began in February 2022. The coach in charge of Thursday’s session is Dmytro Rzondkovsky. He says there are not many people playing at the moment, but he hopes more will come.“I think football provides psychological support, first of all,” Rzondkovsky, who is also the coach of the Ukrainian amputee football team, told CNN.“Here, these people find new friends and communication. I was really surprised by how much these people love life, football, and sports. This love of life is something I’m still learning from them.”Rzondkovsky is a professional football coach and has a UEFA B license qualification. UEFA is European soccer’s governing body.Even though Thursday’s session doesn’t involve professional players, this project is important for him. He sees the physical pain of the players but tries to support them by showing that they can be a big part of the sport.Some of these soldiers participated in the premier competitions of the League of Nations of the European Football Federation among teams formed from players with limb amputations.In October, the Ukrainian team took second place, defeating the national teams of Greece (2-1) and Belgium (1-0), and also shared points in goalless matches with the teams of Georgia and Israel.“I’m really proud to coach these people,” added Rzondkovsky. “I’m not only their coach. I’m their friend. We are joking a lot during the breaks. It’s a very good atmosphere here.“Thanks to football, they seem to come back to life after the war. In my opinion, rehabilitation through sport, through football, is the best, most effective rehabilitation that can exist.”There is plenty of humor and support among the amputees during the Thursday game that CNN watches.“It was harder on the frontline,” says 32-year-old Roman Lyndov, who plays as a goalkeeper at this game. He lost his left hand in February 2014 at the beginning of the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine, also known as Euromaidan, when something exploded near him.For Lyndov, spending evenings on the field is much better than lounging on the sofa. “This game is more about the character. We are here to win,” he says.Another player is 31-year-old veteran Olha Benda. The mother of two boys, Benda lost part of her left hand in 2017.She was the senior cook at the 72nd Mechanized Brigade. In 2017, with her unit, she was in positions in Avdiivka, eastern Ukraine.She was sleeping in her room when shelling started. When the first explosion happened, Benda fell out of bed. After the second explosion, she was stuck under the rubble and then passed out.There were about 10 Ukrainian soldiers at that location, but she was the only one who was seriously injured.It’s her first training session in Kyiv. Before this, she had been to Poland to watch women’s games and also train. She plans to join the Ukrainian women’s amputee soccer team, which is just being formed. She gets tired faster than the men but doesn’t stop playing, even when out of breath.“I don’t want to be last, I want to be on the same level as the men,” Beneda told CNN. “That’s why I don’t give up. I don’t want to sit in one place; I want to always be on the move and keep my body in good physical shape.“I need to set an example for my sons,” explains Beneda, adding that her nine-year-old son is waiting for her at home and keeps asking her when she is going to start playing soccer with him.Andriy, 42, is also at Thursday’s session. An infantryman, in charge of a rocket launcher, Andriy lost his left hand after being hit by a shell a few months ago in the Donetsk region.He recently was fitted with a prosthetic but is currently on sick leave and has medical boards ahead of him. In the meantime, he dreams about the possibility of peace.Malchevsky, who returned to the company where he had worked before the invasion as an electrical engineering analyst, says he plays not only for himself but also for his family.“I have to take care of myself. I don’t want to be pushed around in a wheelchair in five years. I don’t want to ruin the lives of my child, wife and parents,” he reflects."

        "title": "This soccer star has been handed a six-year prison sentence in absentia for trafficking cocaine. He’s still playing",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "He’s seemingly led an extraordinary double life. Quincy Promes is a successful soccer star, playing as forward with major European clubs Ajax and Sevilla and now Spartak Moscow, as well as representing the Netherlands at the international level.Promes played 50 times for the Netherlands and, according to the respected website Transfermarkt, at one point in his career had a transfer value of $26 million.Away from the pitch, Promes has recently been convicted for drug trafficking by an Amsterdam court. His conviction comes against the backdrop of the Netherlands’ wider war on drugs.Earlier this month, Dutch prosecutors successfully argued that Promes was central to a drug trafficking operation involved in smuggling some 1,360 kilograms of cocaine from Brazil to the Netherlands through the port of Antwerp in Belgium in 2020, in two separate incidents.“It is particularly bad that the suspect [Promes] normalizes and almost romanticizes the large-scale cocaine trade,” said Dutch prosecutors.“The suspect profiles himself that way to the outside world, while he is an example for young people who look up to him,” the prosecutors added.Promes was convicted in absentia to six years in prison for drug trafficking. It’s a sentence he won’t serve any time soon given given he lives in Russia, playing for Russian Premier League side Spartak Moscow.“The suspect maintained a managerial role and was a financier. He worked calculatedly, was careful and did not take too many risks. He did not get his own hands dirty. He let others do the dirty work,” said prosecutors earlier this month in the case.Lawyers for Promes said he denied the charges, and would be appealing the sentence.“We will further explain our grievances to the Court of Appeal during a yet to be scheduled public hearing,” said Promes’ lawyers in a statement.“Finally, we would like to emphasize that as long as the judge’s verdict is not final, every suspect in the Netherlands must be presumed innocent. This also applies to Mr. Promes.”Last year, Promes was convicted in absentia for stabbing his cousin in the knee, Reuters reported, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison, according to prosecutors.Promes’ contract with Spartak Moscow runs until the end of June 2024, according to Transfermarkt. The Russian club did not respond to CNN’s request for comment as to whether it will continue to play Promes in matches or extend his contract.Criminologist Hans Nelen told CNN that Promes’ case is “remarkable … From the outside, many people are inclined to say: ‘He will earn millions of euros a year…. Why [is he] involved in the drug trade to begin with?’”A professor of criminology at Maastricht University, Nelen says the general public’s reaction to Promes’ situation was one of frustration.“That he’s out and he cannot be arrested and then he cannot be put in jail, and is still playing football,” he said.According to Nelen, Promes posting photos on social media in expensive cars, wearing diamond encrusted jewelry and on luxury holidays to destinations like Dubai, isn’t a great look with the Dutch public.“He’s still putting posts on social media, and he’s pretending that he is untouchable,” added Nelen.CNN has contacted representatives for Promes, offering the soccer player the opportunity to comment on his recent court case, but hadn’t received a reply at the time of publication.Earlier this year, Femke Halsema, the mayor of Amsterdam, warned that Rotterdam – Europe’s largest port – has become a “global transit hub for cocaine,” with more than 22,000 kg of the drug seized in the first half of 2022 compared with 29,702 kg in the first half of 2023 in spite of authorities’ efforts to take on trafficking. Dutch Customs seized almost 60,000 kg of cocaine in 2023, the Dutch government reported.Halsema, along with the mayor of Rotterdam, said that more must be done to address drug crime, warning in a 2022 letter to the House of Representatives of “a criminal culture of violence” gripping the country.The country’s Multidisciplinary Intervention Team was rebranded that same year as the National Alliance against Subversive Crime (NASC), with its mission “to expose and untangle the financial and other interconnectedness of the underworld and mainstream society,” according to the Dutch government.Concern over drug-related crime in the Netherlands has risen in recent years. In 2021, Dutch crime journalist Peter R. de Vries, known for his investigative work exposing the criminal underworld, was gunned down on a busy central Amsterdam street.“We cannot deny that the drug trade and drug trafficking in general has become a huge issue during the last decade,” said Nelen, though the criminologist adds that “when you think about employment between the drug economy and the legitimate economy, corruption and political influences, I would say that’s rather limited.”“It’s not such a case like Mexico or Columbia or to a certain extent Italy, that somehow our legitimate economy or political system has been completely infiltrated by criminals,” he explained.Still, the Netherlands is a key destination for drug traffickers because it is home to several large ports and borders Germany and Belgium, so it’s a “gateway to Europe,” according to Nelen.Though Promes’ conviction is certainly one of the highest-profile cases in the country in recent years, Nelen said that the Netherlands has seen other attention-grabbing cases of celebrities’ involvement in the illegal drugs trade, including martial arts professionals and kickboxers.Dutchman David Endt, who has worked as a journalist and with Dutch clubs in organizational roles and is now a soccer agent, told CNN that he knew a very different Promes in the early stages of his soccer career.“There was a very pleasant guy there, always – big laugh on his face, did nobody really any harm, and suddenly [he] came into a spiral and then it goes down and down,” said Endt, adding that he hasn’t had contact with Promes for more than 10 years.“The problem with being instantly famous … It’s hard to make the right choices with so-called friends, you attract a lot of people who have bad intentions,” added Endt.And Dutch soccer clubs seem to be taking notice.“Some football clubs are now aware of this and using retired police officers or other coaches to talk to kids who are already 14, 15, 16 years old, who are very talented, to warn them of some of the dangers and some of the risks that may come across. So there are indeed preventative measures taken by some of the clubs,” Nelen adds.Endt, who worked with Ajax in an organizational role for 20 years, told CNN: “After some incidents, smaller ones, bigger ones, we got help from police officers, who sometimes came to the club and they explained the problems young players, or maybe also older players can meet, especially in this social media world.”CNN has reached out to Ajax for further comment.The youth development system for soccer players in the Netherlands is impressive, according to Endt.“There’s also always attention to be aware of your responsibilities not only to yourself, or your teammates, but also in view of the world around you, that you have to behave well, that a good player is also an example in life. But not everybody is following this, obviously.”"

        "title": "‘He is not a liar:’ Max Verstappen defends his outspoken father amid Christian Horner controversy",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Formula One world champion Max Verstappen has defended his father Jos after he weighed in on the Christian Horner controversy which has overshadowed Red Bull’s start to the new season.The father of the three-time F1 world champion criticized Red Bull’s decision to keep Horner in his role, saying “the team is in danger of being torn apart” following allegations that the team principal engaged in inappropriate behavior towards a member of the racing team.“My dad, from how I know him in go-karting, is very outspoken and he is not a liar, that is for sure,” Verstappen said, per Reuters, ahead of this weekend’s Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.“My dad and I are very close. We call every day.”Following Jos Verstappen comments, Red Bull said in a statement sent to CNN on Monday: “This is untrue. We are united as a team and we are concentrating on racing.”Horner was cleared of wrongdoing last week and reiterated that he denied the allegations on Friday after alleged leaked messages were distributed to members of the F1 community on Thursday in a Google Drive. CNN has been unable to corroborate their authenticity.In a statement, regarding the mass email, Red Bull told CNN: “This is a private matter between Mr. Horner and another and it would be inappropriate for Red Bull to comment on this.”In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, Jos Verstappen denied being the source behind the leaked messages. “But why would I do that? Max has a contract with Red Bull until 2028, is performing great and feels at home here. I have no interest in that at all.”Following Verstappen’s victory in the season-opening race at the Bahrain Grand Prix, in which Horner was present with his wife Geri Halliwell, Verstappen’s father told The Daily Mail that “there is tension while he remains in position.”He added: “It can’t go on the way it is. It will explode. He is playing the victim, when he is the one causing the problems.”The apparent rift between Horner and Verstappen’s father has led many to question whether the Dutch driver will remain in his seat past this season.“Things must go really crazy, I guess, but that’s not the target for everyone,” said Verstappen, when asked if he might not be racing for Red Bull next year.“I’m just focusing on the driving bit and I think that is also the most important for the team right now.“That’s also why we came here and that’s our main target and what we want to focus on you know, to not have this stuff going on race after race because that is not good for the team.”Verstappen coasted to victory in the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday, laying down an ominous marker for the rest of the field in the opening race of this F1 season.The win dispelled any notions, for now, that Red Bull’s dominance might have waned over the winter or that its preparations were significantly disrupted by an external investigation.Verstappen, and Red Bull, will hope the positive results on the track will continue at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on Saturday.Vertappen’s father is not expected to attend the race this weekend due to a prior commitment, according to the BBC."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "A swimmer’s disqualification on a technicality after winning a college conference final has led to one teammate branding the decision as the “dumbest rule in swimming.”Owen Lloyd, a senior at North Carolina State University, clinched the 1,650-yard freestyle title at the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Championships at the end of February, but was promptly stripped of his title after climbing into the adjacent lane to celebrate with teammate Ross Dant, who finished in second, before the other swimmers had touched the wall.The meet’s head referee implemented Rule 2, Section 5 of the NCAA rulebook, which states that “a swimmer who changes lanes during a heat shall be disqualified,” leading to Lloyd’s disqualification.CNN reached out to NC State, who deferred to the ACC, and the NCAA for comment.Winning the ACC Championship title would have booked Lloyd a spot at the NCAA Championships in the event.“I think that’s the dumbest rule in swimming,” Dant told the ACC Network. “Owen beat me fair and square, he should be on that podium. He was excited. That’s a huge win for him, right? He earned that. He earned that, and that’s his emotion.“That’s what we get in the sport of swimming when we do well. We train all year for a moment like that, and to have him disqualified I think is the dumbest thing ever. He works so hard every day. He is going to be on that No. 1 trophy. I am not going to stand up there.“I think the rule makes sense if you’re interfering with a swimmer that is still racing,” Dant added to The Athletic. “But there should be a caveat to the rule where it’s ‘not interfering with a swimmer’s ability to complete the race’ or something like that.“He didn’t interfere with my lane because I was already done, and everyone else around us was done as well. Him getting into my lane would not have affected the person in lane six.”Lloyd was visibly distraught by the decision, sitting by the side of the pool in tears after the decision was announced over the speaker system.“I just started crying because I was so upset that all that hard work had been kind of taken away from me by such a strange situation,” Lloyd told The Athletic.“That was a huge moment for me to become an ACC champion after really kind of climbing up the ranks throughout the team, throughout the conference and nationally, as well. I’ve seen people get on the lane line before and I didn’t think twice about it when I did it there.“It happened to be unfortunate that in the mile, where there’s the opportunity to pull ahead farther, that someone was still swimming. That did not cross my mind at all that potentially I’d be disrespecting them or showing emotion that I shouldn’t while they were still racing. I was kind of just letting it flow.”Dant later handed the first-place medal to Lloyd in the stands, according to The Athletic, with Lloyd saying the ACC Championship title is now in his bedroom.The incident has drawn widespread criticism, with Fox reporter Will Kunkel calling the decision “outrageous.”“Can we not have some discretion here?” he asked on X. “This is so sad and stupid.”Amy Van Dyken-Rouen, who was the color commentator for the race, questioned why the referee didn’t appear to be enforcing rules as rigorously in other races.“I am a rule follower,” she said in a video posted to X, formerly Twitter. “I love a rule because I love to follow it – my problem with this whole thing has been: if you’re going to call that, you need to call everything.“Not five minutes after all this hot mess happened, there were backstrokers that were diving into the pool. Why is that a problem? The rule states backstrokers must enter feet first.“So if you called Owen Lloyd for celebrating and ‘interfering’ – which he did not – you gotta call the backstrokers for diving in, which you did not. So if you’re going to call one, you call them all. That has been my problem with this whole thing.”The 2024 NCAA Division 1 championships will take place at IU Natatorium in Indianapolis, between March 27 and 30."

        "title": "Rex Chapman is glad to ‘be on the other side’ of drug and gambling addiction",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Former college and pro basketball player Rex Chapman is now a social media influencer and popular podcaster, but in between those accomplishments, he developed a drug and gambling addiction and was arrested for shoplifting.“Sports and addiction kind of go hand-in-hand because most people that do anything just really great in this lifetime, no matter what it is … Most of those people have sacrificed a little bit of sanity to get there,” the 56-year-old Chapman told CNN in a recent interview.The former Charlotte Hornet and Phoenix Suns player’s new autobiography, “It’s Hard for Me to Live with Me,” co-written with CBS Sports’ Seth Davis, covers all of Chapman’s highs and lows.Some of the stories in Chapman’s book will be familiar to his more than one million social media followers; he writes about debilitating bouts with anxiety and depression and his struggle with an opioid and gambling addiction.Many revelations though are new. Chapman shares tender passages such as holding teammate Dell Curry’s baby, future NBA superstar Steph Curry, and knowing that he wanted to be a father to a brutally sobering memory of waking up after crashing his car into a ditch during a drug-induced blackout on the way to rehab.“One day, the pills start telling you when to take it instead of the other way around,” said Chapman. “All of a sudden, you’re not looking at the watch and going, ‘Oh, I should take this again.’ It’s telling you [that] you need it. And now, you’re screwed.”Chapman traces the start of his problems back to an early struggle with crippling anxiety.In the book, he details how he once vomited on the court in front of his father Wayne – a former ABA player – and how that one moment led to a career-long habit of throwing up before every game for the rest of his career.At the University of Kentucky in the mid-to-late 80s, he was known as “King Rex,” but he writes that an interracial relationship he was in was frowned upon by some in the university community, leading to a general malaise about everything and, eventually, panic attacks.Despite those college challenges, Chapman was a first-round draft pick in 1988 and played 12 years in the NBA.After what he described as a routine surgery, Chapman developed an opioid addiction and, at one point, was taking up to 50 painkillers a day.He says the drug addiction was a gateway to a gambling addiction which cost him nearly all of the $40 million he earned during his career.“It’s on me … I had a huge pride problem, you know, and I know a lot of professional athletes are very stubborn and whatnot,” said Chapman.“But you know, I wasn’t gonna reach out to anybody. I had plenty of friends I could have told, ‘Look, I’m not doing well, emotionally, mentally …’ Whatever it was, I wouldn’t do that.”Chapman says he hit rock bottom in 2014 when he was living in his El Camino. After his arrest for shoplifting, he entered rehab three separate times before sobriety stuck. He credits family and friends for not giving up on him.“I’m lucky to have so many people that I crossed paths with throughout my life. [And that] once I was able to get clean, there were people willing to give me opportunities,” Chapman told CNN.“I have so many. My family, my sister, my parents, my cousin and close friends from childhood … [I’m] fortunate in that regard because a lot of addicts aren’t as fortunate.”He considers his book a personal mea culpa in which he takes responsibility and offers insight into his success, his struggles and how he moves forward.Now that he’s clean, Chapman says he’s dedicated to being a good father to his son and three daughters.“I struggle just like most people do, I think, but [I’m glad] to kind of be on the other side of the drug stuff and getting to know [my children] as adults, young adults [which] is just amazing. I’m just really fortunate that my kids love me, and they let me know that.”The book is dedicated to his four children as well as people struggling with drug addiction who he has become an advocate for. If Chapman’s go-to motto is “life is hard,” he believes his journey has been also inherently complex and beautiful.“Once I finished playing, a good friend of mine, John Lucas, said, ‘You know, every athlete dies twice. Once when they finish playing and then life.’ I didn’t really understand it then, but it’s very true,” reflects the former NBA star.“It’s Hard for Me to Live With Me” is published by Simon and Schuster and Rex Chapman can be heard weekly on his podcast “Owned” by Smartless Media."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Spain’s LaLiga says it is “studying and analyzing the facts” around the latest alleged racist abuse incident towards Real Madrid forward Vinícius Jr. at Valencia’s Mestalla Stadium on Saturday.This comes after a video obtained by ESPN and widely circulated online shows a child yelling “monkey” in Spanish allegedly towards the Brazilian forward, Anna Anjos – who shot the video – told ESPN after the match.Vinícius scored twice in the 2-2 draw at Valencia.LaLiga cannot impose punishments on clubs or fans itself. Instead, it must report incidents to the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) committees or regional prosecutors who then deal with them as legal cases before sporting punishments are handed out.But LaLiga told CNN Sport on Monday that it was “studying and analyzing the facts from a legal perspective to determine what we can/should do, as [the incident] involves a minor.”In Spain, it is illegal to publish or upload video of a minor, under 14 years old, without parental consent, according to the country’s Protection of Personal Data law of 2018.It is unclear how old the child in the blurred video is.It is also unclear if a criminal investigation is underway. CNN has reached out to Valencia’s local prosecutor for comment.Anjos told ESPN after the game that she heard fans call Vinícius a “mono” (monkey in Spanish) several times and that she felt “extremely threatened” and “powerless” in the situation.“From the beginning of the game, since I arrived at the stadium, I heard people offend Vini … [racially insulting him] all the time,” Anjos added.“After the game, I cried. I don’t know if you can tell from my face, but I cried a lot because I felt powerless.”Vinícius has been subjected to racist abuse from the stands on numerous occasions during LaLiga matches over the past two seasons. He was also the target of racist abuse in Real’s league game at Valencia last season.In late May 2023, Spanish police said seven people had been detained in relation to incidents of racist abuse directed at Vinícius. Four young men had been detained for allegedly hanging an effigy of Vinícius off a bridge in Madrid in January, while three others were arrested on suspicion of being involved in racist insults aimed at the Brazilian on May 21 of the same year.Following the match this Saturday, Vinícius posted an image of himself on social media with a raised fist and captioned it “A luta continua,” which means “the struggle continues” in English.CNN has reached out to RFEF, Real Madrid and Valencia for comment.In a separate incident after the match, Peter Federico, a Real Madrid player currently on loan to Valencia, was forced to deactivate the comments on his Instagram account due to a flood of racist and abusive messages he was receiving, according to reports in Spanish media.Federico came on in the 73rd minute and had chances to score against his parent club, before attempting to hype up the Mestalla crowd on Saturday. These actions were the focal point of much of the abuse Federico received on his Instagram.Valencia condemned the abusive messages on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying, “Valencia reiterates its dedication in the fight against discrimination in any form. The comments fomenting hate that our player Peter Federico is receiving are totally unacceptable. For a football and society free of discrimination and violence. Zero discrimination.”LaLiga also denounced the abusive messages received by Federico in statement on X on Monday.“In sport, there is no place for acts of hate. LaLiga condemns the discriminatory comments directed at Peter Federico and lends its support, as well as to Valencia. We keep working together to eradicate these behaviors from our football,” the Spanish league said."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "It has been a remarkable week for Russia’s Anna Kalinskaya, who began it having just qualified for the Dubai Tennis Championships and ended it playing in the tournament’s final after defeating world No. 1 Iga Świątek and US Open champion Coco Gauff along the way.By stunning Świątek 6-4 6-4 in the semifinal on Friday, Kalinskaya became just the second-ever qualifier to reach a WTA 1000 final, and the second player to inflict defeat upon the Polish star in her last 26 matches.But she succumbed to Italy’s Jasmine Paolini 4-6 7-5 7-5 in Saturday’s final, the match slipping away after she had served for the title while a break up and leading 5-4 in the deciding set.“(Świątek’s) a great player. I know if I don’t stay calm and aggressive she’s going to destroy me,” Kalinskaya, the world No. 40, said after her semifinal victory, according to Reuters.“That was my plan. To stay aggressive, move her a lot. I’m happy I won. She’s unbelievable. I’m happy I had the chance to play against her. I’m sure we’ll play a lot in the future.”At first, it seemed that Świątek had the upper hand, as she went a break up and edged 4-2 ahead in the first set but Kalinskaya rallied and completed two consecutive breaks to take the lead.The 25-year-old raced into a 5-2 lead in the second set, but wobbled after Świątek saved two match points and mounted a comeback to come within touching distance of leveling the second set.Świątek, however, failed to convert a break point to make it 5-5 and Kalinskaya served out the set to take the win.She had already defeated world No. 3 Coco Gauff 2-6 6-4 6-2 in Thursday’s quarterfinals for another upset victory, making her form all the more impressive.Her run at the Dubai Tennis Championships backs up her breakthrough performance at the Australian Open in which she reached the quarterfinals, despite starting the season ranked world No. 80.That propelled her up the rankings, and she will now rise into the top 30 for a new career-high ranking after her impressive performances in Dubai."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, the night before he was scheduled to face Canadian Milos Raonic in the first round, he announced on social media Wednesday.In an announcement on X, the 22-time Grand Slam winner said he’s dropping out of the tennis tournament because he doesn’t feel prepared enough to compete at “the highest level.” The three-time Indian Wells champion holds a 59-11 record at Indian Wells, according to ATP Tour.“It is with great sadness that I have to withdraw from this amazing tournament at Indian Wells,” Nadal wrote. “Everyone knows how much I love this place and how much I love to play here. That’s also one of the reasons why I came very early to the desert to practice and try to get ready.”The 37-year-old was scheduled to play in the first round against Raonic on Thursday, but Indian player Sumit Nagal has taken Nadal’s place in the draw, a news release said. The BNP Paribas Open runs through March 17 at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.Nadal has not played on the world tour since the Brisbane International in January, where he made a much-awaited comeback after a hip injury. Earlier this week, the fan-favorite participated in the inaugural “Netflix Slam” against compatriot Carlos Alcaraz in Las Vegas. Alcaraz defeated Nadal in the exhibition match.“I have been working hard and practicing and you all know I took a test this weekend but I don’t find myself ready to play at the highest level at such an important event,” Nadal said in the announcement. “It is not an easy decision, it’s a tough one as a matter of fact but I can’t lie to myself and lie to the thousands of fans. I will miss you all and I am sure the tournament will be a great success.”The player has battled a series of injuries in recent years, which caused him to miss several major tournaments. Nadal said in May 2023 that 2024 would likely be his last year on tour, though he didn’t rule out continuing past that date.Tournament director Tommy Haas said he was “disappointed” Nadal would be withdrawing but wished him “continued healing and hope he can be back in action again soon.”“He is one of the all-time fan favorites here, and we hope to see him back in Indian Wells again in the future,” Haas continued."

        "title": "Excluded from the Olympics for his whole career, artistic swimmer Bill May set for ‘beautiful’ debut at this year’s Games",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "For decades, Bill May has dreamed of competing at the Olympics. It’s not athletic ability which has prevented him from achieving that goal to date, but a far more fundamental issue: he’s a man.Until recently, male artistic swimmers have been excluded from competing at the Olympics, though a rule change announced just over a year ago means that May, a 45-year-old veteran of the sport, can finally fulfill his lifelong ambition.“There is nothing in the world that could ever be bad right now,” he tells CNN Sport, understandably elated after the USA’s qualification for this year’s Games in Paris. “Everything is beautiful, amazing, wonderful. We’re going to the Olympics.”Few athletes will be more deserving of their place at this year’s Games, which get underway in July, than May, and few will have had such an onerous, circuitous path to get there.Precisely 20 years ago, with men still banned from artistic swimming, May watched from the side of the pool as the US team won bronze in Athens.He stepped away from the sport after that, joining the Cirque du Soleil in its water production, “O.” That was his life for the next 10 years, at least until his competitive career was handed a lifeline.When male athletes were granted permission to compete at the world championships in 2015, May once again found himself switching lanes. He became the inaugural winner of the mixed duet technical event alongside Christina Jones that year, and is now, finally, set to compete at the pinnacle of his sport.In December 2022, World Aquatics announced that up to two male artistic swimmers from the teams of eight would be able to compete at the Paris Olympics.“This is something that I’ve dreamed of my whole life,” says May. “This is that one more thing to add to my list of dreams that continue to come true.“I feel like my life is a cliché. This sport has given me so much, and now – to have the absolute dream of going to the Olympic Games – this is something that no one in the world could ever pass up, even just to try.”Artistic swimming, known as synchronized swimming before a name change in 2017, has a long and complicated history when it comes to male participation in the sport.Popularized in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, men were an established part of artistic swimming’s formative years.However, male competitors were later seen to be at odds with the sport due to certain physical characteristics: they were heavier, less flexible – finding leg extensions more difficult – and less buoyant than their female counterparts.“We are used to seeing a sport with a lot of grace, a lot of elegance, and there is also a big choreographic component,” Italian artistic swimmer Nicolò Ogliari told CNN Sport in 2021.“It’s a dance in the water. Maybe, we are more used to seeing a woman do these things. But like in classic dance, also in artistic swimming, there are men.”When artistic swimming was first added to the Olympics in 1984, only women were allowed to compete. It has remained that way for the past 40 years, but this year’s competition will mark a seismic moment in the sport’s history.“This is something that comes from our heart, not that comes from a gender,” says May. “I can never rationalize why anyone would keep anyone out.“For one, it keeps the sport from growing. And two, it’s just not fair. It doesn’t represent humanity. It’s not the way that we want to represent sports in our culture.”May, who will focus on his coaching career after this year’s Games, has been described as a “God” of the sport by fellow competitor Giorgio Minisini.The New York native has been involved in artistic swimming since the age of 10, when, after persuasion from his mom, he ended up joining his sister’s classes. He later moved to California, but despite winning a series of national titles, his career was restricted by the lack of opportunities for men at the highest level.Today, May is in the pool between eight and 10 hours each day as he prepares for the Olympics, on top of cross-training, core exercises, flexibility and weight training. In his mind, artistic swimming is one of, if not the most physically demanding sport on the Olympic program.“You have to move like a dancer,” he says. “You have to tumble and include acrobatics like a gymnast or an acrobat; you have to have the endurance of a marathon runner, and you have to do all of these things without breathing and without touching the bottom.“There’s not one sport in the world where you cannot breathe while you do your entire event, along with everything else combined. I really do think that it’s one of the most difficult sports in the world.”A new event – an acrobatic routine – has been added to this year’s artistic swimming program, alongside technical and free routines. Athletes will compete as a team or a duet, with a total of six medals up for grabs.“I feel that we’re going in with the greatest team in the world – the team that works the hardest, the team that has the most drive and determination,” May says about the USA’s chances at this year’s Olympics, having secured a place at the Games via this month’s world championships.“I think the opportunity to get a medal is really strong.”Denied a spot at the Olympics for so long, May harbors no sense of bitterness or regret about male exclusion from artistic swimming events, only gratitude for being able to finish his competitive career on such a spectacular high.“I know that this sport has given me a life beyond anything I could ever imagine,” he says."

        "title": "Anthony Kim mysteriously disappeared from golf 12 years ago. Now LIV Golf has confirmed his return",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "It’s been more than a decade since Anthony Kim teed up a ball at a professional event. Now, a tour that didn’t exist when he left has announced his return from golf’s wilderness.Kim is set to make his first pro start in 12 years at LIV Golf’s third event of the season in Saudi Arabia on Friday, arriving on the circuit as a wildcard, the organization confirmed on Tuesday.“Following a retirement of nearly 12 years, the 38-year-old American will make his official return to professional competition this week at LIV Golf Jeddah, March 1-3 at Royal Greens Golf and Country Club in King Abdullah Economic City, Saudi Arabia,” LIV Golf said in a statement.The tour also confirmed that Kim will compete in all remaining 2024 LIV Golf regular season events, competing points in the league’s individual standings in order to earn a team place in 2025.“After stepping away from the game years ago due to injury, I’m happy to officially announce my return to the world of professional golf,” said Kim. “It’s been a long time coming, and I’m very grateful for all the highs, lows and lessons learned from the first part of my career.“I want to compete with the best players in the world, and I’m on a mission to prove to myself that I can win again. The next step on that journey starts now, and I’m excited to give everything I’ve got this season on the LIV Golf League.”Kim’s imminent return in Jeddah was first reported by NBC Sports’ Rex Hoggard on Saturday, who cited multiple sources that spoke under anonymity as they “were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.”Prior to Kim’s official signing, LIV Golf posted a promotional video on X, formerly known as Twitter, Monday appearing to hint at his comeback. The video does not name Kim, but features shots of a silhouetted golfer overlaid with narration describing a “rebirth.”LIV Golf commissioner Greg Norman later shared the footage, adding: “He oozes incredible talent.”“The world has seen it in the past and now it is an honor as Commissioner of LIV Golf to give the opportunity for this star to be reborn,” Norman continued on X.“Welcome back and to the LIV Golf family mate. The golf world has missed you.”CNN has reached out to LIV Golf for comment.Three-time PGA Tour winner Kim has not been seen at a pro tournament since withdrawing with an injury following the first round of the Wells Fargo Championship in May 2012.The then-26-year-old had been plagued by injuries for much of the season, the latest of several since 2010, withdrawing from the two previous events.He underwent surgery to repair his left Achilles tendon shortly after, a procedure expected to keep him out for up for nine to 12 months, but the years ticked by without any sign of the once-heralded breakout talent, who has made only sporadic appearances in the public eye since.The Los Angeles-born University of Oklahoma star had wasted little time making headlines after turning professional in 2006, finishing in a share of second on his PGA Tour debut at the Valero Texas Open.He delivered four-top 10 finishes during his rookie season the following year, before surging to a dominant five-shot victory at the 2008 Wachovia Championship to clinch his first PGA Tour title and rise to world No. 16.Kim would peak at world No. 6 during a stellar campaign, with highlights including another victory at the Tiger Woods-hosted AT&T National and a starring role as the youngest member of a victorious Team USA at the Ryder Cup in Kentucky.A thumb injury and subsequent surgery hampered his hopes of making the team for the return trip to Europe in 2010, but Kim had delivered more memorable moments before his injury problems proliferated.His 11 birdies in a single round at the 2009 Masters remains a tournament record, while his 2010 Shell Houston Open win made him just the third player to win three times on the PGA Tour before the age of 25. His career earnings total over $12 million, according to the PGA Tour.LIV Golf, preparing for its third event of the 2024 after tournaments in Mexico and Las Vegas, expanded its format to include 54 golfers across 13 teams this season, with the addition of two wildcard picks – unassigned to a team – for each event.The total prize purse for this week’s Jeddah leg sits at $25 million, with $4 million reserved for the individual winner.The Saudi-backed circuit continues to work with the PGA Tour and DP World (European) Tour towards last year’s reconciliation agreement to end their long-running feud, with the initial deadline for a resolution extended from December."

        "text": "Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) head coach Steve Cherundolo said it was an “absolute disgrace” that his team’s match against Real Salt Lake (RSL) went ahead despite a blizzard engulfing the America First Field in Sandy, Utah on Saturday.After the Major League Soccer (MLS) match had been delayed for more than three hours due to the inclement conditions, LAFC sunk to a 3-0 defeat while the snow fell around the players.“It was not difficult conditions [but] impossible conditions, an absolute joke that we had to play today,” Cherundolo told reporters.“Not safe for the players, one of the worst professional sporting events I’ve ever seen in my life. I feel terrible for the players we put them through this. The game could have and should have been called many times beforehand.”Kickoff had originally been scheduled for 2 p.m. ET but was postponed for two hours due to high winds. The match then got underway for four minutes but was postponed again for another hour due to nearby lightning strikes.According to LAFC, the players endured “near freezing temperatures brought on by one of Utah’s strongest winter storms of the year.”Once the match began, RSL produced a dominant first-half display, scoring three goals and putting the game beyond LAFC’s reach.Andrés Gómez scored his team’s first two goals – the first after he shimmied past the last line of defence and poked the ball past a diving Hugo Lloris, and the second after Diego Luna set it up for him to strike into the net.Gómez turned provider for RSL’s third goal just before halftime when his cross into the box found Chico Arango, who slid along the snow-laden grass and guided the ball into the net.“You prepare all week for obviously normal conditions, you prepare teams for certain tactics, and when it gets that crazy and that unplayable, nothing you do in preparation matters … It just baffles me that we would put players through this,” Cherundolo added.“I didn’t even watch the game, the last 20 minutes you couldn’t see anything.”CNN has contacted MLS for comment on Cherundolo’s remarks.Meanwhile, RSL head coach Pablo Mastroeni paid tribute to his players’ “mentality” and “mindset to not allow circumstances beyond their control to affect them.”“You don’t prepare for this type of game by training in it,” he told reporters. “And I think the team that quickly adapts to the circumstances around them and controls the controllables has a better chance in it.“It wasn’t easy for either team, so just a real credit to the players.”"

        "title": "Jon Rahm takes a swing at world ranking rules after LIV Golf abandons ‘fight’ for points",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Former world No. 1 Jon Rahm criticized golf’s world ranking system on Wednesday, a day after LIV Golf formally withdrew its bid for the Spaniard and other players to accumulate points from playing its events.LIV Golf commissioner and CEO Greg Norman announced the decision in a letter sent to the tour’s membership, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. It ends a long-running pursuit by the Saudi-backed circuit to be recognized by the Official Golf World Rankings (OWGR), who unanimously rejected their request to join in October last year.“We have made enormous efforts to fight for you and to ensure your accomplishments are recognized within the existing ranking system,” Norman wrote in Tuesday’s letter.“Unfortunately, the OWGR has shown little willingness to productively work with us.”Following October’s rejection, OWGR chairman Peter Dawson said that “concerns” over LIV Golf’s 54-hole, no cut format meant that it would not be “fair and equitable” to the 24 eligible tours to allow players to accumulate points at its events.Though exact criteria differs between the major championships, all four of the men’s flagship tournaments incorporate world ranking points as a viable qualifier.The Masters, the first major of the season that tees off next month, offers automatic invites to any player who ranked inside the world’s top-50 in the previous calendar year or in the week prior to the tournament.Reigning Masters champion Rahm spent several weeks at world No. 1 after securing his second major title at Augusta National last year.After joining LIV Golf in December – he was then world No. 3 – the 29-year-old is currently the highest-placed of four players from the tour inside the top-50; Tyrell Hatton (17), Brooks Koepka (30) and Cameron Smith (50).Having called the OWGR “laughable” at the 2022 DP World Tour Championship, Rahm doubled down on his criticisms ahead of LIV Golf’s fourth event of the season in Hong Kong this week.“I didn’t think it was a good system back then, and if anything, the more time that goes on, the more it proves to be wrong,” he told reporters Wednesday.CNN has contacted the OWGR offering the organization the opportunity to comment.Rahm highlighted the recent performances of Joaquin Niemann, whose victory at LIV Golf-Jeddah in Saudi Arabia last week meant he has now won two of the tour’s first three events this year.Ranked 76th in the world, the Chilean had been competing on the DP World Tour – formerly the European Tour – to try and gain the ranking points needed to qualify for The Masters, only to see his goal unexpectedly realized courtesy of a special invitation to play the 88th edition of tournament last month.“If anybody in this world, for example, doesn’t think Joaco [Niemann] deserves to be in the top 10 or doesn’t know that he’s a top player in the world, I don’t know what game you’re watching,” said Rahm, who automatically qualifies for The Masters as a previous champion.“I think anybody who watches golf can tell who the best players in the world are, and obviously I don’t think the ranking is reflective of that right now to its entirety.“I’m very happy to see Joaco get invites,” Rahm added. “He’s shown the interest of wanting to qualify many different ways and has played the way you’re supposed to play, so I think it’s only right.”World No.4 Viktor Hovland said an inability for top players to gain points “devalues” the ranking system, as the Norwegian joined several PGA Tour stars in discussing the issue this week.“Rankings are rankings, they’re not objective truth,” the Norwegian told reporters ahead of the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida on Wednesday.“Obviously, now when you have a huge chunk of really, really good players that are not getting any ranking points, it definitely devalues that ranking.“At the end of the day, I don’t show up out here to try to improve my world ranking, I show up because I want to win this tournament and that’s it.”American duo Xander Schauffele and Will Zalatoris both welcomed Niemann’s invitation to The Masters.“I think that’s very well deserved,” Schauffele, world No.5, told reporters Tuesday.“I haven’t read too much of it, to be completely honest, but it seems that they’re not seeing sort of eye to eye on making an exemption to make LIV have World Ranking points. I’m not sure as to why they pulled their application for it, but it is what it is.”World No. 34 Zalatoris added: “You see what Joaquin’s done this year … the guy’s played some really good golf.“That’s kind of the utopian goal for all of us right now is to have the best players in the world play week in, week out. I love this week in general, because we got the best players on the PGA Tour, and we’ve got guys that obviously really care about it, but I also think we’ll see what happens going forward.“I don’t have the fix for it. I know some guys have voiced their opinions on it. I like staying out of that stuff. Right now, it’s in an interesting position, I’ll leave it at that.”"

        "title": "Explosive knockouts, unique fighting style and a love for dancing: meet the UFC’s newest debutant, Michael ‘Venom’ Page",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Michael Page stands motionless looking directly into a camera. Around him the room is an a frenzy, but he calmly spreads his arms wide while still locking eyes with the camera.He is eventually dragged away, but not before sticking his tongue out at the camera operator, letting out a guttural scream of celebration.The reason for the pose? Page has just burst onto the mixed martial arts (MMA) scene, performing an explosive tornado kick to win via technical knockout on his professional debut; the move drew parallels with Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) great Anderson Silva.The moment goes viral on social media and YouTube afterwards, vaulting Page into the consciousness of the wider MMA community despite it being his debut.Twelve years on, the fighter from London will make his UFC debut against Kevin Holland on March 9 at UFC 299.As one of MMA’s more polarizing figures due to his unique fighting style and the panache he brings to his bouts, the 36-year-old Page describes his fights as the “full package deal.”“If you come to see my fights, it’s not just what happens in the fight: it’s before the fight, the build-up, it’s the walk out to a fight and it’s the celebration after the fight, which I’m very much known for,” Page told CNN Sport.“But the fighting style, I’d say that comes from, it’s part of my personality. There’s a few elements. The Caribbean culture. I love to dance, love to smile, just loud, a bit more like outgoing.”Both of his parents practised Lau Gar kung fu before moving to freestyle kickboxing, while he also had aunts and uncles who competed, as did a lot of his siblings. He says his parents were his “main inspirations” for taking up fighting.“Even if I was to take you to my mom’s house now, there’s trophies there that are not mine, they’re hers,” says Page, adding that is family were “raised through the martial arts.”He has fond memories of the bus rides to and from competitions, creating songs and singing them with his family as they traveled to and from events.Page admits that he used to get his “ass kicked a lot” in those early stages of his career, but that the camaraderie, the stories, the friends he met along the way was a tonic to what happened in the ring.While some of his family members gave up competitive fighting as the years went by, Page stuck with it. He learned the ropes and made his first steps in kickboxing as he toughened up.Page then switched to mixed martial arts. Kickboxing’s limited earnings played a part in that decision, but so was his desire to keep learning new skills – something MMA offered.“You have to learn jujitsu, you have to learn wrestling, there’s so much extra things I’d have to learn. Even the style of kickboxing is different,” Page said.He initially was set on moving to Miami to train, but a last-minute visit to London Shootfighters changed his mind.London Shootfighters has earned a reputation for regularly producing top-level combat sports competitors, and Page could tell instantly that it was the place for him.“From being taught very well from a young age, I can hear sense. Even if I went to a football club, I can tell when a coach knows how to coach. When I got there, I could tell that the guys talking really know how to coach,” said Page of London Shootfighters and its reputation of regularly producing top-level competitors.“I fell in love with it. Fell in love with the coaches, their knowledge, how intense they were because I was really game to go and be the best.”With his background in kickboxing, Page’s MMA style of fighting has incorporated elements from other disciplines, all resulting in his unorthodox technique.Unlike many of his rivals, Page will fight with his arms down by his side, prioritizing keeping his distance and launching devasting strikes from afar.He says his unique style is akin to that of the Looney Tunes’ ‘Tasmanian Devil’ or the video game character ‘Crash Bandicoot.’“There’s a lot of crazy stuff that happens. It’s visually entertaining because it’s not the normal. I don’t just walk in a straight line. I have to do things extremely differently.”Page describes himself as a “showman.” He can be seen seemingly taunting his opponents mid-fight, rolling his shoulders similar to a dance move and fighting with a broad smile on his face. Page has watched some of his dad’s old fights and he recognizes that showman streak in his father as well.That “showman” element acknowledges to his upbringing on the road as well as his Caribbean culture.Such is his dedication to his ostentatious persona, Page used to study Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson and how he delivered his lines during his WWE heyday while also writing down lines to save for later, all in order to build his brand.Page’s showmanship feeds into his MMA ‘Venom’ moniker, which is a nod to the force of his punch, despite his slight frame.His flying knee knockout of Evangelista Santos in 2016 only added to his nickname: Michael ‘Venom’ Page – or more simply, ‘MVP.’However, Page’s distinctive style isn’t for all in the fighting community. While some praise its flair, others have critiqued its effectiveness and longevity.Page has also received flak for his lackadaisical nature and flamboyant movements seemingly taunting and goading opponents.His flowing, almost rhythmical movements in the ring can often seem a jarring juxtaposition to his counterparts’ more surgical style.“When I’m expressing myself like that, I am at my most comfortable,” says Page. “Now having somebody throw punches and kicks and try and take off your head and choke you out and say that you’re comfortable in front of them is a difficult thing to achieve. So I have to do as many things as I can to relax myself.“Dancing, I love. Music – it’s almost like I could hear music in my head, but the crowd is my music. So all of those things just keep me nice and calm. And fighting in a high intensity situation, being calm allows you to see so much more than trying to match the energy of what’s going on around you.”The negative comments he’s received over the years – he describes the chatter after his debut fight as 98% negative – for his style have previously bothered him, but now he’s come to appreciate just having people talk about him.“The good thing about that: it means more people are talking about it because there’s a conversation to be had. If everybody’s on the same side, then it’s not much of a conversation,” Page tells CNN.Through his success in the ring, Page rose through Bellator’s welterweight division. And after leaving the championship last year, he signed with the UFC in free agency where he’ll make his welterweight debut against Holland in Miami.Page explains his training has been “extremely painful” for his fight with Holland, although he stresses that he won’t change much from what’s worked before.He will join a division whose titleholder is fellow Briton Leon Edwards.Although it remains a long way off at this point, a potential title fight between two British fighters in the UK is an ambition for Page.“So there’s certain times where I do turn to look out for the outside and everybody else that’s watching. And I don’t think it’s happened before, two UK fighters fighting for a UFC title,” said Page.“Regardless of the win, the belt stays in the UK, which is great for the UK, but also I think both me and him can build such a crowd and such an excitement for that fight that we could do it in a stadium, which I’d love to do.”"

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Kylian Mbappé had a night to remember on Tuesday, scoring two goals and being touted as the world’s best player, as he helped Paris Saint-Germain advance to the quarterfinals of the Champions League.The 25-year-old’s double led the French side to a 2-1 victory over Real Sociedad in San Sebastián, Spain, giving it a 4-1 victory on aggregate over the two legs of their round-of-16 clash.The first goal of the night was a microcosm of Mbappé’s skillset – exploding down the left side of the pitch before bamboozling his defender with some quick feet before lashing it across goal into the bottom corner in the 15th minute.Such was the power of his goal that the strike actually broke the net, leaving a hole behind between post and net. The game had to be stopped while repairs took place.Mbappé doubled PSG’s lead on the night and effectively finished off the tie 11 minutes after halftime with another trademark goal.The French superstar sprung free down the left with a ball over the top before wrong-footing Alejandro Remiro in goal.Although Mikel Merino scored late on to give Real Sociedad some consolation, the evening was all about Mbappé and his excellent outing.After PSG had confirmed its ticket to the last eight of the Champions League, Mbappé expressed his relief at advancing to the next stage.“We’re really happy. That was the objective, we wanted to qualify, but we also wanted to win. We had a gameplan that was clear, and we managed to score early. We didn’t come under too much pressure, just a little at the end,” he said after the match.“[Scoring goals] is what I do. It’s what I like to do, what I can do. My job is to help the team score goals, to help offensively, defensively, and today, I did a nice job.”Mbappé himself was the subject of praise after his match-winning performance, with his manager Luis Enrique lauding him as the “No. 1 player in the world.”“He’ll score 50 goals and get 25 assists with whatever coach in whichever team. Unfortunately, in the immediate future, he won’t be here, and we have to start trying out other teammates,” Enrique told France’s Canal+.Mbappé – who is reportedly leaving the club to join Real Madrid at the end of the season, according to multiple reports citing unnamed sources in February – now sits atop the scoring charts in the Champions League with six goals, tied with Harry Kane who also scored two goals on Tuesday night as Bayern Munich advanced to the quarterfinals.Erling Haaland sits a goal behind on five, and when the choice of the three of them to build a team around was put to former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand, his answer was emphatic.“Mbappé, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. They’re all great. There’s no bad or wrong answer here really, but … Mbappé, man,” he said on TNT Sports.“I’d pay every day to watch him train let alone play in a match because he creates things on his own. I can give him the ball at left-back and he might score. I can give him the ball anywhere on the pitch and he could create something. The other two not so much. They are great, don’t get me wrong.“But Mbappé’s just got that something different that would make me sit up at night and go: ‘Thank you, God.’”Ferdinand’s former teammate Owen Hargreaves agreed and touted Mbappé alongside the greats of the game, naming legendary forwards such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldo Nazario as comparisons.Hargreaves also predicted that Mbappé, who has already won the World Cup with France and is PSG’s all-time leading goalscorer, will win a Ballon d’Or in his career."

        "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.“There’s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you’ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,” the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation – a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is “the only sport that can save your life.”The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.“I used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,” she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.“There’s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,” Dale adds.She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London.It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people – and leaving many more without homes.“There’s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons … who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,” Dale says.“Many people say it’s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they’ve taken time for themselves.”While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England’s report, published in January 2020.Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found.This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have “low” or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country’s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a “Whites Only” rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England – England’s national swimming governing body – and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.“Most drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,” says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family – a 53-year-old father and his two children – died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.“This was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,” Obe says. “(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, ‘We’ve been talking about doing something for our community. We’ve got to do something. We’ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.’”“It’s no longer just about that lack of representation,” Obe adds.“It’s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.”However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.“At the moment, we don’t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn’t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.”Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, “implores” people to learn to swim.“I have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who’s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,” she tells CNN Sport.“I take the two of them just as they are – kind of like separate things. I’m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.”At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people – especially Black girls – who wanted to break into the sport.But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.“Fortunately, for myself, I haven’t come across any barriers at the level I’m at currently,” Dearing says.“But I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don’t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we’re better suited to other sports and so shouldn’t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.”CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.FINA – the global governing body for swimming – told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its “Swimming for All, Swimming for Life” program.“FINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,” the organization said to CNN in a statement. “FINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally.“Work will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,” FINA added.Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is “committed to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.”“Barriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups – like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,” the statement added.Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than £550 million ($670 million), which they’ve selected “due to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.”“It’s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,” Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.“Our goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they’re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,” he added.Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.From representing their organization at the UK’s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney – one of the most deprived boroughs in London – Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.“That community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,” says Obe.“Only in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.”In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.Speaking about the program, Obe says: “It’s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we’re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don’t engage in aquatics, why we don’t see the representation pool side and why we don’t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.”Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she’s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.“I really think if anything is going to change, it’s going to be now, it’s going to be over the next couple of years,” she says. “Each story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there’s nothing wrong with that, that’s just another challenge that we have to face and we’re up for it.“It’s tough – it’s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.“I like to feel that I’m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.“It’s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it’s really frightening and daunting, but if I’m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.”"

        "title": "How will the new UEFA Champions League format work?",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "The UEFA Champions League – the most prestigious competition in European club football – is getting a makeover, promising a completely different look and feel when it kicks off next season.According to UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin, the new format was passed unanimously by the organization’s executive committee and will see qualification “based on sporting merit.”From next season, UEFA hopes, fans will get to see more top-level matches earlier in the competition with higher stakes in each game.So how will the Champions League work from the 2024/25 season?The primary change is that 32 teams will no longer compete in eight groups of four during the group stages. Instead, the opening round will be an expanded 36-team stage in which the teams participate in a single league.Each team will play eight matches against eight different clubs, four at home and four away. The teams each club plays will be selected from four seeded pots (based on ranking) with two opponents being drawn from each – with one home game and one away game per pot.This is a departure from the current group-stage format, in which teams play against the three other teams in their group twice (one home and one away game per opponent).UEFA says that it wants clubs to test themselves against a wider range of opposition and believes that the top teams will “go head to head more often and earlier in the competition” in the new format.The top eight teams in the league will qualify automatically for the knockout round, and the teams ranked ninth to 24th will have to compete in a two-legged play-off to determine who also reaches the last 16.Unlike the current format, there will be no opportunity for teams to qualify for the Europa League as those finishing 25th or lower, as well as those who lose their play-off tie, will be eliminated.The victorious teams in the play-off round will then face the top eight seeded teams in the first knockout round (last-16 stage) before the quarterfinals, semifinals and a showpiece – one-off – final. The 2025 final will be staged at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany.As in the current format, teams will qualify based on their domestic performance in the previous season.Two of the four new teams will qualify from the top two countries in the UEFA co-efficient rankings, which are calculated based on the results of all clubs in UEFA’s three competitions.Currently, those clubs will come from Italy and Germany, the top two countries in the co-efficient rankings.One team will qualify for finishing third in the fifth-ranked association in UEFA’s access list – currently France – while another spot will be awarded to a domestic champion “by extending from four to five the number of clubs qualifying via the Champions path of the competition’s qualifying process,” according to UEFA.The Europa League, Europe’s second-tier club competition, will follow the same, revamped format as the Champions League next season.The Europa Conference League will be rebranded as the UEFA Conference League and will see teams play six matches against six different opponents in the league phase.Both competitions will also have 36 teams.The league phase of the Champions League and Europa League will take place between September and January, while the Conference League’s first stage will be held between September and December.Games will still be midweek (Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday) and each of the three leagues will have their own exclusive match week."

        "title": "‘Breaking has total freedom for me,’ says Menno van Gorp, a medal hopeful in the newest Olympic sport",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "To the tune of a Miles Davis trumpet solo, Menno van Gorp is stepping up his training ahead of this year’s Paris Olympics.The jazz musician has been an influential figure in van Gorp’s breakdance career, his smooth sound and freewheeling rhythms a constant source of inspiration for each new routine.“I love to practice on jazz,” van Gorp tells CNN Sport. “It gives me more freedom and it just triggers more creativity when I move to jazz. Also, the part of improvisation in jazz is huge. I think that really reflects well with breaking.”The 35-year-old van Gorp, a competitive b-boy from the Netherlands known simply as Menno, is a medal hopeful at the upcoming Olympics, where breakdance – or breaking – will make its debut as the Games’ newest sport.Suddenly seeing their discipline labeled as a sport isn’t something that necessarily sits comfortably with b-boys and b-girls – the name given to men and women who compete in breaking.It has some similarities with pre-existing Olympic events like martial arts, gymnastics, and skateboarding, but will also bring its own subversive identity to this year’s Games.“We’re under the flag of sports now, but to me, it’s still also an art,” says van Gorp, who calls himself an “artlete” on social media. “I think breaking is so unique that it’s impossible to put it in one box … It’s many things together, and it’s also an expression.”A high-scoring breakdance routine requires a unique blend of strength, stamina, agility, and flexibility, as well as the mental wherewithal to ensure that moves aren’t repeated and flow seamlessly into each other.“You use literally every part of your body,” says van Gorp, “including your ears and your brains and your heart and your toes and your heels … I use my fingertips; I use the point of my elbow – every part in your body that you can use.“It takes a lot of physical abilities, I think, to be a good breaker.”Van Gorp practiced judo before he took up breaking, which found a foothold in his hometown of Tilburg during the 1990s.“First everybody was collecting Pokémon cards, then everybody was yo-yoing,” he says. “Suddenly, everybody started breaking.”After eight years of judo, he had started to find the sport too restrictive, the scope for creativity too narrow.“Breaking gave me so much freedom compared to judo,” van Gorp adds. “Breaking has total freedom for me, so that’s why I really liked it. In other sports, you’re always limited by a lot of rules.”Originating in New York in the late 1960s, breaking has since gained global popularity and today is synonymous with a specific subgenre of street style – sneakers, sweatpants, and baseball caps worn at an angle.Van Gorp, like many kids discovering breakdance for the first time in the early 2000s, gained insight from watching grainy videos and talking through routines with his friends before joining practices around the Netherlands and overseas.It was in winning the UK championships in 2007 that van Gorp says he “exploded onto the scene” and started to compete more regularly.He has gone on to win titles all over the world, including at the 2019 WDSF World Breaking Championship and three victories at the Red Bull BC One World Finals – a feat only matched by South Korean b-boy Hong 10.Breaking is the first World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) event to be added to the Olympic program, and in Paris, 16 b-boys and 16 b-girls will face off in one-on-one battles set against a DJ’s hip-hop soundtrack.They take it in turns to perform a routine and are scored by a panel of judges based on six criteria: creativity, personality, technique, performativity, variety, and musicality.With the Olympics in mind, van Gorp is breaking for up to two and a half hours each day, plus gym sessions and calisthenics – body-weight strength training like push-ups and sit-ups – in pursuit of winning gold.Such an accolade, he says, would be a huge boost for his profile.“I’m building here a dance studio in Rotterdam and I’m working also on the new generation here,” van Gorp explains. “Getting a medal I think would be so helpful for my career after breaking to make stuff happen for the next generation – that type of stamp on your name.”On top of establishing his dance school, van Gorp is also an amateur photographer; he paints – typically large canvasses streaked in brightly-colored lines – has his own clothes brand and is a father of two.His life, therefore, is a juggling act while training for the Olympics, which is all-consuming at the moment. In order to qualify for the Games, van Gorp will hope to earn selection via the Olympic Qualifier Series in May and June.Like every breaking competition, that will test not only his movement and creativity in the heat of a battle but also his memory: originality is rewarded, and contestants are scored down for repeating moves between rounds.“It all comes down to preparation,” says van Gorp. “I study my material a lot. I’ve found memory hacks to remember my stuff, so I give names to my moves. I make rhymes, I connect them with moments in life. I connect them with music I like.“And I write stuff down, I try it, I read it back, I visualize, and you pick between competitions what material you have left. And then in the battle it should all just fall in place.”Van Gorp compares himself to a “cage fighter” in the middle of a battle – “I really need to have that fire … it’s not about being a nice guy anymore,” he says – and believes that he thrives on being spontaneous and unpredictable during competitions.“A lot of unexpected movements, a lot of creativity,” he identifies as features of his routines. “My style is definitely based on flow and transitions, and I think you need to have a very well-trained eye to understand what I’m really doing.“If you blink one time or if you look away, you might have missed an important detail.”Having a unique style can be key in breaking, as it is with any form of art or music. It’s something that has drawn van Gorp to Miles Davis in particular.“To see how many times he reinvented himself and he still stayed authentic to himself, that’s a huge inspiration for me,” he says.Few other, if any, athletes will be honing their craft to the emotive sounds of jazz music ahead of this year’s Olympics, but that’s part of what makes breaking such an intriguing addition.“If you want to make art,” says van Gorp, “you want to make something that’s really you – not somebody else.”"

        "text": "Sam Kerr, Chelsea FC star and Australia women’s captain, pleaded not guilty to a “racially aggravated offense” of a police officer, British authorities said Monday.The 30-year-old striker was charged following an incident involving an officer on January 30 last year in Twickenham, a suburb of southwest London.The officer was “responding to a complaint involving a taxi fare,” a Metropolitan Police spokesperson wrote in a statement to CNN Monday.Kerr was charged “via postal charge requisition on 21 January with a racially aggravated offense under Section 4A Public Order Act 1986,” the Met Police added.Kerr denied the charge at the Kingston Upon Thames Crown Court on Monday, the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed to CNN.She is scheduled to appear at Wimbledon Magistrates Court on 1 February 2025, the Met Police said.Football Australia said it was “aware of the legal proceedings involving Sam Kerr in the United Kingdom” and would provide “support” to the Matilda’s captain.“As this is an ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide further comment at this time. Our focus remains on supporting all our players, both on and off the field. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide support as appropriate,” Football Australia said.CNN has reached out to Chelsea FC, who declined to comment.The Perth-born soccer star signed for Chelsea in 2019 and helped transformed the club into the best women’s team in the country, winning four straight Women’s Super League (WSL) titles, three FA Cups and two League Cups in her four seasons in London.Since joining, Kerr has gone on to score 99 goals in 128 matches.Last year, she led the Australia women’s team in making national history by becoming the first team – men’s or women’s – to reach a soccer World Cup semifinal.In January, Kerr suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during training, according to Chelsea FC and the Matildas, ruling her out of the second half of the English Women’s Super League season and Australia’s AFC Women’s Olympic Qualifiers Round 3 series against Uzbekistan in February."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "American Coco Gauff said that she was “fueled” by a heated exchange with the umpire during her 2-6 6-4 6-3 victory against Karolína Plíšková at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Wednesday.The incident, which has been viewed over five million times on one social media account, came midway through the match when Gauff, having lost the first set, was serving with a 4-2 lead in the second.Her first serve at deuce was initially called out by chair umpire Pierre Bacchi, but the world No. 3 had expected to be awarded the point after a successful challenge.However, Bacchi said that the point should be replayed, while Gauff argued that the umpire’s call had come after Plíšková had hit a return into the net.A tense debate lasting close to five minutes ensued, during which Gauff vehemently argued that she deserved the point because of the late call and wanted to see the tournament supervisor.“You’re going to apologize after this match because you know you messed up,” she said. “I’ve never questioned anything like this before.”Footage of the moment appears to show that Gauff had a point: Bacchi’s call of out did come after Plíšková had hit the ball.“This is an absurd exchange for this umpire,” former US tennis player Andy Roddick wrote on X, formerly Twitter, adding that Bacci was “completely wrong.”CNN has contacted the WTA Tour and the International Tennis Federation for comment regarding the incident.In the end, Gauff replayed the point, then went on to win the game and the set. In the decider, she broke Pliskova at 4-3 and held off two break points the following game to claim the victory in one hour and 53 minutes.“I think it just fueled me,” US Open champion Gauff said about the argument with the umpire in the second set, according to Reuters.“It’s just one point. It happens in tennis. Players make mistakes, everybody makes mistakes. I was trying to tell myself to stay calm the next point. Sometimes I get angry and I go for too much. I was trying to let that not be the turning point for the set.“Maybe I dragged it out a little longer than I needed to, but I did what I felt was best in that moment.”The victory means that the 19-year-old will now face Russian world No. 40 Anna Kalinskaya in the quarterfinals in Dubai.It will be Gauff’s third quarterfinal of 2024 having started the year with a victory in Auckland before reaching the semifinals of the Australian Open.Earlier this month, she had a surprise defeat against Kateřina Siniaková in the second round of the Qatar Open in Doha.Gauff was named on Time’s Woman of the Year list on Wednesday after winning her first grand slam title at the US Open in September."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "An Iditarod competitor has been handed a two-hour penalty after failing to properly gut a moose he killed in “self-defense” during Alaska’s legendary long-distance sled dog race, organizers said Wednesday.Veteran musher Dallas Seavey had told race officials early Monday morning that he had been forced to dispatch a moose after it had become entangled with his dogs. One dog was subsequently injured in the incident and was flown to Anchorage for veterinary care.Rule 34 states that if an “edible big game animal (i.e., moose, caribou, buffalo) is killed in defense of life or property,” the musher must gut the animal properly and report the incident to a race official.Officials defined gutting an animal “as taking out the intestines and other internal organs of (a fish or other animal) before cooking it.”Seavey, who has won the race five times, did notify race officials, but a three-person panel judged the musher had not sufficiently gutted the animal after he spent approximately 10 minutes at the site of the incident.“It fell on my sled, it was sprawled on the trail,” Seavey told an Iditarod television crew. “I gutted it the best I could, but it was ugly.”Officials confirmed the two-hour penalty will be assessed at Seavey’s next 24-hour layover. They also said that the moose was later “retrieved, processed and salvaged” and was being “distributed.”Seavey’s Instagram account said his dog – Faloo – had been given “excellent care” by the Iditarod vets and been allowed to go home.“We hope to gain additional perspective and insight as Dallas learns that his 24 hour rest is now a 26 hour rest,” said Seavey’s Instragram post. “Thus far the race does seem to have its fair share of set backs, but we know that Dallas will be evaluating and strategizing for the next portion of the race in spite of the difficulties.”CNN has reached out to race organizers to offer Seavey the opportunity to comment.The race traditionally begins on the first Saturday in March, starting in Anchorage and ending in Nome.The race ranges from 975 to 998 miles long, depending on whether the southern or northern route is being run. The length can also vary from year to year based on course conditions.The beginning of the race in Anchorage is considered a ceremonial start. The competitive part of the race usually begins the next day in Willow.The event is named after the Iditarod Trail, an old mail and supply route, traveled by dogsleds from Seward and Knik to Nome. A short first edition of the race was held in 1967 with the current full running to Nome debuting in 1973.The Iditarod has faced criticism from animal rights charities.Last year, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said: “In just the last decade, dogs competing in the event have died from various causes, including asphyxiation, heart attacks, trauma from being struck by a vehicle, freezing to death, excess fluid in the lungs, and acute aspiration pneumonia—caused by inhaling vomit.”In a statement to CNN on Thursday, PETA called for Seavey to be removed from the race after he failed to travel back to the nearest checkpoint to get the most “immediate care” for his injured dog. Instead, Seavey traveled onto the next checkpoint on the trail before the dog received treatment.“Mushers’ prioritization of victory over dogs’ wellbeing is everything that’s wrong with the Iditarod,” PETA said in a statement."

        "title": "Anthony Joshua vs. Francis Ngannou: former world champion faces MMA star with future title fight potentially on the line",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "The worlds of boxing and mixed martial arts have become entwined in recent years, with the stars of both sports meeting in the boxing ring to display their various talents.Francis Ngannou is arguably the fighter who has taken the swap of disciplines most seriously, clashing with world heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury last year in his boxing debut and more than holding his own in a controversial defeat.And the former UFC heavyweight title holder will once again step into the ring to take on another British former world heavyweight champion, this time in the shape of Anthony Joshua.With a possible future title fight on the line – reports have suggested the winner could face the victor of the highly-anticipated Fury-Oleksandr Usyk unification fight – there’s a lot riding on Joshua and Ngannou’s clash.Here’s everything you need to know.Ngannou and Joshua will exchange blows on Friday, March 8 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the location of Ngannou’s previous fight against Fury.They will take part in a 10-round clash, with their ring walks expected at around 6 p.m.E.T. / 11 p.m. UK time.Fans in the US and around the world can watch the event on DAZN pay-per-view, while Sky Sports will show the event in the UK.Ngannou’s switch to boxing perhaps shouldn’t have come as a surprise given he began his fighting career in the ring.Even before that, Ngannou underwent a remarkable journey – leaving Cameroon with just a backpack and traveling north through Africa to reach Europe – just to train as a fighter.Ngannou battled crossing the Mediterranean by sea and was even detained in Spain for two months in a migrant center for illegally entering the country, according to the Guardian, before eventually reaching Paris where he found a gym to train. He remembers what he asked the owner at that time.“I have no money, I have nothing, but I want to be a world champion.”However, the French-Cameroonian later moved to the octagon and went on to have huge success with the UFC.He won the UFC heavyweight title in 2021, taking off of Stipe Miocic and later defended it against Frenchman Ciryl Gane.Although Ngannou later left the UFC over a contract dispute and moved to the Professional Fighters League, he has yet to compete in the PFL and instead focused on his boxing career.His debut fight against Fury came with a lot of fanfare, and Ngannou lived up to it as he traded blows with one of the greats of the sport, knocking down the British fighter in the third round of their clash. Despite losing on points, many scored the fight in Ngannou’s favor.Ngannou has said that he thought that he won the fight with Fury and called himself the “underground king” of boxing.Joshua himself was also impressed by Ngannou’s display. “I was watching the Fury and Ngannou fight from home, and from what I saw, I thought he won,” Joshua told Sky Sports.“It’s not a gimmick, it’s not something that’s benefiting the broadcasters, it’s not just a fight for entertainment purposes,” added Joshua.“This is a serious fight with someone who is prepared and understands the dynamic of boxing and he’s putting up a good fight against the apparently generational great. So I look at it now as something completely different.”And ahead of his second professional boxing fight, Ngannou is confident of victory against Joshua, also questioning his opponent’s ability to withstand his power.“I heard that he doesn’t have a chin,” Ngannou said, per Reuters.“I don’t know if it’s true or not. We’re going to find out. I hope I have the opportunity to test that out, that’s my wish.”For Joshua, the fight is the next stage on his road to redemption.Having burst onto the boxing scene with a 22-fight unbeaten streak, a defeat to Andy Ruiz Jr. and two to Usyk have dented his reputation as a serious title contender.The 34-year-old has achieved a three-fight win streak to put himself back in contention, but he still hasn’t yet returned to his previously untouchable status.While some suggested Fury didn’t take Ngannou seriously enough before their fight, Joshuya is making no such assumptions.“I don’t put that pressure on myself and I don’t have that thought about anything.I just think about winning and doing what I need to do, that’s my mentality,” Joshua said.“It’s a fight, it’s a 50/50 fight. Anything can happen. Crazier things have happened before. It is what it is. It’s a great opportunity for me to go back to work. If I didn’t take this opportunity that’s presented to me, when would I be fighting next?“When you look at it, I’m not at the start of my career, I’m not at the middle of my career, I’d say I’m probably towards the end of my career.“Call it whatever you want to call it, I’m just happy to be at work and doing my job and I can’t wait for the next opportunity that presents itself.”A clash between the two British heavyweight boxing stars – Joshua and Fury – has been tipped for years now, but has never taken place.If Joshua was to win against Ngannou, promoter Eddie Hearn isn’t ruling out the long-clamored bout finally taking place.“The dream for Joshua has always been to be undisputed,” Hearn told the BBC. “If AJ beats Ngannou and Fury beats Usyk, the whole world will be calling for Fury vs. Joshua.“It’s probably one of the biggest fights in the history of the sport. Certainly the biggest fight in boxing now.”"

        "title": "Oakland A’s vision of Las Vegas ballpark draws comparisons with Sydney Opera House – and an armadillo",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "The Oakland Athletics have released renderings of their new, 33,000-seat ballpark on the Las Vegas Strip, which is set to be canopied by an enormous, five-tier roof.Inspired by baseball pennants, some have compared the ballpark’s design to the Sydney Opera House, while others likened the individual tiers to the scales of an armadillo.Designed by Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) and HNTB, the venue will sit on nine acres of the 35-acre Tropicana casino site and overlook the Las Vegas skyline, offering “an unmatched fan experience,” according to A’s owner John Fisher.The A’s are due to start playing games at the new ballpark in 2028 after Major League Baseball owners approved the franchise’s relocation from the Bay Area to Nevada in November.The outfield will have the world’s biggest cable-net glass window, a Tuesday press release said, and will contain an 18,000-square-foot jumbotron – the largest screen in the MLB.Around the venue will be up to 2,500 parking spots and a large plaza of between two and three acres, but it’s the arresting roof which has really grabbed the attention of fans.Fisher isn’t necessarily averse to comparisons with the Sydney Opera House and the scaly mammal: “I think the armadillo is an underrated animal, and I think the A’s are underrated at times,” he told the San Francisco Chronicle.“But comparisons to the Sydney Opera House is a huge compliment because that’s a building that’s withstood the test of time.”The roof’s overlapping layers are intended to provide shade from the intense Las Vegas sun while also allowing natural light into the ballpark.“The resultant architecture is like a spherical armadillo – shaped by the local climate – while opening and inviting the life of the Strip to enter and explore,” said BIG founder and creative director Bjarke Ingels.“In the city of spectacle, the A’s ‘armadillo’ is designed for passive shading and natural light - the architectural response to the Nevada climate generating a new kind of vernacular icon in Vegas.”BIG, the lead designer in the project, also put forward a design for the A’s new ballpark in Oakland which was never built.The controversial relocation from Oakland – heavily criticized by many fans – will see the A’s become the fourth sporting franchise in Las Vegas, joining the NHL’s Golden Knights, the WNBA’s Aces, and the NFL’s Raiders."

        "title": "A doping free-for-all Enhanced Games calls itself the answer to doping in sports. Opponents say it poses a danger to health",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world’s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what “faster, higher, stronger” – the former motto of the Games – might represent.The Enhanced Games says it is an “alternative” to what it calls the “corrupt Olympics Games.”Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won’t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete.That’s quite a contrast to the Olympics’ doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024’s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals.When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that “the idea does not merit any comment.”CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition.Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia’s state-sponsored doping program – a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 – said that the Enhanced Games is a “danger to health, to sport.”Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations.The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D’Souza. He is also the founding editor of “The Journal Jurisprudence,” a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an “avid athlete.”Recently, D’Souza told CNN Sport he has “signed term sheets with prominent venture capital firms” in relation to the Enhanced Games and is “waiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.” He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December.Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement.D’Souza believes what he calls a “science-driven” competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field.According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope.However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%.Faiss and his team compared athletes’ blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they’re actually doping.This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a “robust way” of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping.In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: “Determining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,” explaining that, since 2017, a “prevalence working group” has been established to “determine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.”WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered “several recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.”WADA has reservations about Faiss’ study and pointed to the “complexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,” highlighting that reports have “greatly varying results.”The anti-doping organization added: “No single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.”“Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence.“In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others.“The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.”Editor’s note: You can find WADA’s full statement at the bottom of this article.Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is “farcical … likely illegal in many [US] states” and “a dangerous clown show, not real sport.”Substances such as anabolic steroids – which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts – are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration.When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “we will not be drug testing at the games.”He added: “We do not propose to regulate what athletes use.”Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine.But that isn’t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov.“If you look at the Enhanced Games website, it’s almost as though they’re advertising their disregard of the law,” Walden told CNN Sport.“They wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete.“I hope they’re thinking hard about how they’re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that’s focusing on these very issues.”The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to “protect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,” according to the government website.The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, “degrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.”“The use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,” Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN.“Promotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit.“It might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.”Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games’ organizers “might get investigated […] under the Rodchenkov Act.”The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events.However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don’t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn’t do.Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 – “Prohibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person” – of the World Anti-Doping Code.USADA’s Tygart also told CNN Sport: “No one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.”D’Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn’t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he’d continue to be a “quiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.”“I do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one’s interested in histories in the past anymore,” said D’Souza.“They’re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.”According to Pierre de Coubertin – the founder of the modern Olympics – “for every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.”Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called “the dirtiest Olympics in history.”When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing.Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event’s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history.Six of the eight finalists – notably the winner, Ben Johnson – who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers.Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers.Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep “elite podiums and finals clean,” according to the anti-doping organization.Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year’s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals.Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests.Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues.“It’s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,” said Faiss.Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is “getting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.”By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night.“Athletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,” he said, adding that “EPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.”Athletes “use the drugs that are actively working.”When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat – the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance – Faiss said athletes “are likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.”Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health.Athletes are “seeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won’t be caught,” said Faiss.Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will “give a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we’re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.”Verroken also questions what’s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards.Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is “setting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.”Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it “dangerous and irresponsible,” saying that “the world needs better than this.”UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it “is extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,” adding that “there is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.”UKAD’s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a “hugely dangerous precedent,” expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes.When CNN Sport spoke to D’Souza shortly after the proposed event’s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media.The organization’s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that “very accomplished athletes” at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out “to understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.”Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers “already have an Olympic medallist” for their athlete commission, though he didn’t specify who that was.He also said there has been “a lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.” Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage.For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories – track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts.The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget.Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events.The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion – almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC’s philosophy of “lower-impact Games” in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics.D’Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to “deliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games” so profits can be shared with the athletes.He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt’s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds.“I’ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said […] if there’s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I’ll be there,” said D’Souza.Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an “enhanced athletes programme.”When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “our athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.”He said: “We will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.”“This will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.”D’Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order to compete.As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D’Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships.“We’re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,” added D’Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would “never” coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach.“Having been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won’t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],” Painter told CNN Sport.If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D’Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity.But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even “undermine the very purpose of the sport in question.”Devine told CNN Sport that “performance-enhancing drugs don’t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.”He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: “To what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes’ sporting excellence?”WADA response in full:Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a Working Group on Doping Prevalence in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs.WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group’s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation.This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results.The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be.Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Jason Kelce’s recent retirement announcement led to an outpouring of emotion from all corners of the NFL, most of all from the former Philadelphia Eagles center himself.Kelce called time on his likely Hall of Fame career in a tearful press conference on Monday after 13 seasons in the league, all of them with Philadelphia.Longtime Eagles trainer Joe O’Pella was able to play a part in the retirement announcement, just like the two of them had done during Kelce’s long run in Philly.In a heartfelt Instagram post on Tuesday, O’Pella revealed that he missed the Eagles’ final game of the season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers – Kelce’s final NFL outing – because of his recent cancer diagnosis and therefore didn’t have the opportunity to tape the center’s ankles and thumbs for one last timeThat was a job that O’Pella had done for the past 13 years.So, in a poignant move, Kelce allowed O’Pella to tape his ankles and thumbs one last time for Monday’s retirement announcement.“You all know about the on-field accomplishments, and many of the off-the-field ones too, but what this man has meant to me and now my family over the past decade plus is nearly indescribable,” O’Pella wrote.“From being his Wing Bowl ‘cornerman,’ to hour long rehab sessions followed by nights out on the town, to sleeping on each other’s couches to being at each other’s weddings, to Sea Isle City Polar Bear Plunges to Super Bowl appearances and a ring, we were there doing it together.“And in what would be his final season, when I was diagnosed with cancer and had to undergo radiation and chemo, he offered his shore house if I needed to get away, and offered to pay for meal services to help my wife and I out, and he called me randomly when I had been home, too sick to come in (because) of chemo, just to check on me and chat about random things. That’s who he is as a person.”“I taped this guy’s ankles and thumbs everyday for 13 seasons, and when he played his last game in Tampa, again I couldn’t be there due to cancer. And when he told me he would be retiring and I expressed my regret of not being the last person to ever tape him, and he offered to have me tape him for his retirement press conference.”In his post, O’Pella details how he specifically asked the Eagles head trainer in Kelce’s second year if he could look after the center’s physical rehabilitation after he had torn his knee ligaments.“What would occur over the next 12+ years would certainly impact my life in a way I never imagine,” O’Pella wrote.Alongside O’Pella’s post in which he detailed his relationship with Kelce, he included a series of photos of the two of them during their time in Philadelphia.Included among those are pictures of the two showing off their Super Bowl rings and selfies they had taken together.“Congratulations to the entire Kelce family on a Hall of Fame career on and off the field,” he signed off the post by saying.“To Kylie’s husband; Wyatt, Elliotte, and Bennett’s dad; the Eagles’ center; Philadelphia’s icon, and my brother: Jason, congratulations on retirement and here’s to the future. I love ya.”"

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Wet conditions were the main talking point during the US women’s soccer team’s penalty shootout victory over Canada in the W Gold Cup semifinals on Wednesday.The game was played on a heavily waterlogged pitch at Snapdragon Stadium in San Diego after torrential rain fell in the build up, with huge sections of standing water affecting the path of the ball and players’ ability to run at pace with it at their feet.Following the snowy conditions Real Salt Lake and LAFC played in over the weekend, the wet field in San Diego was once again a point of controversy.The tricky conditions were highlighted in the 11th minute when US forward Trinity Rodman raced through on goal with only the keeper to beat, only for the ball to stop in the water and halt any goalscoring opportunity.Just minutes later, the US was a beneficiary of the conditions, when Canada defender Vanessa Gilles’ pass to goalkeeper Kaelin Sheridan stopped dramatically in the puddles, allowing Jaedyn Shaw to give the US the lead.Throughout the encounter, players consistently struggled to come to terms with the conditions, with the ball holding up in the water and making it almost impossible to sustain any sense of flow to the game.Former US midfielder Julie Foudy heavily criticized the decision for the game to go ahead on social media, calling it “insane.”“Why isn’t CONCACAF calling this match. Play it (tomorrow). Someone is going to get hurt,” the two-time World Cup winner said on X – formerly known as Twitter – also using the hashtag ‘waterparkgame.’After the game, Canada coach Bev Priestman echoed Foudy’s thoughts.“It’s obvious that the game was unplayable,” Priestman said, per ESPN. “We put in a lot of work in a game plan, and within minute one, it’s thrown out the window.”Priestman added: “I’m not going to make excuses as to was it fair, was it unfair. We played the game in front of us, both teams had to play on the conditions and it was who could adapt the most.”In a statement to CNN, a Concacaf spokesperson said that it is “solely at the discretion of the referee as to whether the field is safe and playable.”There was no shortage of action though in the game, with the teams level 2-2 after extra-time before the US won 3-1 on penalties.Shaw opened the scoring, taking advantage of the watery conditions to slot home, becoming the first US women’s player ever to score in each of her first four starts. Jordyn Huitema leveled for Canada eight minutes from full-time to send the match to extra-time.Sophia Smith gave the US its second lead of the game in extra-time, only for Adriana Leon to level once again, this time from the penalty spot, three minutes from the end to send the game to a shootout.US goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher proved to be the difference maker, saving three Canadian penalties and scoring her own to send her side into the final of the W Gold Cup where it will face Brazil, after the Seleção had beaten Mexico 3-0 in its semifinal.The final will take place in Snapdragon Stadium on Sunday at 8:15 p.m. ET."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "It certainly wasn’t pretty, but Real Madrid booked its place in the Champions League quarterfinals with a 1-1 draw at home to RB Leipzig, scraping through 2-1 on aggregate.But so disappointed were the team with such an underwhelming performance, defender Antonio Rüdiger said there would be no celebrations for reaching the last eight.“They played well and we played bad. Simple,” he told CBS Sports. “I don’t think we were thinking about the first game, we were just sloppy. We were slow, zero intensity, we didn’t get in the challenges and, in the Champions League, you can get punished for this.“At the end of the day, you always have to try and keep your calm … you don’t need to lose your head. They did well, they pressed us behind, they made us stay behind and we didn’t find the right answer today.“The lesson is that you cannot start and finish a match like that in the Champions League. You have to be switched on for 90 minutes – and plus. We don’t celebrate [reaching the quarterfinals] because it was not a good performance, but we are through.”After losing 1-0 at home in a tight first leg, RB Leipzig was a team on a mission at the Santiago Bernabéu on Wednesday and thoroughly outplayed Los Blancos for much of the 90 minutes.Chance after chance came and went for the German side, but it was unable to break the deadlock and level the aggregate scoreline.The team was eventually made to pay for its profligacy in front of goal as Real Madrid caught Leipzig on the counterattack after 65 minutes, with Jude Bellingham bursting forward and setting up Vinícius Jr. for an emphatic finish.However, Leipzig finally got the goal its efforts deserved just three minutes later as Willi Orbán stooped to head home David Raum’s low cross.As the clock ticked into the final few minutes, it was Los Merengues that were forced to hang on for the draw, fending off wave after wave of Leipzig attacks.Dani Olmo came within inches of a goal that would have taken the tie to extra time in stoppage time, but his clever lob hit the top of the crossbar with goalkeeper Andriy Lunin watching on helplessly.After the game, Rüdiger admitted the team “suffered a lot” throughout the match.Bellingham echoed his teammate’s comments, admitting it was “not the best performance” but was proud of the team for being able to win ugly.“Not at our best tonight,” he told TNT Sports. “As a team, individually, for myself as well, but it’s one of those games where you can’t always win playing beautiful football; sometimes, you have to grind them out, defend well at times, make important blocks and then go up the other end and use the chances that you have.“We did that tonight with Vini, so pleased to be through but not satisfied. You look at the game and they’ve drawn 1-1, but it’s not like we’ve played a really poor team. We’ve played a brilliant Leipzig team that came to play, that put it on us from the first minute, so this idea we didn’t have a great game is true, but they’re also a very good team.”The draw for the Champions League quarterfinals, semifinals and final takes place on March 15."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Onlookers have likened a new bulging cycling helmet to something out of Star Wars, while others just think it’s plain ugly. But a leading cycling team hopes that its futuristic-looking design will lead to a “big improvement” in time trial performance.That is as long as the design passes a review by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), cycling’s global governing body.Team Visma-Lease a Bike riders debuted the large helmet at the Tirreno-Adriatico prologue in Italy on Monday. Manufactured by Giro, the Aerohead II helmet has a sizeable front end and is almost as wide as a rider’s shoulders.Although the outlandish design has prompted comparisons to stormtroopers and aliens on social media, Visma-Lease a Bike hopes that it will make riders faster in time trials“The collaboration with Giro has been without any boundaries, we are really happy,” Paul Martens, the team’s head of rider apparel, said in a video on X, formerly known as Twitter.“Of course, the appearance, you already see that it’s totally different,” he added. “It’s a new way of thinking about the aero helmet and we really think we have found a big improvement in our old system in the TTs [time trials]. Hopefully, we can show it today.”Tour de France champion Jonas Vingegaard was the first Visma-Lease a Bike rider in Monday’s time trial. He finished ninth, 22 seconds behind winner Juan Ayuso of UAE Team Emirates.The helmet caused quite a stir when it first appeared at the race.“It’s a thorn in my eye … a firm no from me on these helmets,” said Eurosport commentator Robbie McEwen. “They’re ridiculous.”In a statement on its website, Visma-Lease a Bike said that it is “very pleased with the new aerodynamic design” and the fact that the helmet meets current safety regulations.However, on Tuesday, the UCI referenced the new design while announcing a review into its rules around helmets in competitions.“The UCI acknowledges that while this may not directly contravene existing UCI Regulations, it raises a significant issue concerning the current and wider trend in time trial helmet design, which focuses more on performance than the primary function of a helmet, namely to ensure the safety of the wearer in the event of a fall,” the statement said.The statement also named the Rudy Project Windgream HL 85 helmet, which has been used by the Bahrain Victorious team, and the POC Tempor helmet, used by a number of teams, when announcing the review.“In view of the evolution of these situations as well as other problems encountered in recent years, in relation to the requirement for commercial availability, the ban on non-essential components and the shape and size of time trial helmets, the UCI will undertake a review of its rules on the design and use of helmets in competition,” the UCI said.In the same statement, the organization announced that “head socks” – balaclavas built into cycling helmets – are set to be banned at international events from next month.The ban, which will be effective from April 2, has been introduced following a review to determine whether the TT5 helmet, manufactured by American company Specialized, aligned with the UCI’s equipment regulations.As part of the review, it was decided that the head sock was deemed a non-essential component.According to Cyclingnews, the TT5 helmet first appearance at the Tour de France in 2022 and has been used regularly since then.Wacky helmet designs are nothing new in cycling, a sport constantly looking to maximize a rider’s aerodynamics over the course of a race. As part of its helmet regulations, the UCI insists that all helmets used by professional riders are also available to the public.CNN has contacted Specialized, Visma-Lease a Bike, Giro and Rudy Project for comment on the UCI’s review into helmet designs."

        "title": "Caitlin Clark: Iowa’s record-breaking basketball supernova who everyone is talking about",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Clark-mania is in full swing – and then some.Known for her unerring sharpshooting ability from deep, the 22-year-old Caitlin Clark has become one of the biggest names ever in college sports as she became the all-time leading scorer in NCAA women’s basketball.Meanwhile, her popularity away from the court knows no bounds.Clark’s University of Iowa jerseys and shirts are online retailer Fanatics’ top-selling college athlete edition since it began selling collegiate athletic apparel in 2022, the website told CNN. She’s also inked deals with Gatorade, Nike and State Farm, among others, recently.With just two games remaining in the college regular season, Clark has an opportunity to go one step further as she sits within touching distance of the all-time scoring record in men’s or women’s NCAA basketball, set by the late Pete Maravich who played at Louisiana State from 1967 to 1970.Clark’s success at the collegiate level has earned her the moniker ‘Ponytail Pete’ – an homage to Maravich’s ‘Pistol’ nickname.Since exploding into the wider public conscious with her unbelievable play throughout March Madness and eventual spat with LSU Tigers forward Angel Reese last year, Clark has developed into the dominant force in college basketball – both men’s and women’s – and her arrival in the WNBA is more a case of when, not if.A native of Des Moines, Iowa, her commitment to her home state university in 2020 has proven a masterstroke for Clark herself, the Hawkeyes and women’s basketball in general.Clark was handed the reins to the Iowa offense almost immediately, averaging almost 27 points as a freshman. In her third season with the team, Iowa reached its first ever NCAA women’s basketball national championship game, though the Hawkeyes eventually lost to LSU.One of the most impressive things about Clark’s career has been her yearly progression. This season, she is averaging just over 32 points – by far the most in her career – with a solid shooting percentage (46.9%), including almost 40% from three-point range.And, as she continued to develop, the attention on her game’s only increased.“I started in a year where it was Covid, and you’re playing in front of just your family and cardboard cutouts,” she told TNT Sports in October 2023.“And now to be in my senior year, playing in front of 15,000 people, it’s special, it’s historic.“It’s not anything that’s really been done in women’s basketball before.”Like Steph Curry in the NBA and Sabrina Ionescu in the WNBA, Clark’s ability to hit defense-breaking three-pointers from way downtown has made her an elite talent as well as a social media darling.A prime example of her skillset came in her record-breaking moment, pulling up from almost the halfcourt logo with no hesitation, a maneuver which she’s used with regularity and has fans gushing over her unique skillset.Despite the attention, Clark has remained grounded, according to long-time Iowa associate head coach Jan Jensen.Jensen remembers Clark saying, “Now, what else can we do?” moments after becoming the all-time top scorer in collegiate women’s basketball.Clark’s popularity is not uncommon among former collegiate stars. Zion Williamson, Kelsey Plum, Anthony Davis, Maya Moore, Allen Iverson, Brittney Griner and Shaquille O’Neal all entered their respective NBA and WNBA Drafts after having become national darlings in the NCAA.What is arguably unique about Clark’s popularity is that that her journey, social media clips and her possible WNBA home are being followed more closely than many of her current male peers on a collegiate level.Such a platform seemingly rests lightly on Clark’s shoulders.“I think I’ve embraced that role of being a name that people can identify women’s sports with really well, I think it’s something that I accept and I’m comfortable doing,” she told TNT Sports in October 2023.“If that’s what’s going to help our game move forward, if that’s what’s going to help women’s sports move forward, it’s just something I want to embrace and enjoy and be an advocate for.”Clark has declared for the WNBA Draft and will likely play for the Indiana Fever after the team won the lottery for the No. 1 overall pick.For a league often in the shadow of its male counterpart, Clark could help open new possibilities in terms of marketing and opportunities for the WNBA to grow.Following the first of its kind three-point competition at this year’s All-Star Game – with NBA pitted against WNBA in ‘Stephen vs. Sabrina’ – some are suggesting an expansion of the format, with Clark thrust in.“Let’s get the four best shooters on the planet,” NBA Hall of Famer and former three-point specialist Reggie Miller said during the 2024 All-Star Game.“Let’s get Damian Lillard and Steph as a team vs. Sabrina and, possibly if she decides to come out (of college), Caitlin Clark, who’s another great sharpshooter. How about those two against Steph and Dame? I would love to see that.”What is undeniable are the eyeballs Clark has brought to college women’s basketball. Every one of her Iowa games is attended by almost 15,000 fans at Carver-Hawkeye Arena, mostly there seemingly to catch a glimpse of the superstar.The cameras follow Clark’s every move during Iowa games, whether on the court or not, as most are there to see what is likely to be her final few games for the team. Even with all that attention, Jensen outlined the joy she plays with.“I tell people all the time about Caitlin, she is special in that she truly has a blast playing this game,” Jensen said.“And at the moment, what’s awesome about Caitlin, when she’s been little five-year-old Caitlin to now, is when she’s playing and whomever is watching – if there’s 10 little kids on the playground, or two, or stadiums – she wants you all to know, at this particular moment, she’s the best there ever was because that’s how she’s wired.“But when it’s over, all those balls that she gets and the trophies, they are the least of her concern. And her eyes sparkle, and she cannot wait to do it again and to just have those moments.”Clark has spoken about how her competitiveness is a trait which has fueled her, but that passion has sometimes grated against others.In last year’s March Madness, Clark was at the center of the biggest talking point of the tournament after LSU’s Reese directed a gesture at her in the closing minutes of the NCAA women’s basketball national championship game.Reese could be seen approaching Clark before moving her open hand in front of her face – widely popularized by WWE star John Cena as a taunt to mean “you can’t see me” – before pointing to her ring finger in a gesture some interpreted as a reference to the place her newly acquired championship ring might sit.Clark made a similar open hand gesture to another player earlier in the tournament.Reese’s actions sparked much debate, especially on social media. Some criticized the LSU star, while others defended her gestures, highlighting how there was no public outrage in response to Clark earlier in the tournament.Clark herself defended Reese afterwards, but the moment divided the sporting landscape in support of her or in opposition.And even recently, Clark has been the subject of some critique.Sheryl Swoopes – one of the WNBA’s pioneers and most successful players – made inaccurate comments on a podcast, saying Clark was a fifth-year player who takes “about 40 shots a game” in an attempt to criticize the Iowa star.Clark is in her fourth year at Iowa and averages 22.7 field goal attempts per game.Swoopes – a three-time WNBA MVP and seven-time All-WNBA player – did later apologize and said she had spoken to Clark directly, but her comments caused a storm in the women’s basketball sphere.A number of Iowa fans wore t-shirts to a recent game with the phrase “Don’t Be A Sheryl,” while Reese weighed in, posting on X – formerly known as Twitter – “I want to be like (Sheryl Swoopes).”ESPN pundit and former Duke Blue Devils star Jay Williams said that while he thinks Clark is “probably the most prolific scorer the game of basketball has ever seen,” he is unable to call her “great yet.”“I’m not saying that she’s not at a high, high, high level,” he said of Clark, “but for it to go to the states of immortality, in my opinion, it has to culminate with your team winning a championship.”Famed college basketball broadcaster Dick Vitale, however, disagrees with that criticism, saying that he didn’t think it was “FAIR to eliminate someone that doesn’t win a championship” and comparing Clark to one of the greatest players the game has ever seen in Wilt Chamberlain.Being at the center of controversy is something all top-level athletes have to deal with and Clark, even through four years of college basketball, is proving no exception and has had to become experienced at handling the attention."

        "title": "He was running the biggest soccer club in Ukraine. After war broke out, his life changed forever",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "The noise of fighter jets zipping overhead is a sound that Serhii Palkin finds difficult to forget – even two years on.Like every Ukrainian, the 49-year-old lived through the “nightmare” that unfolded as Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.While he scrambled to keep his young family safe amid the near constant bombardment, Palkin also had the responsibility of looking after Ukraine’s most successful soccer club, Shakhtar Donetsk.You would never guess Palkin is living through a war when you first meet him. He’s calm, measured and quick to quip a joke as he sits down in an unassuming meeting room in London to reflect on how his personal and professional life has changed forever.“We are all suffering from everything that’s going on. Two years is a huge term to stay in these kinds of conditions … a very big impact on your psychological stability, on your moral aspects,” the softly spoken Palkin tells CNN Sport.“Mentally, it’s difficult to survive, day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month. Almost two years we have been in these kinds of conditions.”Palkin was named Shakhtar Donetsk’s CEO in 2004, taking charge of the most decorated club in Ukraine. In addition to its domestic dominance, the team regularly competes in the UEFA Champions League, alongside the biggest names of the sport.While previously occupied with the daily running of the business, the former accountant now confronts issues of life and death on a daily basis.Soccer, all of a sudden, wasn’t important. People’s lives became the biggest priority.While his own family sought refuge abroad in the early stages of the invasion, Palkin hunkered down in the besieged city of Kyiv and didn’t leave until every one of his players were safely out of harm’s way.Since the conflict began, though, six people with direct ties to the club have died, according to Palkin.“My life completely changed and I started to be involved in crisis management. This is the most important thing I dealt with and deal with now,” he says, explaining the new demands on his role.“Because of the war, we have this crisis everywhere.”By the end of 2022, soccer returned to Ukraine as the country’s Premier League resumed – albeit without fans.While some matches were paused because of air-raid sirens, and despite the obvious risks of staging a competitive sporting event during the invasion, soccer was deemed an important part of the war effort.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said as much, allowing players to travel around Europe in order to represent the country on the global stage.Soccer was now a symbol of hope amid the misery of conflict.Palkin says everything the club did, and still does, is in order to help win the war – whether that be raising money by playing charity matches or providing some good news to the soccer-mad population of Ukraine.“If they allowed us to leave the country in wartime, it means that we need to give huge feedback for people living in Ukraine,” he says, referring to how the club travels to play exhibitions around the world and its home games in Germany.“It means that, yes, you can lose, but you should play from the heart and you should show the best football you can, attacking football, you know, beautiful football, like our DNA.”Shakhtar has certainly done that at times – most recently beating FC Barcelona 1-0 in the Champions League group stage in November.It was a result made all the more impressive given the logistics involved with the club playing games in wartime.In truth, Shakhtar has been an itinerant club since 2014 when it was forced out of its home in the Donbas region amid Russia’s forceful annexation of Crimea. But even this club was tested after the full-scale invasion.With flying in and out of Ukraine impossible, the team often spends days traveling on buses in order to reach their location for matches. Palkin looks exhausted as he reels off the long-list of practicalities that need to be addressed, including ordering food for the team and ensuring they are always as safe as possible.Palkin admits the team is often not on a level playing field when it plays in European competitions. How can a player, for example, be expected to compete at the highest level when he’s just spent two days sitting on a bus?“For us to continue to play football and to concentrate 100% on the game is very difficult because you’re always thinking about what’s going on at home, with your parents, with your family,” he says.“If you look at the life of our players, it’s not normal. Everything that we are doing today in our football life in Ukraine, it’s not normal.“From a physical point of view and from a mental point of view, it’s very difficult to live [let alone] show good, attractive football […] our players have shown themselves like real heroes.”The soccer world has largely stood by Ukraine, showing public signs of support and raising millions of dollars for the relief effort.However, Palkin is critical of world soccer’s governing body, FIFA, who he says has forgotten his club.The root of his criticism lies in FIFA’s decision to adopt a ruling which allowed international players and coaches to suspend their contracts with Ukrainian and Russian clubs.Shakhtar’s strategy has long been focused on bringing young players, notably from Brazil, to the club, developing them and then selling them on for a profit.Former Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho is the perfect example, moving to Ukraine from Brazilian club Atlético Paranaense in 2005 before joining the Premier League giant for around $40 million in 2013.But many of those players, which the club had invested in before the war, left Shakhtar for free as a result of the ruling.Palkin said he was happy to facilitate players leaving the club, but argued the ruling allowed some clubs to take advantage – signing Shakhtar players for nothing, before recouping a profit after moving them on.Palkin says the club was left with debts of over $43 million.Shakhtar was part of a group that appealed FIFA’s decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) but the case was dismissed in January 2023.The club then filed a complaint with the EU’s European Commission last year, as Palkin continues to fight for “justice.” The European Commission told CNN it was “currently assessing” the complaint “based on our standard procedures.”“We are one football family and, if one member of the family has a problem, everybody should support,” says Palkin, praising English Premier League club Chelsea for its conduct when signing young star Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar in 2023, for an initial $75 million.“You see a lot of positive words of support, but in some cases, when you need the support, there is no support.“The situation with FIFA, for me, it’s very strange and not understandable at all.”FIFA referred CNN to the CAS decision when asked for comment.While the war means Palkin is unable to plan for more than a month in advance, his focus is on building the squad back to its former glory.He admitted that signing players amid the uncertainty is difficult, but not impossible. Even when players are keen, he said, it’s another question when it comes to convincing parents and family members to let their child go.“I don’t have any case when we couldn’t sign because of the war. There can be different issues, but the war is not a major one,” he says.Despite all the challenges, the Shakhtar CEO is confident his club can come out of this impossible time in a strong position.Not least because Shakhtar is a team playing for more than just points. Palkin has witnessed how the sport he loves can offer temporary reprieve from the darkest of times and how the money raised from charity matches can have a tangible impact on supporting those trying to rebuild their lives.“Football has unbelievable world level influence,” he says, a smile breaking out on his face.“Believe me, this influence can change anybody and we live through this and we understand this because we feel it and we see the reactions.“It’s above everything, you know? And if we all stay together and go in one way, I can tell you 100% we can positively change any area of humanity.”Shakhtar Donetsk failed to qualify for the knockout rounds of the Champions League this year but dropped into this season’s Europa League, Europe’s secondary club competition, instead.It faces French side Marseille on Thursday in first leg of the play-off match. The game will once again take place in Hamburg, Germany."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "The ATP Tour has announced a new partnership with the Saudi government-controlled Public Investment Fund (PIF).The men’s professional tennis tour announced the deal on Wednesday as a “multi-year strategic partnership” between the two parties.ATP CEO Massimo Calvelli called the arrangement “a major moment for tennis.”“It’s a shared commitment to propel the future of the sport,” Calvelli said.“With PIF’s dedication to the next generation – fostering innovation and creating opportunities for all – the stage is set for a transformative new period of progress.”Mohamed AlSayyad, the head of corporate brand at PIF, added: “This strategic partnership aligns with our broader vision to enhance quality of life and drive transformation in sport both within Saudi and across the world.”While Calvelli hailed the ATP deal, tennis greats Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert are reticent about the reported hosting of the women’s tour WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia, describing any such move as a “step backward.”Earlier this year, Navratilova and Evert wrote in the Washington Post that they were concerned about the kingdom’s record on women’s rights, human rights, and LGBTQ rights.“Not only is this a country where women are not seen as equal, it is a country where the current landscape includes a male guardianship law that essentially makes women the property of men,” said the two former tennis stars.“A country which criminalizes the LGBTQ community to the point of possible death sentences. A country whose long-term record on human rights and basic freedoms has been a matter of international concern for decades,” they added.The kingdom has previously pushed back on allegations of “sportswashing,” which involves countries using high-profile sporting events to project a favorable image of their country around the world, often to draw attention away from alleged wrongdoing.The ATP deal is just the latest move by the PIF when it comes to investing in sport across the globe.Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Daniil Medvedev, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinnner are all due to compete in a new tennis tournament, the “6 Kings Slam,” in the Saudi capital Riyadh in October, according to the Saudi press agency.In 2021, the PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport’s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money. Last year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf.Meanwhile, four PIF-owned soccer teams – Al-Ittihad, Al-Hilal, Al-Nassr and Al-Ahli – spent nearly $900 million (€835.1 million) last year on buying elite international players as the European summer transfer window closed, according to Transfermarkt data.The newly acquired players joined five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr and will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world’s highest paid soccer player.The PIF also leads the investment group which owns English Premier League team Newcastle United. The PIF took over the club in 2021.The PIF is the world’s sixth largest sovereign wealth fund with assets of $776 billion, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute"

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Just two years ago, a cash-strapped Jake Knapp was steering inebriated revelers towards the nightclub exit. On Sunday, the American steered in a putt for almost $1.46 million.Triumph at the Mexico Open secured Knapp a first PGA Tour victory in just his ninth start on the circuit, as the 29-year-old powered to a two-shot victory ahead of fellow rookie Sami Valimaki in Vidanta Vallarta.Knapp saw his four-shot final round lead wiped out inside the first seven holes by the 25-year-old Valimaki, who was bidding to become the first Finnish golfer to win on the PGA Tour, but the American held his nerve to card an even-par 71 and win at 19-under par overall.“I’ll never forget this,” Knapp, who rose 49 places to world No. 52 with the victory, told reporters Sunday.“For the rest of my life, this will be my first win on the PGA Tour. Whether it’s my first win and only one that I ever have or it’s the first of many, this will always be one that I remember.”Knapp won despite hitting just two fairways during the final round, the fewest ever made by a PGA Tour event winner since tracking began in 1983. Given his unorthodox route to the top, it was a fitting conclusion.The University of California – Los Angeles (UCLA) alumni took up work at The Country Club, a restaurant in his home city of Costa Mesa, in 2021 after losing his card on the Korn Ferry Tour, the developmental circuit of the PGA Tour.Needing money, as well as “responsibility and perspective,” Knapp spent eight months working security at the restaurant which doubles as a nightclub – despite initially applying for a role behind the bar, he recalled to the PGA Tour earlier this month.“They needed a security guy, and I was like, ‘I don’t know if I’m big enough, but I can stand there and look tough,’” he said.“I’d work Thursday, Friday, Saturday nights and special events, which allowed me to practice until five or six on Friday, and then go to the gym and eat dinner and go straight there, work until 2 or 3 a.m., come straight home, go to sleep, wake up at 10, course at 11, practice until 5, do it again.“I was thankful I wasn’t living off that job; it helped fund mini-tour stuff and [PGA Tour] Canada that summer. It made me work a little bit harder and not take golf for granted.”The evening before the victory that stamped his ticket to his major debut at The Masters in April, Knapp credited his work experience with giving him a renewed vigor for the sport.“Standing there at 1 in the morning every Friday and Saturday night, you kind of realize how good you have it when you get to travel and play golf for a living,” he told reporters Saturday.“Then also a bit of grittiness – the fact that I don’t want to, necessarily, have to go back to that … I think it just kind of gave me some thicker skin and allowed me to get to where I am now.”Knapp also paid tribute to his late grandfather, Gordon Bowley, who died in April 2023 at age 85 after a battle with colon cancer.Bowley, president of youth sports nonprofit Costa Mesa United, was celebrated as a champion of young sports in the area and was idolized by Knapp, who tattooed his initials – G.S.F.B. – on his left arm to honor him last summer.After an emotional press conference Saturday in which Knapp spoke through tears discussing his relationship with his grandfather, he followed his typical routine Sunday – texting him before and after his round.“I had a little kind of conversation with him this morning and just talked about the day and wish he could be here to watch it and experience all of it,” Knapp said.“I know he’s one of those guys that if I ever kind of got down on myself, ever got nervous or started doing something bad, he would just kind of whack me on the back of the head and be like, ‘C’mon, get to work.’”And what would his response to the victory be?“‘Winner, winner, chicken dinner,’ that’s his go-to,” Knapp said. “I know he would shoot me a text with that, and he’d probably say, ‘Cigars on me when I get home.’”"
