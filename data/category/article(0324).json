        "text": "Darrell Ann Murphy teaches Mahjong at the local library with a dual purpose: to create new fans of the game she loves while also helping keep fellow seniors mentally sharp.She begins class with a rule that has nothing to do with how to play the colorful tiles.“We are all here to learn,” is Murphy’s opener. “We are all here for one reason. And we’re never going to talk religion or politics.”Sitting with us in her Easton home, however, the 83-year-old Murphy is happy to share she is a lifelong Democrat, a moderate, a supporter of abortion rights and fierce critic of Donald Trump.“He actually scares me,” Murphy said of the former president. “I think he does not have the best interest of the country at heart.”Easton is a deep blue city in a bellwether purple county in a battleground state that will be pivotal for both control of the White House and the Senate this year.Northampton County has a history of close races, and a history of picking presidential winners.Trump narrowly carried Northampton in 2016 and his narrow win in Pennsylvania was a critical piece of his Electoral College victory. Joe Biden flipped the script in 2020.Murphy shrugs off a conservative who says Biden – at 81 – is too old, dismissing such talk as partisanship. But other recent conversations have her more than a little nervous about the county’s 2024 leanings.“When I start talking about Joe Biden and how I admire and respect him, I get plenty of blowback,” Murphy said. “Plenty of blowback. ‘He is too old. Kamala Harris, forget her.’ Blowback. Now these are people who do not necessarily love Trump. But they talk about wanting a better choice.”Our visit to Easton is the latest stop in a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters in key states or demographic groups. Voters over the age of 65 are the most reliable voting group, and in the nail-biting battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, their support can prove decisive.An afternoon game of Mahjong at Murphy’s home is instructive: Even aging voters are divided over the 2024 age debate.Catherine Long is a fan of Murphy’s rule forbidding talk of religion and politics.“We can’t do that and play the game at the same time,” she said.Friend Mary Ann Horvath added that the policy is wise even when not focusing on pairing Mahjong tiles.“I hardly talk politics with anybody because you just don’t know what the other person believes,” Horvath said. That, everyone at the table agreed, is different from, say, 10 or 20 years ago – when you could debate politics without risking friendships.“Feelings are so much stronger now,” Horvath said.Still, a visitor decides to break the rule, and asks if anyone at the table would prefer younger candidates for president.The divide is immediate.“I think there should be an age limit at the top,” is the view of Pamela Aita.Murphy disagreed and recalled recently attending a friend’s 100th birthday party. “Shirley knows just what is going on politically,” Murphy said. “A lot of older people now are pretty darn sharp.”Aita was not persuaded.“But they are not running the country,” she said. “That person should be able to speak. That person should know who they are speaking to. That person should be able to know simple things that you and I would know. And I don’t think the person in charge of this country at this time is capable of that.”Long offered what she called the counter argument, pointing to the 77-year-old former president: “Donald Trump can’t know the difference between Nancy Pelosi and Nancy Haley.”Murphy was quick with the correction: “Nikki Haley.”“Nikki Haley,” Long repeated. “I get even those confused.”As laughter broke out, Long added this about her memory mixup: “This is what happens.”Larry Malinconico offered a take similar to what we heard from Murphy: He is a Biden fan and sees the age debate as a distraction.“I don’t think he has gotten appropriate credit for the things he has done,” Malinconico said.But he worries enough of his peers and some of his students do see Biden’s age as disqualifying, and he knows what even modest shifts in voter sentiment can mean in Northampton County and Pennsylvania.“I’d be more discouraged this year, at this point, about Trump being elected over Biden,” he said.Malinconico, 71, is a geology professor at Lafayette College in Easton. He is energetic and engaging in the classroom and says his views on age are shaped by his teaching and watching his father live to 94.“I don’t think that age is necessarily a determining factor,” Malinconico said in an interview at his campus office.Still, when we ask if he would have preferred that Biden had decided to serve just one term, and announced that months ago, the answer is, “Yes, I would.”Why?“I think there are people who will not vote for him or sit out because they perceive his age as a potential problem,” Malinconico said. “He looks physically more frail than he did a decade ago or two decades ago. And unfortunately, I think people equate physical frailty with lack of mental acuity. And I think that is wrong.”Malinconico listed reading, Wordle, crossword puzzles and physical activity when we asked what he does to stay sharp. Yes, a memory mixup now and then. But he said he believes his experience makes him a better teacher now than he was 10 or 20 years ago. “I hope to be learning until I die,” he said.Mickey Brown is West Point Class of 1966, which makes him 80. He plays tennis, pickleball and senior softball at this over-55 community in Hanover Township and says Sudoku and reading are his go-tos to keep his mind sharp.Three or four times a week he spends most of the day at a care center where his wife lives because of her dementia.“It’s just something you have to do,” he said, tearing up. “I believe in Jesus and God. I think it keeps me strong and I’ll be fine. And I want to make sure she is taken care of as well as she can be.”Brown is a conservative and two-time Trump voter. But he insists his worries about Biden are based on his experience, not his politics.“Caring for my wife, I see certain things in the way, his mannerisms, that make me wonder if he is really in fact the president,” Brown said.We reminded Brown that Trump, too, often meanders into verbal tangents and of recent episodes where he, at length, mixed up Haley and Pelosi and suggested the former South Carolina governor was somehow in charge of the US Capitol when Trump supporters stormed it on January 6, 2021.“At times I forget something,” Brown said. “Comes back. But I’m fit, I have confidence in myself. I just think the differences between the two are enough for me to be more concerned about Mr. Biden going forward than Mr. Trump.”Pat Levin calls Brown a friend. But she disagrees vehemently with his politics and with his take on Biden’s fitness to serve.“Donald Trump is essentially the same age and makes similar errors,” Levin said. “So I don’t fault Joe Biden. I think that’s just part of life. We are not infallible.”Levin was precise when asked her age: “94 and a half.”We met her at the SteelCore Studio in Bethlehem, where she comes once a week for a workout of crunches, balance exercises and more.“This is important for – to keep me vertical,” Levin said with a playful smile. “At my age I need all the help I can get.”Levin is a lifelong Democrat who is well aware of Northampton County’s bellwether legacy but also tends to forget it on a day-to-day basis, not because of any memory issues but because she generally is in the company of fellow Democrats.“To be honest with you, that always surprises me,” Levin said of Northampton’s history. “Because you tend to spend time with people who think the way we do. So, I think everybody is for Joe Biden until November comes. Then it surprises me.”The president’s age, she said, hardly ever comes up when she is in the company of friends who are about as old as Biden or even, like her, about a dozen years older.“They’re terrified of what might happen if Joe Biden doesn’t win,” Levin said.Terrified of what?“What will happen to this democracy.”Election Day is more than eight months away. Levin would be 95 then. Every crunch at SteelCore is her way of saying age is just a number, and she argues Biden should be judged by his performance, period.“I don’t think age should be a determinant of competence,” Levin said. “I don’t think they go together in any way, shape, or form. I know a lot of young people who are quite incompetent. I know a lot of older people who are very competent. And Joe Biden falls into that category for me.”"

        "title": "Dreams of his basketball court: Obama sees All Star hoops at his presidential library",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The hoop and change president is enshrining his love for basketball in his presidential library.The Obama Presidential Center that will rise in Jackson Park in Chicago will feature an athletic complex with a full-size court that the ex-president describes in a new podcast. Its unorthodox inclusion in a presidential library complex will underscore how Obama’s love for the game was a key part of his image, his appeal to younger voters and a useful political tool.“It will also be the first presidential center in which there will be multiple All Star games on there,” Obama said on the new “Ways to Win” podcast hosted by his brother-in-law Craig Robinson and University of Kentucky coach John Calipari.But the youngest living former president won’t be lacing them up himself once his court is inaugurated. The shot clock runs down for everyone – even for ex-commanders in chief. Obama, 62, confessed on the podcast that he no longer plays the competitive games of pickup he used to blow off steam as president after seeing friends of a similar age popping their Achilles tendons.“I have hung ‘em up,” Obama said. “I played all the way through the presidency,” before adding, “the last time I played was November of 2016, so just two months before I left office. Man, I played great that day. I was raining down threes, and had this spin move, finger roll for the win. I was just firing on all cylinders.”Almost every recent president has enjoyed a round of golf, including Obama. Ex-President Donald Trump, who used to slam his predecessor for the time he spent on the links, was an obsessive player on his own courses while in office. And President Joe Biden, who has kept his love for the game somewhat quieter, is reputedly – alongside President John Kennedy – one of the best presidential golfers. President Bill Clinton, meanwhile, was a famed jogger.But it’s rare for a president to play a team sport. And since the sitting president is 81 and the presumptive GOP nominee is 77, it’s unlikely to happen again soon.These days, Obama’s most public connection with the game he loves is through his March Madness brackets that have a huge post-presidential audience on social media. Ahead of this year’s event that begins on Thursday, the ex-president picks UConn to beat Kentucky in the final of the men’s tournament and has South Carolina beating Caitlin Clark’s Iowa in the women’s final.“The first year I did this, 2009, right? I’d been sworn in. And I picked North Carolina. … And they won,” Obama said. “And my bracket was beautiful and people were pretty impressed. They thought, ‘Look at the President United States. He’s in the top 4% of all the people who enter in their brackets publicly.’ And I was kind of feeling it, and I thought, ‘You know what, I think this is what’s going to happen every year.’”Obama added: “And I’m pretty sure each year I’ve lost since then. So, I have not necessarily picked a winner.”His playing days might be over, but as his bracket choices show, basketball remains what it always was for Obama even before he ran for president – a conduit to a wider audience that adds a dash of cool to his persona.Early in his political career, Obama viewed himself almost like the star of an NBA team – who can sink the big shots under huge pressure. It was audacious and maybe arrogant. But it gave an up-and-coming politician some swagger.“I’m LeBron, baby. I can play on this level. I got some game,” the then-nationally unknown Obama told the journalist David Mendell before the 2004 Democratic National Convention speech in Boston that made him a political rock star.From the start, Obama’s fondness for basketball – and the fact he was fit and young enough to play it – was used by his campaign as a way to shape an image of a vigorous and athletic candidate and to stress the passing of a torch to a new political generation. It became widely known that he would play basketball with aides as he waited for the results of his primary races against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. During a tour of the Middle East to demonstrate he could handle foreign policy, then-Sen. Obama drained a long-range shot in front of a gym full of US service members in Kuwait. The subsequent television reports featuring his triumph didn’t do him any harm at all.Once at the White House, Obama converted the White House tennis court so it could be used as a basketball court. Some of his favorite events appeared to be his yearly receptions for the NBA Champions. In 2010, for instance, the 44th president met the late Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers at the White House and they presented him with a yellow jersey with his name on the back.Obama’s physical games of pickup basketball with Cabinet members, aides and others brought in to make up the numbers soon became one of the hottest tickets in Washington. They often took place at a military base or government building near the White House. Sometimes he played on the court in the presidential mansion’s backyard. On one notorious occasion in 2010, the famously sharp-elbowed president came off worse in an encounter with an opposing player – a Capitol Hill aide – and ended up with stitches to his mouth.But even the self-confident Obama sometimes missed his shot. The former president was once embarrassed when he kept hitting the rim while playing on the basketball court on the South Lawn of the White House and he was spotted by a pool of chuckling reporters. He kept trying until he eventually made the basket.Sometimes the then-president would coach one of his daughters’ school basketball games. In 2012, he used March Madness as a diplomatic backdrop, taking British Prime Minister David Cameron to a game in Dayton, Ohio. On the way back to Washington on Air Force One, Obama offered his weary guest the use of the presidential bed in the nose of the aircraft, saying, “I bet Roosevelt never did this for Churchill,” according to Cameron’s memoir. On another occasion in November 2011, Obama marked Veterans Day at a Michigan State-North Carolina basketball game played on the deck of a moored aircraft carrier in San Diego harbor.Even though he’s no longer seen on the hardboard, Obama has still got game. While campaigning with Biden in Michigan in 2020, he scored a walk off three-pointer in a gym and was clearly delighted, saying, “That’s what I do. That’s what I do.”On the “Ways to Win” podcast, the former president drew some analogies between his experience at the highest level of politics and basketball coaches who are trying to motivate their college teams this week.“Don’t get too high when things are going good. Don’t get too low when things are going bad. That feels right to me in terms of leadership,” Obama said.That’s some advice to offer Biden as he embarks on a tough reelection race, when the pair appears together at a virtual election rally this weekend to tout the Affordable Care Act on its 14th anniversary."

        "title": "Will Biden and Trump debate? The brief history and uncertain future of presidential debates",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "To debate or not to debate is a complicated question for President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump as they barrel into an eight-month general election.Trump’s position: On social media, Trump promised he would debate Biden “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE.” He reiterated that commitment Sunday, telling Fox News that he would do it “anytime, anyplace” and would “even debate minutia.” It is a bold claim that is not backed up by Trump’s record.He failed to participate in any of the Republican National Committee-sponsored primary debates in this election cycle. He’s also the only modern, major-party nominee to back out of a general election debate, during the pandemic four years ago.The RNC voted in 2022 to end its relationship with the nonpartisan system that has sponsored general election debates since the 1988 presidential campaign. Trump has since cleaned house at the RNC. More on that later.Biden’s position: Biden only faced token primary opposition this year, and the Democratic National Committee didn’t sponsor any primary debates. But he has remained coy about whether he will debate Trump in the general election.“I don’t know if he’s serious,” Biden told CNN after the Gridiron Dinner on Saturday when asked whether he expects to debate the former president ahead of the 2024 election. “I don’t know if he’s serious.”Whether either man will show up to the debate stage is an open question, but there is a detailed plan for three presidential debates and a vice presidential one already in place from the Commission on Presidential Debates. It’s a nonpartisan organization that has leaders from both sides of the political aisle and gets funding from the communities that host debates and also “to a lesser extent, from corporate, foundation and private donors,” per its website.For more on the context and history of presidential debates, I talked on the phone with two experts:Here’s what to know about the US presidential debate system:SCHROEDER: The history in a nutshell is basically that there were four debates in 1960 between (John F.) Kennedy and (Richard) Nixon. Those were sponsored by the TV networks. And then there were no more until 1976.In ’76, the president was Gerald Ford. He had come into office because of Nixon’s resignation. So he was in kind of a weak position. He’s the one that actually challenged Jimmy Carter to debates, and that set in place this tradition that has existed ever since then of presidential debates.There was one year, 1980, where there was only one debate between (Ronald) Reagan and Carter, but normally there are two or three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate per cycle.The other thing that has changed is the sponsorship. Since 1988, the Commission on Presidential Debates has been the sponsor of the debates.(Note: Before the commission was formed, debates were organized either by TV networks or between campaigns.)While we don’t yet know the exact format or topics for the debates or who will moderate them, the commission announced the schedule last November:There are legitimate questions about whether debates should happen earlier, particularly when so many voters now tend to cast early ballots – something the commission addressed by scheduling the final debate of this cycle for nearly a month before Election Day.The commission selects these debate locations after accepting bids from locations, which are almost always college campuses.The commission sets criteria for candidates to meet, and Republicans and Democrats are usually the only candidates to qualify.In the commission era, the only non-major-party candidate to take part in debates was Ross Perot in 1992. Perot was not included when he ran again in 1996.For a candidate like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or a Libertarian, Green Party or No Labels candidate to meet the threshold, he or she would have to be constitutionally eligible to serve as president; appear on the ballot in enough states to mathematically win the election; and get at least 15% support in national polling from five different polling organizations selected by the commission.SCHROEDER: The beauty of debates is it’s the only time during these lengthy, two-year-long campaigns where you see the candidates next to each other and confronting each other.I think that’s a really important piece of any election, because it’s so different from everything else. It’s the one moment when the campaigns aren’t in complete control … which is why candidates don’t particularly like debates.SCHROEDER: Rather than change the outcome of the elections, debates tend to, as you said, confirm the existing perceptions that people have of candidates – especially in this day and age when, frankly, there aren’t that many undecided voters left.SCHROEDER: I think they motivate voters. Maybe you’ve already decided you prefer one candidate over the other. But does that mean you actually go out and vote?If you watch the debate and you’re fired up by a strong performance or scared by what the other candidate is saying, then the debate could conceivably lead you to vote.We have to remember that the ratings for debates are enormous. Typically, in years when debates occur, they’re the second-highest rated programs after the Super Bowl.Smart politicians can use the debate as a platform in front of tens and tens of millions of people to overcome negative perceptions that exist about them, or conversely, to reinforce the negative perceptions about their opponents.(Note: Around 73 million people watched the first debate between Trump and Biden in 2020, when it was broadcast on 16 channels. Many more probably watched online or encountered snippets. A record 84 million watched the first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016.)KALL: Going back to the first one, Nixon, he was in a car accident and he didn’t perform very well. People thought Kennedy looked better. Kennedy won.(Note: Nixon was hospitalized for weeks before the debate due to an infection that developed after he hit his knee against a car door.)Gerald Ford made a mistake about the Russian presence in Europe. (Ford lost to Carter in 1976.)Ronald Reagan won a landslide reelection. He had a really good zinger answering concerns about his age. (Reagan defeated Walter Mondale in 1984.)George H.W. Bush, looking at his watch, seeming out of touch, got dinged in 1992.Bill Clinton was great at connecting with the audience and with the questioners in the town hall format. (Ross Perot was also on the stage. Clinton won the three-person election.)People didn’t like Al Gore sighing and that hurt him. (Gore got more votes, but lost the election in 2000.)Barack Obama did terribly in his first debate against Mitt Romney. He was even down in some polls, and then had to really come back for debates two and three to try to win that election. (Obama won reelection in 2012, but it’s also worth recalling Biden’s strong vice presidential debate against Sarah Palin in 2008.)SCHROEDER: We watched him at the State of the Union address last week and not only did he get through it, and it was a long speech, but then he hung out for another hour afterwards. Just glad-handing with people in the chambers.But you’re right. It’s a very physically exacting thing to have to do, to be on your game for 90 minutes uninterrupted. General election debates don’t typically have commercials on like the primary debates, so you don’t even have a bathroom break.Debates are always risky. They’re risky even for people at the top of their game or people who are really good at debates, simply because unscripted politicians at that level are not used to operating in an ad-libbed environment.KALL: I think they both face risk, although at this time, I think Trump probably faces a little more risk, partly because of the expectations that he’s created.He’s been so eager about wanting to debate. If he doesn’t totally crush Biden on the debate stage, then it could look like a loss, and President Biden’s kind of benefited from low expectations his entire political career.SCHROEDER: In 2020, there were only two debates. There were three scheduled, but the second one, the middle one, got canceled because it was during Covid. And the commission decided to do it as a virtual debate instead of an in-person debate. And so Trump basically said I don’t want to do that.So there were only two that year. But of course Trump did do debates against Biden, as well as against Hillary Clinton in 2016.(Note: Trump was still recuperating from Covid-19 when the second debate was canceled in 2020. Four days before the second debate was canceled and 10 days before it was to have taken place, he returned to the White House from being treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The commission wanted to do the town-hall style debate virtually, in part because it was not clear if Trump was still contagious. Biden’s campaign refused to move that debate even closer to Election Day.)KALL: The big barrier, I thought, to having debates this cycle was Trump’s aversion to the Commission on Presidential Debates and the RNC’s aversion to them. But he seems to have kind of backtracked on that, or he just thinks that he wants to beat Biden so much that he’s willing to put that aside, because he thinks he benefits so much from debates and Biden would make a disqualifying gaffe.Trump has long argued the commission is biased, even though multiple Republicans are involved with it.The RNC withdrew from cooperating with the commission in 2022, although Trump has since cleaned house at the RNC, streamlining the organization with his campaign and installing a new chair and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as co-chair.It remains to be seen if Trump will indeed make use of the commission debates or propose some other platform, or if Biden will agree to debate Trump.Trump has a history of complaining about debate moderators who he frequently argues are biased. At one point in 2016, Trump suggested debates proceed without moderators. But a candidate would have to be completely confident of victory to forego general election debates altogether.SCHROEDER: It would be really hard for either candidate to walk away from an audience of 70 to 80 million people, which would be the largest opportunity that either of them would have to make their case before the public, so I remain optimistic.I really would hate to see us not have a cycle with debates, because then I think that it becomes harder to restart things in the future.This story has been updated with new reporting."

        "title": "4 years, 1.2 million lives and trillions of dollars later, a rematch",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Americans may feel like they’re reliving 2020, with a general election rematch set for 2024. But while the politicians’ faces are the same, life is much different.On March 13, 2020, then-President Donald Trump declared a national emergency for the Covid-19 pandemic.No one knew at the time exactly how much life was about to change. Reading CNN’s coverage from that era, however, is like transporting oneself back to the time that so many people have either forgotten or want to block out. We had no idea what was coming.But it’s equally remarkable, precisely four years later, how Covid-19 has both changed American life and also faded to the background.Lockdowns, face masks and the question of whether kids should be in the classroom were daily, top-of-mind issues that had very real impacts on how people voted in 2020. The special measures states took to ensure that more people could vote during the pandemic formed the basis of the conspiracy theories by which Trump today refuses to believe he lost back then.Nearly 1.2 million people in the US have died from Covid-19 during the past four years, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While mass outbreaks and hospitalizations appear to be over, there were still at least 500 people who died of Covid-19 per week as of the week ending March 2. In January of this year, more than 2,000 Americans died of Covid-19 each week.The US government acknowledges spending about $4.4 trillion to address Covid-19, a shocking figure in hindsight that spiked the national debt.That doesn’t count the trillions in extraordinary measures undertaken by the Federal Reserve, which added more than $4 trillion to its balance sheet during the pandemic.People can debate what role the federal spending had on inflation, but it also helped stabilize the country at a time of unprecedented uncertainty when the US economy essentially shut down. It’s remarkable to consider that in exit polls for the 2020 presidential election, 44% of voters said the pandemic caused them no financial hardship at all.Inflation that spiked after people emerged from lockdown has begun to ease, but Americans still have trouble making ends meet despite better wages.Higher interest rates make homebuying seem out of reach to many. Empty office buildings and the uncertain state of commercial real estate means the aftereffects of the pandemic are not yet entirely known.Other countries have a lot more adapting left to do. Read about how many Covid-19 precautions are just being lifted in China, which maintained a draconian zero-Covid policy that locked out the world for years.President Joe Biden felt the need to jog people’s memories during his State of the Union address that the pandemic first struck when Trump was president.“Remember the fear. Record job losses. Remember the spike in crime. And the murder rate,” Biden said last week, trying to flip the script on complaints about public safety in recent years. He added, “The pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccines that saved us from Covid are now being used to help beat cancer. Turning setback into comeback.”Trump, offering live commentary on the speech on his social media platform, wanted credit for Covid-19 vaccines.“YOU’RE WELCOME, JOE,” he wrote, adding that vaccines were developed quickly while he was in office – although presumably any president would have done everything possible to aid the development of vaccines.The more interesting development from that post was the instant backlash Trump got from some of his normal allies who are vaccine skeptics. One constant in Trump’s 2024 stump speeches is his pledge to strip public money from any school district that imposes a vaccine requirement on students. His campaign argues he only means the Covid-19 vaccine, but vaccine skepticism is growing in the US, as are outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles.One new voice gaining attention in presidential politics is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the vaccine skeptic who rivals Trump in his embrace of conspiracy theories and is trading on his famous name to run as an independent candidate. Kennedy draws 15% of the vote in some polls. Kennedy and the super PAC that supports him are targeting swing states as they gather signatures to appear on the presidential ballot.A recent Pew Research Center survey shows a decline in concern among Americans. According to CDC data, less than 23% of US adults reported getting the most recent, recommended dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.Only a little more than a quarter of adults (28%) said they were up to date on the latest Covid-19 vaccine.There is an expected partisan divide in those figures: 42% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are up to date compared with 15% of Republicans and GOP leaners.On the other hand, the partisan gap in concern about the coronavirus has shrunk. Most people in both parties do not see Covid-19 as a major public health threat. The official US public health emergency ended in the US in May 2023.The physical threat of the disease has diminished, which led the CDC to recently drop recommendations that people who contract it isolate for multiple days. Now the government suggestions are in line with those of other respiratory infections. People who get Covid-19 should stay home only until they have been fever-free without medication for at least 24 hours and had improving symptoms for 24 hours.In changing the guidelines, CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said most of the US population has some immunity against Covid and that large waves of infections have given way to smaller and more predictable bumps in the summer and winter. Read more from CNN’s Brenda Goodman.Covid is still a challenging disease for many. In addition to the predictable seasonal bumps, studies suggest large numbers of Americans are dealing with long Covid.More than 9% of women who contracted Covid during pregnancy reported having symptoms six months or more after they were infected, according to one study. Pregnant women might actually get long Covid at lower rates than the general population.Another study looked at the effect on children, up to 6 million of whom have developed long Covid. Children may not get over the physical symptoms of long Covid for more than a year, but there may be compounding effects if they miss out on a year or more of experience while they recuperate. A survey from late last year found that nearly 1 million US children and nearly 18 million US adults reported symptoms of long Covid. Read more from CNN’s Jen Christensen.Every child who was alive during the Covid era will have been affected by that formative experience.A New York Times review of testing data earlier this year suggested there was a rebound in 2023 from Covid learning loss, the well-documented drop in test scores after so many students spent so long away from the physical classroom.But the rebound is far from complete, and it is more pronounced in richer school districts – evidence for the obvious takeaway that the pandemic will have driven financial inequality particularly for children.One controversial move Democrats made when they doubled down on Covid relief without Republicans in the early days of the Biden administration was to create a temporary, new benefit that put money in the pockets of low-income parents by expanding the child tax credit and making it “refundable.” The payments temporarily raised millions of American kids out of poverty.But inflation spiked and public sentiment turned on public safety net expansions, and the tax credit expansion expired. Democrats could not marshal the votes to extend it. Biden made the pitch to bring the expanded tax credit back (paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy) in his State of the Union address. The House recently passed a bill to expand the credit – along with sweeteners for businesses – but it’s not clear if the Senate will act.We still do not know exactly how the coronavirus developed. There is a remarkable amount of circumstantial evidence that points to some kind of lab leak in Wuhan, China.But serious questions remain about when and how researchers in China first discovered the existence of the coronavirus. The lack of transparency by the Chinese government has fed the so-called lab leak theory.The scientific mystery remains. And the national security mystery remains too. In June, CNN reported the US Intelligence committee is still split over whether the virus developed in a lab or in the wild, and no one trusts China to share all of the information.That kind of mistrust is a problem, according to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization. He told CNN’s Becky Anderson in February in Dubai that the world is not ready for “Disease X,” the unknown pathogen that could bring the next pandemic.“We’re not prepared because still many of the problems we have seen during the pandemic are still there,” he said, calling on countries to do more to share information and technology."

        "text": "President Joe Biden is opening a new line of attack against former President Donald Trump this week, flipping the script on the classic Reagan-era “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” question to remind voters of life during his predecessor’s tenure.Ronald Reagan used the question to great effect in his race against then-President Jimmy Carter: In their lone debate of the 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan posed the searing question to voters in his closing statement, “It might be well if you ask yourself - Are you better off than you were four years ago?” Since then, it has often been used to attack incumbents running for reelection – but Biden appears ready to use the question to remind voters of how Trump’s term ended.Biden campaign officials are making a concerted effort to refresh voters’ memories of Trump’s time in office, including his approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, as they prepare for a re-match against him in November. Trump’s campaign has sought to use the question to draw its own contrasts with Biden recently on the economy and immigration.Biden previewed the new messaging push at a Dallas fundraiser Wednesday evening, saying “Speaking of Donald Trump, just a few days ago he asked a famous question in one of his rallies. Are you better off today than you were four years ago?’”“Well, Don, I’m glad you asked that question, man,” Biden said.He then ticked through the state of the US in March of 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic sent the country into isolation, crippled the health care system and economy, and eventually resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans while “Trump tried to downplay the virus,” Biden said.“Covid had come to America. Trump was president,” he said. “Hospitals, emergency rooms were overcrowded. First responders were risking their lives. Nurses were wearing garbage bags because they couldn’t have the protection in the hospitals they needed. And there was a ventilator shortage.”“Morgues were being setup outside, not just in the hospitals, and the loved ones were dying all alone. You couldn’t even say goodbye to them,” Biden continued. “Unemployment shot up to 14% and the stock market crashed. Grocery store shelves were empty.”Biden also took aim at Trump for his treatment of racial justice protestors in the wake of George Floyd’s death along with his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection before turning the page to how the country has recovered from the pandemic during his own presidency.“So let me ask you. Does anyone here want to go back to 2020?” he said. “When fear ruled our lives when Trump was president? I don’t think so.”Biden’s campaign followed those fundraiser remarks with a new digital ad around the issue on Thursday. The 40-second digital spot features a social media post of Trump posing the same question while showing images of empty shelves in grocery stores, and Trump, speaking from the White House podium, touting his administration’s response against images of people in hospitals.The ad concludes with a boldfaced, “Yes.”It’s the latest effort by the Biden campaign to remind voters of Trump’s time in office as they anticipate a close race against the former president in November. Recent polling has reflected a tight contest between the two men on the national level and in key battleground states.On Thursday at a fundraiser in Houston, Biden joked about Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, building on his remarks Wednesday that Americans are better off on his watch than they were four years ago.Biden reminded a crowd of donors that Trump suggested Americans “inject bleach” as a cure.“I think he must have done it,” he said, according to pool reports from the off-camera fundraiser, prompting laughter. “He told us, ‘Hit the body with the UV light,’ which I’m confident he does.”Trump made those comments early in the pandemic in April 2020 during a televised press briefing at the White House, questioning whether disinfectants could be used to treat the virus and musing whether there’s “a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning.”At the same briefing, Trump said, “There’s been a rumor that – you know, a very nice rumor – that you go outside in the sun or you have heat and it does have an effect on other viruses,” before asking coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx “to speak to the medical doctors to see if there’s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure, you know, if you could.”Earlier this year, Biden campaign officials said they believed many undecided voters still did not think a Biden-Trump face-off would occur in November. But they think many voters are now beginning to pay more attention to the race as Trump has formally secured his party’s nomination.One of the challenges for the Biden campaign going forward is reminding voters who felt anxious about Trump’s presidency of that period in time. Biden seemed to acknowledge that challenge as he met with campaign workers and volunteers in Reno, Nevada, this week and lamented the “nostalgia” some voters have for the Trump presidency.“In the coming months, Kamala and I will be making the case how Americans are better off than four years ago,” Biden said at the annual Gridiron Club Dinner in Washington, DC, on Saturday. “How we got so much though the pandemic, turned around the economy, reestablished America’s leadership in the world all without encouraging the American people to inject bleach.”“All without destroying the economy, embarrassing us around the world or itching for insurrection,” he added. “Look, I wish these were jokes but they’re not.”The 40th president used the line as a zinger in the closing statement of a 1980 presidential debate as he faced off against an unpopular incumbent in Carter.“Is it easier for you to go buy things in the store than it was four years ago. Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago” he continued. “Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe? That we’re as strong as we were four years ago?”“If you don’t agree, if you don’t think that this course that we’ve been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have,” he said.One week later, Reagan defeated Carter in a landslide, winning 489 electoral votes.While Biden is trying to turn the tables on Trump’s use of the phrase, he – like Carter in 1980 – is still dealing with his own popularity issues, including pessimistic views on his handling of the economy. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS in January found only 35% of Americans said things in the country today are going well, though it marked an improvement from the 28% who felt positively about the state of affairs last fall.The Trump campaign has leaned into the phrase as well with the former president posting on Truth Social this week, “ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO?”But some Republicans appear to see the limits to using that phrase, especially as the calendar turns toward spring when it harkens back to the tumult of the early 2020 Covid-era. When Alabama Sen. Katie Britt delivered the Republican response to the State of the Union, she instead told voters to think back to the start of Biden’s presidency, not Trump’s term: “Just ask yourself, are you better off now than you were three years ago?”Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016, leaned into the Reagan-era question to troll her former opponent on social media.“Multiple indictments and half a billion dollars in civil liability later, pretty much the only person who can say they were better off four years ago is Donald Trump,” she wrote on X."

        "title": "Blinken warns of stakes of Rafah offensive as Netanyahu again vows to press ahead",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken emerged from meetings in Tel Aviv emphasizing his clear warning to the Israeli government about the perilous stakes of an incursion into Rafah, but with little evidence that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intends to heed his words.The top US diplomat told Netanyahu and the war cabinet Friday that the US remains committed to the “lasting defeat of Hamas, including in Rafah,” but “a major military ground operation in Rafah is not the way to do it.”“It risks further isolating Israel around the world and jeopardizing its long-term security and standing,” Blinken told reporters after his meetings Friday. “It risks killing more civilians, it risks wreaking greater havoc with the provision of humanitarian assistance.”The top US diplomat’s “candid conversations” with the prime minister and the war cabinet were the latest attempt by the Biden administration to pressure the Netanyahu government into changing course after five and a half months of war. Frustrations and impatience on the US side are becoming increasingly apparent in rhetoric from top administration officials, including Blinken, President Joe Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris.Still, there are few signs that the pressure is having an impact on Netanyahu.Following his meeting with Blinken Friday, the Israeli Prime Minister’s message on Rafah was unchanged, as he once again vowed he would launch a military offensive into the Gazan city where more than a million people have fled.“I told him that I hope we will do it with the support of the USA, but if we have to - we will do it alone,” Netanyahu said in a video statement.The ongoing divergence between the US and Israeli governments threatens to further fray the relationship at a time when intensive diplomatic work is underway to broker a “sustained and immediate ceasefire” in exchange for the release of hostages held by Hamas. The divisions suggest it will be difficult to make progress in talks next week about “different ways” to move forward in Rafah.US pressure has also yielded few results on the humanitarian front, as the top US diplomat once again called on the Israeli government to do more to allow critically-needed assistance into Gaza.Blinken said he pushed the government officials on “the imperative of surging and sustaining humanitarian assistance for the people in Gaza,” noting that “one hundred percent” of the population “is in need of humanitarian assistance.”Blinken discussed with the Netanyahu government the ongoing hostage negotiations, the latest round of which kicked off in Doha on Friday. He also met with the families of some of those hostages, as well as demonstrators in Tel Aviv calling for their immediate release.Blinken on Friday noted that “we’ve made progress in the last couple of weeks on the hostage negotiations, closing gaps, but almost by definition, when you get down to the last items, they tend to be the hardest, so there’s still a lot of work to be done.”The top US diplomat’s stop in Tel Aviv capped his sixth round of shuttle diplomacy in the region since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. It followed visits to Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where Blinken met with a coalition of Arab foreign ministers to discuss the situation.“There’s not only more consensus on the priorities – ceasefire, release of hostages, humanitarian assistance, and a clear pathway planned for the future – I think there is increasingly consensus on the steps needed to achieve that,” Blinken said Thursday.Blinken’s visit to Israel also coincided with a vote at the UN on a US-sponsored Security Council resolution calling for an “immediate ceasefire” in the Gaza conflict.The resolution was the first time the US had taken to the UN body to call for a ceasefire in the conflict, but they specifically tied the ceasefire to the release of the hostages held by Hamas.“This Resolution is an opportunity for the Council to speak with one voice to support the diplomacy happening on the ground and pressure Hamas to accept the deal on the table,” Nate Evans, the spokesperson for the US Mission to the UN, told CNN Thursday prior to the vote.Russia and China vetoed the measure on Friday – a move sharply condemned by US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield.“Once again, Russia put politics over progress,” Thomas-Greenfield said after the vote."

        "title": "The push to put Trump back in the White House is getting a boost from people he pardoned before leaving",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "If not for a pardon from Donald Trump in the final weeks of his presidency, Paul Manafort might still be serving a federal sentence. Instead, Trump’s former campaign manager is a free man – and free to help his old boss get back to the White House.Manafort is in discussions to assist the Republican National Convention this summer where Trump will officially become the party’s presidential nominee once again, CNN and other outlets reported this week. His anticipated involvement would make Manafort the latest beneficiary of clemency under Trump to assist the former president’s political comeback.He is far from the first.More than a dozen people pardoned of their crimes or who had their sentences commuted by Trump have since aided the former president as he seeks a return to power. Some have donated their considerable wealth to the cause. A handful endure on the periphery of his political operation as purveyors of Trump’s false conspiracies about the 2020 election, like former top adviser Steve Bannon. Others are outspoken backers with considerable followings, such as rapper Kodak Black, conservative writer and Trump biographer Conrad Black and Phil Lyman, a former US representative now running for Utah governor.One GOP consultant who received a pardon, John Tate, made more than $70,000 last year consulting for Trump’s presidential campaign, federal records show.It is remarkable for a presidential candidate to benefit from the people whom he granted legal forgiveness — a reality that is reflective of both the unprecedented nature of Trump’s third White House bid and his norm-shattering use of presidential authority while in office. As president, Trump exercised his clemency powers unlike any of his predecessors, freeing and forgiving longtime political allies, supporters, celebrities, military figures and others with personal ties to him and his administration.Jeffrey Crouch, an expert on executive clemency at American University, called it a “perfect storm” of highly unusual circumstances that “raise questions about favoritism and abuse of power that normally are not issues for presidential aspirants.”“It’s yet another wrinkle in an already very complicated legal and political landscape for Trump’s 2024 presidential bid,” Crouch, who wrote “The Presidential Pardon Power,” said.Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.As he seeks another four years in office, Trump is once again promising extraordinary use of his pardon powers. He has vowed to free those arrested in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol – potentially hundreds of people serving prison sentences – as he makes denialism of the bloody riots central to his campaign.Trump’s candidacy itself has also resurfaced debates over whether a president could pardon himself. The country may need to confront this question if the former president’s legal troubles remain unresolved before Election Day, as Trump faces 44 charges across two federal indictments. His pardon protections, though, would not extend to additional state charges he faces in separate indictments brought by prosecutors in Georgia and New York.Voting near his residence in Palm Beach on Tuesday, Trump contended he didn’t have any knowledge of Manafort’s potential role at his Milwaukee nominating convention, but he added: “He was another person who was treated badly and he was a patriot but we’ll see what happens with that.” The Washington Post first reported the discussions to get Manafort involved.Manafort, a lobbyist who became chairman of Trump’s first presidential campaign, was one of the highest-profile arrests in special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He was convicted in 2018 of defrauding banks and the government, and of failing to pay taxes on millions of dollars in income he had earned from Ukrainian political consulting. He later faced additional punishment for obstruction of justice.Originally sentenced to 7.5 years in prison in 2019, Manafort was granted home confinement in April 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. In December, a month after losing reelection, Trump pardoned Manafort.Trump issued 237 acts of clemency during his four-year term – the majority coming after the 2020 election, including 143 during his last hours in office. Though Trump issued fewer pardons than many of his modern predecessors, when he did, he largely operated outside the Office of the Pardon Attorney, a nonpartisan agency inside the Department of Justice that assess requests for executive clemency. The lack of protocols often led petitioners and their supporters to lobby Trump directly or make their case to his son-in-law Jared Kushner, chief of staff Mark Meadows or the White House counsel.Past presidents have certainly flexed their considerable clemency authority to benefit political allies and not without controversy. President Gerald Ford famously pardoned Richard Nixon a month after his predecessor resigned in disgrace. President George W. Bush commuted the sentence of Scooter Libby, the former chief of staff to his vice president Dick Cheney convicted of obstructing a federal investigation. President Bill Clinton issued a pardon for Marc Rich, who fled the country to avoid facing charges for tax evasion. Rich’s ex-wife was a donor to Clinton’s presidential library.But even against that history, Trump’s pardons stood out, Crouch said.“What is unusual is how many of Trump’s clemency grants went to well-known Republicans, military figures, and celebrities rather than average, unknown people,” he said.In the final months of his presidency, after losing the 2020 election to President Joe Biden, Trump frequently told his aides that he had planned to be liberal with his pardons and asked friends and loyalists who they thought he should pardon, multiple sources familiar with the conversations told CNN at the time. Trump, at the time, delighted in his ability to issue sweeping pardons – and viewed it as an opportunity to further build goodwill with those who had been loyal to him throughout his time in office.Other stalwart Trump allies beside Manafort to receive a pardon included: veteran Republican operative Roger Stone, who was also indicted by Mueller and convicted of multiple crimes; Bannon, who had pleaded not guilty to charges he defrauded donors in a “We Build the Wall” online fundraising campaign; and Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser charged with lying to the FBI.Without Trump’s intervention, it’s possible all four could have spent the 2024 election cycle serving federal punishments. Stone in 2020 was sentenced to three years in prison and two years of supervised release. Trump pardoned Bannon before he went to trial, but his three co-defendants last year received prison sentences ranging from three to five years. Flynn pleaded guilty but was never sentenced and faced a maximum of five years in prison.Instead, they’re now key players in the effort to reelect Trump, emerging as some of his most ardent defenders to their sizable audiences. Stone remains an outspoken supporter of his longtime friend, trafficking in unsavory rumors about Trump’s political opponents on social media and hosting a radio show on a conservative New York station that debuted with a Trump appearance. He is also a regular at Mar-a-Lago and walked out with Trump’s campaign staff on Super Tuesday for the former president’s victory speech.Bannon’s War Room podcast serves as a clarion call to Trump supporters to mobilize around the 2024 election by regularly spreading misinformation about the last one. Flynn has toured the country in recent years, appearing at rallies where he, too, shares election conspiracies. Calling into one of the events last year, Trump told Flynn: “We’re going to bring you back.”Dinesh D’Souza, one of Trump’s earlier pardons, has championed the former president’s causes as well through his own podcast and other media ventures. Most notably, D’Souza – who in 2014 pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign contributions – created “2000 Mules,” a misleadingly edited and conspiratorial film about the 2020 election that has animated Trump’s opposition to voting by mail. Trump hosted a screening of the film at Mar-a-Lago in 2022.And then there’s disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a former contestant of Trump’s Celebrity Apprentice reality television show who was freed by the former president in early 2020. Blagojevich recently defended Trump’s courtroom antics in an interview with Politico, calling the former president “brave” while lauding his “chutzpah.”Many pardoned by Trump had long ago served their time and are now aiding Trump from the other side of their amnesty. Tate was convicted in 2014 along with two other senior leaders on Ron Paul’s 2012 presidential campaign on charges stemming from a bribery plot to secure an Iowa state senator’s endorsement. His sentence, issued in 2016, included six months of home confinement, two years of probation and community service.CNN reached out to Tate through an email address on the website of his consulting firm, but he did not respond.Trump also effectively cleared the name of Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law who in the mid-2000s served prison time after he pleaded guilty to 16 counts of tax evasion, one count of retaliating against a federal witness – his brother-in-law – and another count of lying to the Federal Election Commission.Last June, Kushner gave $1 million to Make America Great Again, Inc., one of the largest single contributions to the pro-Trump super PAC so far. Meanwhile, Trump-pardoned New York real estate executive Alex Adjmi donated $100,000 to MAGA Inc., as did the son and daughter-in-law of Paul Pogue, a former construction executive from Texas included in Trump’s last-minute pardons. Pogue and his wife also contributed $6,600 to a Trump-affiliated campaign committee.Already, there is intrigue around the fate of another Trump ally, Peter Navarro. An ex-White House aide for Trump, Navarro recently reported to federal prison after he refused to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6 attack.Trump on Tuesday wouldn’t say if he intends to pardon Navarro if he returns to the White House. But his praise for his former aide echoed words he used to describe Manafort.“Good man. He was treated very unfairly,” Trump said. “A great patriot.”"

        "title": "Why a no-drama government shutdown would be NBD",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Add $1.2 trillion in government spending bills to the short list of things where it’s fine to barely miss – horseshoes, hand grenades and taxpayer dollars.The multi-act, epic saga of funding the government for the fiscal year that is nearly halfway over is finally at its end, but maybe not before funding lapses for much of the government after 11:59 p.m. ET Friday.It’s not exactly a shutdown if lawmakers can pass the package close to on time, before the end of the weekend. Internal Revenue Service workers won’t be furloughed during tax season and border agents won’t be working without pay.The asterisk of a temporary lapse in funding would be the drama-free result of parliamentary procedure rather than a pitched policy standoff – assuming everything goes according to plan.Here’s what to know:All indications are that the final departments of the federal government will get full-year funding in short order. It might not happen until over the weekend or early next week, however, which is after funding lapses.Maybe. But not exactly. The temporary lapse in funding over the weekend for parts of the government would be so short that it would likely have a very limited impact on government operations.Republicans in the House have made a very big deal about publishing text of bills a full 72 hours before they get final votes.The 1,000-plus pages of text for this bill was put online just before 3 a.m. Thursday morning. If lawmakers were given 72 hours to read it, they would not be able to vote until 3 a.m. Sunday.Instead, it appears House Speaker Mike Johnson will get help from Democrats to waive that 72-hour rule and vote on the bill Friday in the House.The Senate would then need to get past its own procedural hurdles. Assuming no senator decides to really slow things down, they could vote over the weekend.Asked on CNBC Thursday if he would waive the 72-hour requirement, Johnson said he supports the principle and wants members to read bills before they vote on them. They should be reading this bill now, he said, suggesting they might not get the full three days.“I think we have to get this done by the weekend, because I think the stakes are too high,” Johnson said.Short-term, no-big-deal government funding lapses like this possible one are not unprecedented.In 1982, for instance, lawmakers had a deal in place to fund the government, but they ran out of time to pass the funding bills. Republicans were set to attend a barbecue at the White House. Tammy Wynette sang “Stand By Your Man,” as then-President Ronald Reagan looked on. Democrats were bound for a fundraiser.Funding lapsed, but they went back to work the next day. Granted, that was at the end of September, when the fiscal year ends. This year, a potential temporary lapse for part of the government will occur almost six months late, when the fiscal year to be funded is already nearly halfway over.A Congressional Research Service review of previous funding lapses since the concept was created in 1980 notes that brief lapses – those lasting less than three days – often do not result in much of anything shutting down, particularly when there is an expectation that the appropriations bills are coming.Republicans took control of the House in January 2023, but this is the first set of spending bills on which their majority could make a mark.But neither the House nor the Senate passed their 12 appropriations bills on time. Instead, they agreed to a short-term extension back in September. The right wing of the party was frustrated that then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy couldn’t win more concessions from Democrats who control the Senate.The hard-liners in the GOP ousted McCarthy from the top spot in the House, and it took three weeks for Republicans to settle on Johnson as McCarthy’s replacement.Johnson then pushed a series of three more temporary funding bills while negotiations for the full-year funding proceeded. Last-minute standoffs over border spending delayed the final product to Thursday.Six departments of the federal government are included. They are Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch. The other six departments were funded with a bill that passed earlier in March.That was Johnson’s idea. Shortly after he took over as speaker, he proposed this bifurcated process as a way to take some pressure out of the process.Not like this. Appropriations committees in the House and Senate are supposed to work out bills for various federal departments. Those should be considered separately, and then House and Senate versions should be reconciled.It’s only happened that way a handful of times in the decades since the process was adopted. Instead, the committees work out their versions of the bill and then they are cobbled into larger bills by House and Senate leaders.Republican leaders are proclaiming some victories, including cuts to diversity programs at the Pentagon and cuts in IRS enforcement, among other things. The deal boosts defense spending with pay hikes for service members but keeps most other spending in line with current levels.“We got some of the things we wanted. We didn’t get everything we wanted,” Johnson said on CNBC, noting his current two-seat House majority doesn’t allow him to get more in terms of government spending cuts.But it will take some time for lawmakers, reporters and watchdogs to read the fine print. Here’s what CNN’s report says about the broad outlines:The package provides $19.6 billion for Customs and Border Protection, a $3.2 billion increase above fiscal year 2023, and includes $495 million for additional Border Patrol agents, which the Biden administration has repeatedly called for. It does not add funding for the border wall.The package also provides almost $90 billion in discretionary funding to the Department of Homeland Security, bolstering funding for additional resources. It funds 41,500 detention beds, which is more than the previous fiscal year and Biden’s request, according to the GOP summary. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement had recently drafted plans to wind down detention space, and as a result, release migrants, to cover their budget shortfall.The bill also increases Department of Defense funding, providing $824.3 billion, an increase of $26.8 billion above fiscal year 2023.It also provides an additional 12,000 special immigrant visas for Afghans who helped the US.Read a more in-depth look at what’s in the bill from CNN’s Tami Luhby and Katie Lobosco.This is not the outcome predicted by many pundits when earlier acts of this same funding process saw the right wing of the Republican Party reject a House speaker in large part for working with Democrats to keep the government open.Instead, the conservative replacement, Johnson, has carried on largely in the footsteps of McCarthy, who has departed from Congress.If the package passes, the government will be funded for the rest of this year because Johnson agreed to pass yearlong funding bills with help from Democrats. While the right-wing Republicans who ousted McCarthy are fuming, they are also not yet organizing an effort to oust Johnson.Short-term funding lapse or not, this is something approaching governing."

        "title": "Trump’s vice presidential shortlist is very long — and in flux",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "At a fundraiser in New York, Donald Trump asked donors what they thought of Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake ﻿as a running mate.In recent conversations, the former president has appeared fixated on Ohio Sen. JD Vance.And Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, former Trump Cabinet official Ben Carson and even former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley are among some of the names on a lengthy list Trump has mentioned over the past several months.The presumptive GOP nominee is floating them all as he weighs who the next potential vice president will be.Trump routinely asks allies, donors and Mar-a-Lago members for their take. Sources said his interest in potential candidates is frequently changing and is often based on recent conversations with various allies.“One day he is trashing someone, and the next day he is asking allies about that person as vice president. Sometimes he’s just curious what people think of them,” one Trump adviser told CNN.In recent weeks, Trump has expressed increased interest in Rubio, Vance, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the matter or have spoken to the former president about it.Trump advisers have indicated that the former president is nowhere near to making a formal decision on whom he wants to run with, the sources said. Trump has also not personally discussed the role with many of the names he has floated, according to conversations with people close to the potential candidates.While Trump volleys names and potential candidates begin jockeying behind the scenes, his campaign has compiled a list of more than a dozen potential vice presidential picks to be vetted, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.One source described the list as “unsurprising,” indicating that it was composed of a number of names that had already been out in the public space, many of which Trump himself had floated. While the campaign is tracking names, multiple sources cautioned that the former president would ultimately make the decision on whom he would share the ticket with whether they were vetted or not.Trump has indicated privately that he will announce a vice presidential pick in the early summer before the Republican convention, three sources told CNN.Trump and those in his inner circle had at one point considered an announcement of his running mate shortly after he had secured enough delegates to win the GOP presidential nomination, and advisers say that Trump may yet decide on an earlier announcement.Trump allies argue that there are pros and cons to each timeline. An early announcement would mean being able to potentially fundraise off that selection — especially helpful as his team struggles to compete financially with President Joe Biden’s campaign.Announcing later, though, can create suspense and increase attention around the former president as Republicans jockey to serve as his second-in-command.Recently, Trump has told allies that it does not matter whom he picks as his running mate, indicating that it is him alone who will carry the 2024 Republican ticket, multiple sources told CNN.“Trump knows that people who are going to vote for him are going to vote for him, and those who aren’t are not going to change their mind because of a running mate,” one source close to the former president told CNN.However, sources noted Trump’s political savvy and said he would looking for a running mate’s potential to help him with specific voting blocs with whom he is more vulnerable.Some close to the former president were most surprised by how seriously Trump is considering Rubio, the Florida senator who clashed heavily with him during the 2016 GOP presidential primary.After announcing his third presidential bid, Trump privately expressed anger toward Rubio for not endorsing him early on, often pointing out to advisers that he had held an event for the senator in Miami ahead of his last election. Rubio endorsed Trump earlier this year.However, Trump’s consideration of Rubio is “very much real,” as one source with direct knowledge of the discussions told CNN.“He likes Rubio because he’s Hispanic, young, a good speaker, natural charisma,” a senior Trump adviser said.The former president recently went as far as to acknowledge there would be a delegate issue with selecting Rubio because the two are both residents of Florida, a second source briefed on the matter said, something some of Trump’s senior advisers also pointed out.There is no law preventing a president and vice president of the US being from the same state. However, Article II of the Constitution prevents electors in each state from voting for two people from the same state.The rule would be even more relevant in a close election, and the Trump campaign currently predicts that the 2024 race will be close, according to conversations with multiple Trump advisers.Responding to reports about his name being floated, Rubio told conservative radio host Glenn Beck that “anybody who gets a chance to serve as vice president of the United States should consider that an honor.”The senator added: “I have never spoken either to President Trump or anybody on his campaign about this or anybody else that they’re considering for vice president.”Multiple allies have attempted to pitch Trump on South Carolina’s Scott, who is believed to be under consideration. However, one source who discussed Scott with Trump said he seemed uninterested during their conversation. Others close to the former president disagreed with this read and noted that Trump has been incredibly impressed by Scott as a surrogate after the senator suspended his own 2024 presidential campaign.Outside of a potential vice president, there will be hundreds of administration jobs to fill if Trump is elected, and Trump-aligned organizations are hard at work vetting applicants to build out potential staff. It is expected that Trump’s team will draw heavily from a database of loyalist applicants being compiled by Project 2025, a transition effort run by the conservative Heritage Foundation. One of Trump’s most trusted former aides, John McEntee, is consulting on the personnel part of the project.This story has been updated."

        "text": "Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday that it would have been “absurd” for someone in his position to edit or redact a special counsel’s final report.In response to a question about whether former special counsel Robert Hur’s characterization of President Joe Biden was inappropriate in his final report, Garland said it was his obligation to release a full and unedited report.“The idea that an attorney general would edit or redact or censor the special counsel’s explanation for why the special counsel reached the decision that the special counsel did – that’s absurd,” Garland said during a news conference at the Justice Department to announce an antitrust lawsuit against Apple.While the facts of Hur’s report and the overall process of his investigation into whether Biden mishandled classified information haven’t been challenged, Hur has been criticized by allies of the president over whether his final report went too far by publicly criticizing’s Biden memory or selectively including excerpts of a deposition with the president.Hur did not recommend charges against the president but his report led to plenty of consternation among Democrats about Hur’s description of Biden as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”"

        "title": "GOP-led House panel sues Hunter Biden tax prosecutors in standoff with Justice Department over testimony",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The House Judiciary Committee is suing two Justice Department tax prosecutors involved in the Hunter Biden criminal investigation whom Republicans have been trying to interview for months, ratcheting up a separation of powers fight between Congress and the Biden administration that is now spilling into court.The Republican-led committee filed the lawsuit in Washington, DC’s federal court against federal tax prosecutors Mark Daly and Jack Morgan. The committee has been demanding the men testify as part of its impeachment inquiry around the Biden family since September.The complaint asked the court on Thursday to step in immediately with an emergency order that would force Morgan and Daly to testify. That outcome is unlikely, however, as lawsuits like these typically are part of political tactics in standoffs between Congress and the executive branch when they are controlled by opposing political parties.Republicans have wanted to talk to these two officials as part of their probe into the DOJ’s handling of the criminal case of the president’s son, specifically wanting to ask Morgan and Daly about meetings and conversations among federal investigators and about the Departments’ protracted decision-making before charging Hunter Biden for tax avoidance. Republicans zeroed in on these two career prosecutors after IRS whistleblowers alleged that Daly and Morgan were supportive of charging the president’s son for tax crimes then changed their recommendations.An attorney for Daly declined to comment about the lawsuit, and an attorney for Morgan didn’t immediately respond to a request from CNN on Thursday. The Justice Department is likely to represent the two DOJ officials in court to oppose the lawsuit.Federal District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee, is assigned to handle the lawsuit, according to court records.The Department of Justice has so far repeatedly told the House the DOJ wouldn’t allow these employees to testify about their official work, and that the subpoenas were invalid, according to letters with the committee released as part of the lawsuit. The House had said Justice Department lawyers couldn’t sit in on the depositions of the DOJ prosecutors — a rule the Justice Department took particular issue with.​“They defied the Subpoenas because they elected to comply with DOJ’s baseless and unlawful direction not to appear,” lawyers for the House wrote in the lawsuit Thursday. “Regardless of what information Daly and Morgan will disclose, or who may accompany them, they still must appear.”The Justice Department has refused to make Daly and Morgan available for depositions, instead allowing more senior officials overseeing the Hunter Biden criminal investigation to testify. The Department also objected to the career prosecutors testifying because of taxpayer privacy, secrecy protections around criminal investigations and constitutional concerns related to the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch, according to letters made public in the House lawsuit.“The constitutional and statutory questions raised by the competing claims of the executive and legislative branches of government in instances like this are thorny, complex, and in many instances unresolved by the third branch of government—the courts,” Daly’s attorney Robert Driscoll wrote in one letter to the committee last fall. “I urge a negotiated resolution between the committee and DOJ … It is not up to Mr. Daly.”A lawyer for Morgan, Catherine Duval, also told the committee Morgan would be “following his employer’s directive,” according to the court records.A Justice Department spokesperson defended the decision to block Morgan and Daly from testifying, telling CNN Thursday that it will “continue to protect our line personnel and the integrity of their work” and respond to the filings in court.“The Department is committed to working with Congress in good faith,” the spokesperson said. “It is unfortunate that despite this extraordinary cooperation from senior DOJ officials, the Committee has decided, after waiting for months, to continue seeking to depose line prosecutors about sensitive information from ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions.”This is the second time the Republican-led House in the current Congress has gone to court in an attempt to enforce subpoenas of witnesses.Earlier this year, the Judiciary Committee sued for an FBI agent’s testimony in an investigation of the Biden administration over its approach to tech companies and online speech. That lawsuit is still in its earliest stage.The cases follow in the footsteps of a major court fight over House testimony from the former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn as part of the Russia investigation. The case generated many headlines for years and several judicial opinions. But it ended in a whimper with McGahn agreeing to testify years later, after Trump left the presidency.Historically, Congressional subpoena lawsuits end unsuccessfully when a court is asked to intervene – and instead typically end with a negotiated agreement between the executive branch and Congress.The McGahn subpoena standoff came closest among any lawsuit to getting the courts to define Congress’ subpoena power. But there isn’t binding law from the federal judiciary on whether the House has given itself the ability to sue to enforce its subpoenas.This story has been updated with additional details."

        "text": "Pro-Trump lawyer Stefanie Lambert surrendered Thursday to Michigan authorities in connection with her 2020 election tampering indictment, after a wild week where she was labeled a fugitive and spent a night in jail after being arrested in Washington, DC.The special prosecutor who charged Lambert in Michigan, DJ Hilson, confirmed that she turned herself in Thursday morning and appeared in Oakland County Circuit Court.“The judge ruled that the Michigan bench warrant is now set aside, and she was taken into custody for the sole purpose of collecting her DNA and fingerprints,” Hilson said.Lambert’s attorney, Daniel Hartman, also confirmed that she surrendered, as she pledged to do after being released by a local DC judge earlier this week. Hartman said Lambert’s fingerprints will not be entered into the system “until further order of the court.” Lambert has been fighting an effort by prosecutors to take her fingerprints.The surrender came days after Lambert’s arrest at the federal courthouse in DC. She was taken into custody Monday by US marshals immediately after she participated in a two-hour hearing in Dominion Voting Systems’ defamation case against her client, ex-Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, regarding his false claims about the 2020 election.That hearing in the DC-based defamation case was about Lambert’s recent leak of internal Dominion emails, which she obtained through her representation of Byrne. But Lambert’s DC arrest, and her surrender in Michigan on Thursday, were due to a warrant that was issued after she failed to appear at recent hearings in her criminal case.She was indicted last year in connection with an attempted election system breach in Michigan, which was one of several incidents in battleground states where Donald Trump supporters tried to prove their voter-fraud theories after he lost the 2020 election."

        "title": "Netanyahu’s response to Schumer widens rift in US-Israeli relations",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is refusing to bow to calls by the top US senator for a new election and is pushing back against White House warnings about a potential new offensive in Gaza, widening a rift with top Democrats in Washington.An extraordinary turn in US-Israel relations in recent days is coinciding with intense diplomacy aimed at securing a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas and the release of hostages as the conflict deepens bitter divides in US politics. But the gulf in trust and goals between Israel and Hamas has thwarted hopes for a breakthrough for weeks.Netanyahu’s defiance shone through an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday, three days after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer – the highest-ranking Jewish American in the US government – said that a new Israeli government was needed to reset war strategy and that Netanyahu was an obstacle to peace.“It’s inappropriate to go to a sister democracy and try to replace the elected leadership there. That’s something that Israel, the Israeli public does on its own, and we’re not a banana republic,” Netanyahu said on “State of the Union.”“The majority of Israelis support the policies of my government. It’s not a fringe government. It represents the policies supported by the majority of the people. If Sen. Schumer opposes these policies, he’s not opposing me. He’s opposing the people of Israel,” Netanyahu said.Despite the Israeli prime minister’s stand, there is increasing criticism of his approach in the US and overseas, at a time when his position among some Israeli voters is fragile, five months after terror attacks that besmirched his brand as the country’s ultimate security guarantor. Thousands of protesters filled the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem Saturday night, in two separate groups, one calling for the government to resign and others demanding the release of the hostages in Gaza.Despite a fearsome onslaught in Gaza, Hamas is far from defeated. Scores of Israeli hostages remain missing or unaccounted for. The huge death toll among Palestinians has hardened much of the outside world against Israel’s actions and squandered early sympathy after the October 7 terror attacks. And there is no clear plan for how to rebuild or administer Gaza – site of a humanitarian nightmare – after any eventual Hamas defeat.The heated rhetoric flying between Washington and Jerusalem raises fundamental questions about the future of the US-Israeli relationship. It also underscores the hyper-politicization of Israeli policy in Washington as Republicans line up to castigate Schumer and accuse Democratic leaders of snubbing an ally in wartime. The tensions are even more acute since some senior Democrats wonder whether Netanyahu is keen to keep the war going to postpone an election that could oust him. President Joe Biden’s support for Israel’s right to defend itself, meanwhile, threatens his own coalition ahead of his reelection bid in November, with progressive and younger voters upset over his handling of the war. Biden and Netanyahu therefore are being driven further apart by their own competing political imperatives.Latest developments also raise the question of whether Schumer’s stinging criticism augurs a shift to more pressure on Netanyahu from Biden. The president embraced Israel after the Hamas terror attacks that killed 1,200 people but has become more critical of Israeli policy in a war in which more than 31,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza health ministry. Amid shockwaves from Schumer’s remarks Thursday, Biden complimented the New York Democrat’s speech and said many Americans agreed with it. But he is yet to strike a similar tone.For all his evident frustration, the president has not taken tangible steps to apply US leverage against Netanyahu, who has repeatedly appeared to ignore US advice or calls for a ratcheting down of the war to spare civilians. Biden has moved to open new aid routes into Gaza with air drops and a temporary port link. But he has not conditioned the use of US-made and provided weapons to Israel. And the president, despite forging his own popularity in Israel with his initial reaction to the attacks and trip to the Jewish state in wartime, has not sought to appeal to Israelis over the head of Netanyahu. The Israeli leader has sometimes done as much in his own frequent interventions into US domestic politics.White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that Biden and Netanyahu don’t agree on everything in the war, before adding: “But that’s the government that is in place, and that’s the government, the war cabinet, that we’re going to continue to work with.”One of the glaring areas of disagreement is the proposed Israeli offensive in Rafah in southern Gaza, which Biden previously warned would cross a US “red line” – though his remarks were somewhat ambiguous. There is no doubt, however, that the White House is skeptical of the plan because of the potential toll on civilians in Gaza, where humanitarian conditions are worsening. Speaking on CNN, Netanyahu doubled down on his intention to invade Rafah, vowing to “destroy the remaining Hamas terrorist battalions.”But on ABC, Kirby said, “We would not support such an operation unless or until they’ve got a credible executable plan to take care of the 1.5 million refugees that have been pushed into Rafah.”As the reverberations continue from Schumer’s remarks on Thursday, there is renewed focus on diplomacy aimed at a temporary ceasefire in Gaza to allow the surging of humanitarian supplies to the devastated enclave and for the release of some of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas.Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told Al-Arabiya on Sunday that the group, which rules Gaza, had presented a “logical” proposal that could bring a breakthrough in the negotiations but accused Israel of wanting to prolong the war. Netanyahu told CNN on Sunday that Israel is seeking a deal that would see the release of 100 hostages in exchange for a six-week pause in fighting. But his criticism of Hamas underscored the fragility of hopes for a breakthrough. “Hamas’ outlandish demands … makes that deal a lot more difficult, but we’re going to keep on trying because we want those hostages back,” the Israeli leader told CNN.The increasing distrust between the Israeli government and top Democrats in Washington can be seen in their different opinions of how the war should be waged. But it also reflects long-term political shifts in both countries.Through his years in power, Netanyahu has moved sharply to the right, and his current coalition is the most conservative in Israeli history, relying on several small ultra-orthodox parties. In the United States, meanwhile, the Republican Party has undergone a similar transformation, and there is now considerable ideological synergy between the GOP and Netanyahu’s Likud.Netanyahu has also noticeably courted Republican leaders and irked Democratic ones. For instance, he lectured President Barack Obama in the Oval Office about the situation in the Middle East in front of journalists in 2011 in a way that infuriated White House staff. He traveled to Washington at the invitation of Republicans in 2015 to try to shatter an Iran nuclear deal during an address to Congress. He also aligned himself with ex-President Donald Trump – and got multiple policy wins as a result – including the relocation of the US Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.Given this background, and the feverish political climate in an election year in the United States, it’s not surprising Republicans are trying to seize on the rift between Democrats and Israel to their own electoral advantage – and Democrats see politics at play.Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said on “State of the Union” that the message from Netanyahu was: “‘Let us run our own country. We appreciate you as our close allies, but we’re going to make up our own minds, and we will do it according to our laws and our customs.’” House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul said on Fox, “There’s a way to talk about your differences – not to topple a democratic country.” The Texas Republican said there was a “split in the Democratic Party” between what he called a “pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel faction” and those who support Israel.Events of recent days are so remarkable since Biden and Schumer are among the most pro-Israel politicians in modern American history. But the deeply felt ties of both men toward Israel may, to some extent, reflect nostalgia for a more moderate political time in the Jewish state that is a far cry from Netanyahu’s radicalism. Even a year ago it would be impossible to believe that the Senate majority leader would call for a new election in Israel. His remarks last week speak to the extreme political pressure Democratic leaders have been under from other senior members of the party, not to mention their voters. Schumer’s remarks are beginning to look like a milestone in US-Israeli relations since it suggests that senior Democrats no longer believe that lock-step support for Israel involves acquiescing to every policy of a hard-right governing coalition.Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi – another longtime friend of Israel – offered staunch support to Schumer on Sunday and sought to explain the speech. “He loves Israel, as we do. We support Israel. And the fact that he made this statement should be listened to, because Israel’s reputation is at risk because of what is happening in Gaza,” the California Democrat said on “State of the Union,” alluding to looming famine in Gaza over which the World Health Organization expressed grave concern on Sunday.“Chuck Schumer’s speech was an act of courage, an act of love for Israel. And I wish the prime minister would read the whole speech, because he speaks with great vehemence about the need to defeat Hamas,” Pelosi said. “He is concerned about the weakness of the Palestinian Authority and the very, very dangerous attitude of the right-wing Israeli government.”"

        "text": "Former New York Rep. George Santos announced Friday that he was leaving the Republican Party and would continue his congressional comeback bid as an independent.Santos, who faces a slew of federal charges and was expelled from the House last year, attacked the GOP in a social media post and pledged to take “Ultra MAGA/Trump supporting values to the ballot in November as an Independent.”“I in good conscience cannot affiliate myself with a party that stands for nothing and falls for everything,” he wrote on X. “I am officially suspending my petitioning in #NY01 to access the ballot as a Republican and will be filling to run as an independent.”Santos previously represented New York’s 3rd Congressional District on Long Island. Earlier this month, during President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address, the former congressman announced he would challenge Republican Rep. Nick LaLota in the neighboring 1st District. LaLota introduced a resolution to expel him last fall.LaLota, an outspoken critic of Santos, responded to the challenge by touting his effort to kick out his former colleague and “hold a pathological liar who stole an election accountable.”“If finishing the job requires beating him in a primary, count me in,” LaLota said on March 7.Santos has pleaded not guilty to 23 federal charges, including allegations of fraud related to Covid-19 unemployment benefits, misusing campaign funds and lying about his personal finances on House disclosure reports.For Santos to run as an independent in November, he’ll need to file an independent nominating petition with the signatures of 3,500 voters in New York’s 1st District to the Suffolk County Board of Elections by May 28."

        "title": "Legal consequences are harsh and painful when they finally arrive in Trump’s orbit",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Donald Trump is a master at postponing legal accountability, but two cases targeting the ex-president and his orbit now in the penalty phase show that when the law finally exacts its price, the experience can be harsh and humiliating.Trump’s lawyers said Monday that he cannot secure a bond to cover a near half billion dollar judgment against him in a New York fraud case while he appeals. The admission is a dent to the mystique of an ex-president who built his brand on the power and size of his “The Art of the Deal” fortune. And it raises the possibility his cash crunch could worsen a growing personal and campaign financial crisis.And Peter Navarro, Trump’s former trade guru, is headed to prison after failing in his plea for the Supreme Court to spare him jail while he appeals a conviction for ignoring congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony about his boss’ bid to overturn the 2020 election.Both cases offer a lesson in the potential consequences of the culture of rule-breaking and a sense that pervades Trump world that the law is something that applies to other people. They also show that while defiance of laws and customs can be a potent political tool for the ex-president and his advisors, the outcomes of prosecutions designed to enforce more stringent codes of behavior can impose painful legal consequences regardless of politics. In Navarro’s case, his plight as a 74-year-old who is readying himself for the scary prospect of prison highlights the sometime price of loyalty to Trump and the ex-president’s method of turning every legal challenge into a political cause to boost his brand and goals.Dramas over Trump’s latest legal struggles and his former advisor’s fight to stay out of jail again show how the former president and his associates use every single avenue of potential appeal — protections guaranteed to them by the Constitution and legal system Trump often decries — to postpone legal outcomes. This tactic has helped Trump get closer to one 2024 goal as his frenetic litigation has succeeded in delaying his criminal legal trials to the extent that it’s not certain that he will go before a jury before November’s presidential election. But for all the delays and digressions, the law, in the end, can be relentless. And while it has become a new normal to see a presumptive presidential nominee constantly embroiled in courtroom dramas, another set of legal imbroglios surrounding Trump and a high-profile member of the Make America Great Again movement is also a reminder of the surreal circumstances of the 2024 election.Trump has been trying to find an insurance company to underwrite his bond for at least $464 million dollars plus interest pending the appeals process after he, his adult sons and the Trump Organization were found liable for huge sums in ill-gotten gains in a civil fraud trial brought by the state of New York. Multiple insurance firms have balked at Trump’s attempt to finance the bond based on the value of his real estate assets. His tactics appear to indicate he lacks sufficient cash or shares to guarantee the agreement to cover disgorgement payments and interest payments on his own. The payment is required since an appeal could drag on for years and the state wants certainty that it will be paid if the court rules in its favor.The former president argues that the value of his properties, including skyscrapers and golf resorts, vastly exceeds the size of the bond and therefore the court should allow him to defray payment until after the appeals process. This argument is richly ironic since it follows a case in which Trump was accused of hyping the value of his buildings to gain preferential rates from banks and insurance firms.“This is somebody who is in this unenviable position because he has been found guilty of over inflating the values of his properties, so it makes sense insurance companies would not accept the properties and his valuations of them as security on a bond of this size,” former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. Judge Arthur Engoron ruled last month that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records.Post-trial action in this case also hints at the darkening reality of Trump’s position and the way in which his fortune and empire appears to be in grave peril from the case. As CNN’s Allison Morrow noted, if Trump doesn’t put up the immense amount of money he needs, the judgment can be enforced, allowing New York Attorney General Letitia James to seize Trump’s properties and sell them to pay down what he owes.As James put it in an interview with ABC News last month: “Yes, I look at 40 Wall Street each and every day,” referring to one of the ex-president’s most cherished Manhattan properties.In another irony, there are increasing signs that for all his strength in polls, Trump has money problems. He’s already had to post bond of more than $90 million pending an appeal after he lost a second defamation case to the writer E. Jean Carroll. And his multiple cases, including four looming criminal trials, have saddled him with huge legal bills. The use of some of the cash from his political fundraising committees to meet those costs threatens to worsen an emerging cash disadvantage to President Joe Biden and the Democrats in the run-up to November.As always with Trump, there is a legal front and a political one. It does not seem likely that signs he’s not as rich as he claims could undermine his business legend, which many supporters at his rallies still cite as qualification for the Oval Office. Nothing has weakened the ex-president among the hardest core of his support, and his effort to portray the multiple criminal and civil prosecutions that he’s facing as examples of political persecution have been a great success, helping him dominate the GOP primary race by consolidating base voters around his narrative. Trump argues that he’s protecting millions of Americans who would otherwise face victimization from the government. His claims are inaccurate but appear to be politically effective among his supporters who revile political and legal elites in Washington. Recently, he’s even drawn analogies between his legal situation and unfair treatment of minorities by the criminal justice system as he seeks to drive down Biden’s support among Black voters who form a critical part of the Democratic coalition in swing states.Given the sensitivities of an election year, an attempt by James, who Trump has already complained is biased against him, to seize his properties would cause an extraordinary political furor. The process of seizing assets is legally complex at the best of times. It would likely be even more so given the labyrinthine financing used by Trump in his business. And the former president would certainly highlight his treatment to super charge his claims he’s a victim of a political witch hunt to keep him out of the White House. Therefore, there are good reasons why James – a Democrat –may seek other legal remedies to secure the judgment.Trump is already trying to weaponize his latest legal liabilities. The presumptive Republican nominee said on Truth Social that a bond of this size is “unConstitutional, un-American, unprecedented, and practically impossible for ANY Company, including one as successful as mine.” “We will fight and defeat this Hoax, and all of the other Crooked Joe-directed Hoaxes, once and for all. If I wasn’t running for President of the United States, and leading by a lot, this kind of Witch Hunt would never have happened,” Trump said, seeking to highlight a question that has long surrounded this case – whether another businessman would have had the same treatment if he lacked the ex-president’s profile.Trump does have some other options – for example, he could refinance or sell some of his diverse portfolio to put up the money. In court papers Monday, Trump’s lawyers accused James of being inflexible and argued that posting a full bond for a judgment of this size was a “practical impossibility.” They also warned that if he was forced to divest his properties, Trump would become victim to a “fire sale” that would cause massive losses. The ex-president says the court has the authority to stay the judgment until after the appeal plays out.While Trump was fighting on multiple fronts, Navarro Monday was contemplating the nightmare of jail time as soon as Tuesday after Chief Justice John Roberts rejected his last-ditch effort to stay free.Navarro had argued that a federal judge’s refusal to let him raise an executive privilege defense at trial was wrong and that since an appeals court could reverse the decision he should remain out of prison. But Roberts wrote in a brief order that he had no basis to disagree with the lower court finding that Navarro had forfeited any argument that he could avoid appearing before Congress even if he was entitled to the privilege.Navarro is expected to report to the minimum-security federal Bureau of Prisons satellite camp in Miami and become the first former White House official ever jailed for contempt of Congress. “He’s nervous,” Navarro’s prison consultant Sam Mangel told CNN. “Anybody, regardless of the length of their sentence, is going into an unknown world.” Navarro was sentenced to around four months in prison but is expected to be eligible for early release.Although his case is historic, Navarro is far from the only ex-Trump associate to serve time in jail. For one of the most famous, there is apparently the possibility of an unlikely comeback.Trump’s team is considering bringing back his former 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort to help with the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this summer, CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported. The possibility of his return was first reported by the Washington Post.Manafort was released from jail to home confinement during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 after serving about a third of a 7.5 year term. He was convicted of financial crimes in a case arising from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe and was eventually pardoned by Trump.Meanwhile, legal controversies continue to swirl around a host of lesser-known Trump operatives due to the former president’s reckless behavior. In a Michigan-related case, Stefanie Lambert, a pro-Trump lawyer who tried to overturn the 2020 election, was arrested in a dramatic courtroom scene on Monday following a court hearing about her recent leak of internal emails belonging to Dominion Voting Systems.This story has been updated with additional details."

        "title": "GOP nominee to run North Carolina public schools called for violence against Democrats, including executing Obama and Biden",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The Republican nominee for superintendent overseeing North Carolina’s public schools and its $11 billion budget has a history marked by extreme and controversial comments, including sharing baseless conspiracy theories and frequent calls for the execution of prominent Democrats.Michele Morrow, a conservative activist who last week upset the incumbent Superintendent of Public Instruction in North Carolina’s Republican primary, expressed support in 2020 for the televised execution of former President Barack Obama and suggested killing then-President-elect Joe Biden.In other comments on social media between 2019 and 2021 reviewed by CNN’s KFile, Morrow made disturbing suggestions about executing prominent Democrats for treason, including Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Hillary Clinton, Sen. Chuck Schumer and other prominent people such as Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates.“I prefer a Pay Per View of him in front of the firing squad,” she wrote in a tweet from May 2020, responding to a user sharing a conspiracy theory who suggested sending Obama to prison at Guantanamo Bay. “I do not want to waste another dime on supporting his life. We could make some money back from televising his death.”In another post in May 2020, she responded to a fake Time Magazine cover that featured art of Obama in an electric chair asking if he should be executed.“Death to ALL traitors!!” Morrow responded.In yet another comment, Morrow suggested in December 2020 killing Biden, who at that time was president-elect, and has said he would ask Americans to wear a mask for 100 days.“Never. We need to follow the Constitution’s advice and KILL all TRAITORS!!! #JusticeforAmerica,” she wrote.CNN reached out to Morrow and her campaign multiple times but did not receive a response. Following publication of this story, Morrow defended her previous tweets, claiming Obama committed treason.Last Tuesday, Morrow defeated Catherine Truitt, the incumbent North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction, in the Republican primary. Morrow, a registered nurse and grassroots activist who homeschooled her children, ran on a platform of supporting parental rights and opposing critical race theory.As superintendent, Morrow would oversee the state’s public school system and help set educational priorities, manage the school system’s budgets, and work with the state’s Board of Education to set and implement curriculum standards. Her website lists endorsements by “conservative school boards” but remains light on changes she’d make if elected.Morrow has in the past called public schools “socialism centers” and “indoctrination centers.”In a campaign speech in February, Morrow advocated for a constitutional amendment to abolish the state Board of Education, which sets policies and procedures for public schools in the state. Doing away with the board would put direct control over the state’s education agenda under the superintendent and the state legislature, which is currently controlled by Republicans.“I’d like to see a constitutional amendment to get rid of the state Board of Education,”she said. “If the superintendent is elected and works under the legislature - knowing that they’re accountable to the legislature to oversee the DPI and to oversee and have impact into the superintendents in the 115 districts, I think we would be so much better off because you don’t have all these extra people right in mix.”Morrow has espoused a wide range of extreme views on social media in recent years. Many of her past extreme comments were made on her now-dormant personal Twitter account — which is separate from her campaign account.Morrow also promoted QAnon slogans and tweeted that the actor Jim Carrey was “… likely searching for adrenochrome” – a reference to a conspiracy theory shared by QAnon believers that celebrities harvest and drink the blood of children to prolong their own lives. Media Matters, a left-leaning publication, was first to report the QAnon tweets.All together, Morrow tweeted “WWG1WGA” – the slogan that stands for “where we go one, we go all” and is commonly associated with the QAnon conspiracy – more than seven times in 2020.Central to QAnon lore is the notion of the “Storm,” a belief there will be a day when thousands will purportedly be arrested, subjected to military tribunals, and face mass executions for their alleged crimes, with Donald Trump leading efforts to dismantle them alongside other QAnon “patriots.”Morrow’s post about publicly executing Obama was just one of numerous she has made espousing carrying out violent fantasies against Democrats.On Twitter, the platform now known as X, and on the now-defunct conservative Twitter alternative, Parler, Morrow used the hashtag “#DeathtoTraitors” a combined 12 times – usually in relation to prominent Democrats.“Obama did it. Hillary did it. Schiff did it. Comey did it. Yates did it. Holder did it. Clapper did it. Gates did it. Fauci did it.

Ilhan Omar and other Democrats, suggesting their impending death for unspecified “treason.”“@IlhanMN and her other law-hating Dems must be getting a little nervous. Are they just realizing the punishment for treason is death?!?” Morrow wrote.In a post on Parler, Morrow used the hashtag #deathtotraitors in discussing the Democratic governors of North Carolina and New York, Cooper and Cuomo. Morrow publicized her Parler handle in a tweet and CNN found the deleted Parler posts on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.“Our Communist sympathizer, Comrade Cooper, has the same plans for NC!Expose them NOW!Can we we see the CCP list, @SecPompeo??? #PrisonTimeforFederalCrimes #DeathToTraitors #FreeOurCitizens,” Morrow wrote in 2020, discussing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.In other posts on Parler, Morrow shared posts from other users and a QAnon account about locking up Democrats at Guantanamo Bay and prisons.Morrow’s ire also went beyond Democrats, including one post in December 2020 calling for putting Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia in prison after he certified Georgia’s results for Joe Biden in that year’s presidential election.In other comments, Morrow repeatedly shared the false claim that Obama was Muslim, called Islam evil, and expressed belief in a conspiracy theory that tens of thousands of Chinese troops were stationed in Canada to invade the United States to help Joe Biden become president.“Tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers are already in Canada and probably Mexico waiting for orders to invade,” she wrote on January 8, 2021.In another post from September 2019, Morrow said that Barack Obama (referred to as B.O.) was a puppet for the “Deep State” and the “Muslim movement” and suggested he pay the highest penalty for his alleged crimes.“B.O. was a puppet for the Deep State and the Muslim movement to destroy our Constitutional Republic. We cannot give up until ALL the guilty pay the highest penalty for their crimes. We will lose our country #SAVEOURNATION #JusticeForAll #TraitorsMustPay“The DEEP STATE globalists and Muslim extremists, intent on destroying America, placed Omar and MANY others into our govt. #WakeUpAmerica #IslamIsEvil #ToleranceIsDeadly,” she wrote in January 2020.In one post, Morrow said Muslims should be banned from elected office in the United States and said Rep. Omar, who came to the United States as a refugee, should, “head back to Somalia.”This story has been updated with a tweet from Michele Morrow referencing this story after publication."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday he will extend an invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress after members of his conference encouraged him to do so.“We will certainly extend that invitation,” Johnson said on CNBC.It’s unclear whether Johnson intended to invite Netanyahu to address both chambers of Congress or just the House of Representatives specifically. An invitation to address a joint session of Congress would require buy-in from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who sharply criticized Netanyahu in a floor speech last week and called for Israel to hold new elections.According to a Schumer spokesperson, Johnson hasn’t discussed the possibility of Netanyahu delivering an address to a joint session with the Senate majority leader.In response to Johnson’s invitation to Netanyahu, Schumer said in a statement: “Israel has no stronger ally than the United States and our relationship transcends any one president or any one Prime Minister. I will always welcome the opportunity for the Prime Minister of Israel to speak to Congress in a bipartisan way.”Netanyahu has responded with sharp criticism of Schumer of his own following the New York Democrat’s floor speech, and also addressed Senate Republicans via a video conference at their closed-door lunch on Wednesday.On Thursday, Johnson also revealed he has been invited by Netanyahu to speak at the Knesset and that it would be a “great honor” to do so. Johnson’s predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, addressed the Knesset when he was speaker.The consideration of having Netanyahu address Congress also comes at a time when additional military aid to Israel appears stalled on Capitol Hill. The House passed a standalone military aid bill to Israel in November that the Senate did not advance because the House bill offset the cost with cuts to the IRS. The Senate passed a bill with aid to Ukraine and Israel in February, but Johnson has made no effort to put that legislation up for a vote in the chamber as House Republicans have mulled several alternatives for sending aid overseas.House Democrats pointed to the stalled funding at a news conference Thursday.“That bill needs to come to the floor,” House Minority Whip Katherine Clark said of the Senate-passed foreign aid bill. “So you can invite whomever you like to come and address Congress, but do the work that needs to be done.”This story has been updated with additional developments."

        "title": "Truth Social made Trump richer and gave him a new megaphone. But it’s struggling as a social media site",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "When he’s not raising horses or working at a construction site, 28-year-old Nick Mirtschink says he spends “a lot” of time on Truth Social, the social media platform started by Donald Trump.So does Bree Duke, a retiree from northwest Georgia, who said she regularly checks in with Trump’s frequent posts, called “truths.”“I love it,” Duke told CNN. “I have it on my TV, and I have it on my phone.”Mirtschink and Duke shared their glowing reviews of the app while attending Trump’s recent rally in Rome, Georgia, where regular users of Truth Social were easy to come by. Outside of his MAGA movement, though, the social media site is struggling to find a wider audience. It is hemorrhaging users, and its traffic has plummeted. There were roughly 860,000 accounts active on the site as of November – a tiny blip compared with more mainstream platforms.And yet, on Friday, Digital World Acquisition Corp. approved a lucrative merger with Trump Media & Technology Group, Truth Social’s owner – one that is expected to deliver a multibillion-dollar windfall for the former president just as mounting legal troubles and judgments have compromised his business empire, personal wealth and campaign finances. It won’t bring immediate relief, though, as Trump is restricted from selling his shares for six months.It’s a critical milestone for the social media site as well as for Trump, providing a path for the former real estate tycoon’s return to Wall Street. The company will trade under the ticker DJT, putting Trump’s initials alongside some of the most iconic brands and corporations in the world just as Trump Tower once did.For Trump, whose animated and antagonistic Twitter presence helped him chart a path to the presidency, the social media site has also become a new megaphone for his unvarnished opinions. His most devoted followers, political reporters and even his own staff and advisers rely on the site for a window into his latest thinking, which he shares across dozens of posts a day.But as Trump’s foray as a social media mogul enters its third year, the app’s long-term viability – and purpose – remain unclear. Truth Social is not a serious threat to compete with, let alone eclipse, X, Facebook or YouTube – it’s not among the 100 most downloaded social media applications in the Apple App store – nor has it separated itself as their conservative alternative. Trump Media’s management warned last year that the company was at risk of insolvency without a merger, and most analysts are skeptical of its current valuation above $6 billion.“It’s grossly overvalued,” Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida, told CNN this week. “It qualifies as a meme stock for which the price is divorced from fundamental value.”Instead, the sky-high appraisal appears closely tied to Trump’s political comeback attempt. But Truth Social has not proved it can survive, let alone thrive, unless the nation’s gaze is affixed on the site’s most famous user.“Truth Social’s clout is driven very much if not entirely by Donald Trump’s popularity,” said Josephine Lukito, who researches the intersection of politics and social media at the University of Texas at Austin. “Without him, I don’t think there’s a viable path forward for it.”Truth Social launched in early 2022, a year after Twitter, now known as X, and Facebook had locked Trump out of his accounts over his incitement of the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. Both platforms have since reinstated Trump’s account, though he posts almost exclusively to Truth Social.Trump recently told a South Carolina audience he bought the name of his app for $2,100 from “a guy.”“I would’ve paid millions,” Trump claimed to the crowd.Some conservatives, looking for an alternative to mainstream social media sites seen as hostile to their point of view, initially seemed eager to embrace Truth Social. A 2021 survey found that 3 in 5 Republicans expected to use the new site.“Get ready!” Trump wrote in his first Truth Social post. “Your favorite president will see you soon.”But the hype for the app exceeded actual usage. Three months after it launched, only 2% of Americans reported regularly using Truth Social to get their news, Pew Research found, in line with other niche conservative social media alternatives such as Gettr and Rumble.Activity on the app has capsized since its early peaks. The site’s monthly active users on iOS and Android devices are down 39% year-over-year, according to Similarweb data shared with CNN earlier this month. Visits to the site on mobile and desktop have plummeted as well by nearly 29% during that stretch.The app itself is somewhat clunky and not without technological problems. It appeared to go down during President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address when Trump promised to provide live commentary.CNN attempted to reach Truth Social for comment through an email address on its website. The email bounced back.Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman, said in a statement last month after US regulators allowed for the merger: “Moving forward, we aim to accelerate our work to build a free speech highway outside the stifling stranglehold of Big Tech.”Trump insists Truth Social is “on fire,” as he has put it. He regularly promotes the app at his rallies and during interviews. For example, Trump recently plugged Truth Social while recounting for an audience his post in support of in vitro fertilization treatments after an Alabama Supreme Court ruling led some clinics to halt access to some IVF services in the state.“The ultimate joy in life is a beautiful, healthy, wonderful baby,” Trump said, before adding: “I put that message out on a thing called Truth Social. Has anybody been tuning in lately? Hot. Truth Social’s hot.”Many Republican politicians and conservative have not joined Truth Social or they post infrequently. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s last post was in July 2022. Popular conservative podcast hosts Megyn Kelly, Ben Shapiro and Glenn Beck don’t appear to have active accounts. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott only recently joined Truth Social – just as his name surfaced as a potential running mate to Trump.Even those who have embraced Truth Social continue to be active on its competitor platforms – including those in Trump’s inner circle.“His surrogates are very active on X. They’re active on other platforms,” said Matt Terrill, who was chief of staff for the 2016 presidential campaign of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another prolific social media user. “It’s a recognition that is where a lot of people are getting their news.”To his supporters, the venture is further evidence of Trump’s business acumen, a reputation he built during a career working in real estate and as a reality television personality.“It’s brilliant because by the sheer virtue that we’re having this conversation right now, it’s impressive,” Paul Leslie, a writer who attended Trump’s Georgia rally told CNN. “You create your own social media platform and then people even talk about the fact that, ‘Oh, you’re not on Twitter.’ It’s just another source of press, and as anybody can clearly see, there’s never been a more impressive public relations genius than Donald Trump.”On any given day, Trump will post dozens of times to Truth Social, providing a running stream of commentary on his legal troubles, sharing favorable poll numbers, responding to negative coverage and weighing in on the political disputes of the day.It’s on Truth Social that Trump first commented on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s exit from the race.On Friday alone, Trump attacked the judge and state attorney general in one of his legal cases, expressed support for Cuban protesters, endorsed an Arizona state Senate candidate, shared eight videos of him speaking straight to camera and suggested he has enough money to cover the $464 million civil fraud judgment in New York — a potentially troubling admission for his legal team.The posts replicate Trump’s past social media usage – and style; he often posts in all-caps – but with only a fraction of the reach. On X, the site formerly known as Twitter now owned by billionaire Elon Musk, Trump has 87 million followers – 13 times his audience on Truth Social.“It’s safe to say that Truth Social has not broken into the mainstream,” said Joshua Tucker, co-director of the New York University Center for Social Media and Politics. “It’s a place for smaller groups of conservatives to congregate and for Trump to speak to some of his supporters.”To some of those supporters, that’s a feature, and not a bug.“I think that’s definitely a good thing, him being off of Twitter,” Mirtschink said at the Georgia rally. “Because Twitter has a bunch of Democrats on there.”Kurt Holtzclaw, a 20-year-old construction worker and Trump supporter, acknowledged having to sift through a fair amount of Truth Social content from conspiratorial accounts that may be blocked on other platforms.“I like to get my information from a wide variety of sources,” Holtzclaw said. “But I like to get his point of view.”Where Truth Social has succeeded has mostly benefited one person: Trump. As the former president reemerged as the front-runner for the Republican nomination, Truth Social gained considerably more mentions in news coverage from reporters mining the site for Trump’s thoughts on the race, said Lukito, the University of Texas professor. That has only accelerated since Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee.“One of the misconceptions is that what’s important is how big is it going to get relative to Twitter or how much money it’s earning,” Lukito said. “The reality is he’s winning because he’s able to successfully leverage media coverage through Truth Social. Most people learn about it not because they’re on the platform but because they see it in the media.”Trump recently acknowledged this phenomenon after Jimmy Kimmel made fun of the former president’s commentary of his performance hosting the Academy Awards.“He ends up reading my truth. E (sic) said this guy’s even dumber than I thought,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “The thing went viral. It’s been all over the world now, and all he had to do was keep his mouth shut.”Still, even some of his supporters long for the days when Trump’s posts reached a broader audience.“Trump would tweet and, oh boy, was everyone offended at that,” Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said at the recent Trump rally. “I tell you what, I’d give anything for some good old Trump tweets. Hey, you know, you can find him on Truth Social. You know where he’s at.”"

        "title": "Trump stares down first derailment of his campaign-to-courthouse strategy",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "For days, Donald Trump’s fury over the requirement to secure hundreds of millions of dollars in bond money by Monday has been bubbling behind the scenes and through a steady stream of social media posts.Friday’s public barrage on his Truth Social platform, which included multiple all-caps posts, highlighted his persistent anger with the judge who handed down the $464 million judgment, the New York attorney general who brought the civil fraud case and Trump’s insistence that it’s all designed to derail his presidential campaign.The posts, including one sent just before 2 a.m. Friday, contained a mix of invective and claims devoid of fact or evidence. (There is no evidence that the White House has played any role in the case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, let alone ordered her to pursue her effort. Nor is there any evidence that Trump, as he claimed, has plans to use any of his own money for his presidential campaign.)But also embedded in the posts was a reality that has pushed Trump’s company and personal finances to the brink with just two days remaining to land a solution.Trump, as he himself noted, does have a significant amount of cash, according to a review of his most recent candidate financial disclosure and personal financial statements.It’s a point he made repeatedly in his deposition and testimony during the New York fraud trial though that diverged from his latest social media claim of having “almost five hundred million dollars in cash.” He consistently pegged the number during legal proceedings at $400 million and, barring any recent and unreported cash infusion, a person familiar with his finances confirmed that remains roughly where his cash holdings stand.Yet even if the higher-end estimate is accurate, as Trump’s lawyers have made clear in sober, detailed filings, it wouldn’t be enough.The $464 million decision levied in the verdict, and the bond Trump is scrambling to secure to forestall potential seizure of his properties, would require cash or cash equivalent of roughly $557 million based on industry practice.And at least some of the money Trump does have is tied up in loan agreements that include terms requiring him to have tens of millions of dollars in cash on hand.In other words, as the clock ticks toward the Monday deadline, securing a bond of the scale required remains – to quote Trump’s own lawyers – a “practical impossibility.”Trump’s deft navigation of – and ability to leverage – his unprecedented collision of the campaign and courthouse has defined the path he bulldozed to once again become the Republican Party’s presumptive presidential nominee.But it was a filing by New York state lawyers at a county clerk’s office 25 miles north of Trump Tower that demonstrated how perilously close the former president is to a dramatic derailment of that strategy.The move by James’ office to enter judgments in Westchester County marked a first step toward seizing Trump’s assets should he fail to secure a bond.Westchester County is home to Trump’s golf course and private estate known as Seven Springs.The initial action, which state lawyers already took in Manhattan, is just the start to what would be a complex and lengthy process.It also came as Trump’s lawyers have continued to press to reduce or waive the bond requirement, calling it “patently unreasonable, unjust and unconstitutional,” in a Wednesday filing.But for Trump, a man who has made his brand and his buildings his central animating feature, the filing that put a target on one of his properties crystalized a moment unlike any other he’s faced in his White House comeback bid.“I think the whole thing is bullsh*t,” one House Republican, who communicates with Trump’s team said of the order to secure the $464 million bond while waiting for a decision on his appeal. “But it had gotten to the point where it seemed like nothing will ever stick to him, so this has been different.”In other words, there may be actual consequences.Over nearly a year, as four indictments and 88 charges piled on, Trump’s poll numbers in the GOP primary tracked a steady climb.Days when Trump faced charges, or showed up at court to face those charges, consistently ranked among his best fundraising days on the campaign.That money, in part, has covered Trump’s legal bills so he wouldn’t have to on his own.The lawyers that money financed have been both unequivocal about their pursuit of dilatory strategies – and have repeatedly succeeded in those efforts.If, as countless former campaign officials say, presidential candidates’ most valuable asset is their time, Trump’s decision to repeatedly attend court hearings when his presence wasn’t required made clear his view of the incentives. So did the voters.Trump successfully cut down – with relative ease – the best financed and most politically gifted of his primary challengers. He all but locked up the GOP nomination after just two primary contests as the party largely fell in line behind a candidate under whose tenure it lost the House, the Senate and the White House.Trump was also the same candidate whom some publicly – and many more privately – had hoped would simply disappear after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and the steady stream of revelations that he and his advisers had sought to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 victory.People around Trump say they’ve seen no sign of any political damage from his latest legal stress test. National polls continue to show a margin-of-error contest with Biden, and more importantly, surveys in the critical swing states haven’t revealed a tangible shift. New CNN polling conducted by SSRS in two battleground states showed Trump tied with Biden in Pennsylvania at 46% each, and ahead in Michigan, 50% to 42%.Biden flipped both states from Trump’s column in 2020.Trump’s campaign apparatus trails Biden’s team significantly in fundraising, but those around Trump are confident that the gap will be closed. The former president, these people say, has been privately working the party’s biggest donors in a way they haven’t seen before.“The money will be there,” one person told CNN. “He’s never been more focused or effective on that front than he is right now.”One adviser mused that any pursuit of Trump’s properties would only serve to help the campaign politically, pointing to email and text donation appeals with lines like “Keep your filthy hands off Trump Tower!” as evidence to that effect.Still, the threat Trump currently faces cuts equally to his political and personal core. It’s also one that carries a level of irony.In a career, and now verdict, beset by a steady stream of questions about his net worth and the value of his substantial real estate assets, Trump does have a significant amount of cash – and a valuable portfolio of properties, which could more than cover the bond amount.But insurers rarely take real estate as collateral, fearing a complex process and skewed market where any bids on that property would come from entities well aware of the need to sell, Trump’s lawyers said.One insurer, Chubb, underwrote a $91.63 million bond just two weeks ago in another Trump legal loss – E. Jean Carroll’s defamation case.Trump’s team had been in discussions with Chubb over a second bond for the fraud case that included a mix of liquid assets and property. In the past week, the insurer informed Trump’s team it could not accept property as collateral.In total, 30 insurers contacted by Trump’s team declined to pursue the effort to secure a bond. Trump, in a Truth Social posting, alluded to that fact when he noted that it “is not possible for bonding companies to do in such a high amount, before I can even Appeal. That is CRAZY! If I sold assets, and then won the Appeal, the assets would be forever gone.”There has been a steady stream of rumors about some of Trump’s richest backers stepping in to put up the cash.But so far there has been no confirmation of concrete requests, let alone movement toward any agreement.Another potential pathway that Trump allies have discussed opened up Friday when investors approved a merger that made the former president’s media enterprise, Trump Media and Technology Group, a public company. Trump’s holdings in the new company would, on their face, net him billions in stock.But the availability of that cash from the parent company of Truth Social would be subject to a six month “lockup” period that would hamstring Trump’s ability to sell any shares or use them as collateral. The billions Trump stands to gain exist only on paper – and would be subject to the price fluctuations of the stock when it starts to trade.Any effort by Trump to get around that lockup period in order to monetize his shares would likely have a direct, and negative, effect on the stock’s price.Trump has repeatedly dismissed the idea of pursuing bankruptcy, which would freeze the proceedings for what would likely be an extended period of time.The reasons, advisers say, cut across personal and political concerns.Trump has been publicly vocal about the deep scars he carries from bankruptcies decades ago.“It was an experience that I don’t think I want to go through it again,” Trump said in a 1992 interview with Charlie Rose. “You’re really in a position where I think that if you had to do it again, I’m not sure you could. I went through a period of two years that was truly tough.”Trump is also cognizant of the potential threat it could pose to his carefully crafted image that sits at the heart of his political salience: that of a billionaire business tycoon.“No chance,” one adviser said of Trump pursuing bankruptcy. “He’d rather have Letitia James show up and try and seize his properties.”Whether that version of the campaign and courthouse convergence plays out will be made clear in the days ahead.For now, however, it has become clear as the deadline to secure the bond looms ever closer, that the playbook that has driven Trump’s political comeback has run into hurdles in the form of hundreds of millions of dollars.That’s a problem the only political opponent who has ever defeated Trump is happy to highlight.“I know not everyone is feeling the enthusiasm,” Biden joked at a Dallas fundraising reception this week. “Just the other day a defeated-looking man came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, I have crushing debt, and I’m completely wiped out.’ And I had to look at him and say, ‘Donald, I’m sorry. I can’t help you.’”"

        "title": "New York Attorney General takes initial step to prepare to seize Trump assets",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The New York attorney general’s office has filed judgments in Westchester County, the first indication that the state is preparing to try to seize Donald Trump’s golf course and private estate north of Manhattan, known as Seven Springs.State lawyers entered the judgments with the clerk’s office in Westchester County on March 6, just one week after Judge Arthur Engoron made official his $464 million decision against Trump, his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and the Trump Organization.The decision against Trump and the difficulty the former president is having securing a bond while he appeals the verdict strikes directly at Trump’s image as a billionaire as he attempts to raise more cash for both his legal bills and third run for the White House.Entering a judgment would be the first step a creditor would take to attempt to recover property. Additional steps, such as putting liens on assets or moving to foreclose on properties, or taking other actions in court would follow, if the asset is going to be seized.The judgment is already entered in New York city where Trump’s properties including Trump Tower, his penthouse at Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street, his hotel abutting Central Park, and numerous apartment buildings are located.Judgments have not been entered in Florida counties including Miami or Palm Beach where Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property and the Trump National Doral Golf Club and resort are located or Cook County, Illinois, where Trump’s hotel in Chicago is located, according to a review of records Thursday by CNN.Trump now has four days to satisfy the judgment or sway an appeals court to allow him to post a smaller amount or defer posting the payment until after the appeal.In a new Truth Social on Thursday, Trump said that putting up the money is “VERY EXPENSIVE” and said it was “not possible for bonding companies to do in such a high amount.”The attorney general’s office will be allowed to file a written response to Trump’s claims, a New York appeals court said Friday.The process to seize assets would not be quick or easy. Trump has structured his business by setting up limited liability companies for nearly every property or asset – over 300 in total – which ultimately are controlled by his trust.“They are complexly organized and he is not on paper the owner and therefore a judgment against him would not be executable directly against certain properties. Sorting this out is not going to be simple and it’s not going to be quick,” said Nikos Passas, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Northeastern University.“In the meantime, she could also obtain bank levies and go after the bank assets. She could put liens on properties. There are all kinds of things that she’s able to do in an effort to collect,” Passas said.“All this is completely undermining the brand, which he uses for the most part for making any kind of money around the world not just the United States,” Passas said. “In the end I think this could very much mean the end of Trump business in New York and not only – it could spell trouble in other jurisdictions too.”Separately, Trump’s lawyers pushed back Thursday on several of the suggestions the New York attorney general’s office made about how he can pay bond.That includes the idea that Trump could get several underwriters to secure bonds totaling the judgment – saying it would still require Trump to post half a billion dollars in cash or stock – money he doesn’t have.Trump’s legal team argued in the filing that the New York attorney general’s office shouldn’t be able to challenge their claims.If no arrangement is met, New York Attorney General Letitia James has said she will take steps to seize assets.The attorney general’s office on Wednesday said that it’s common for large companies to post billion-dollar bonds and suggested Trump should have posted real estate with the court.“The suggestion is both impractical and unjust. The Attorney General cites no New York case law to support this contention. In any event, from the perspective of risk, the Attorney General’s proposal of a ‘court-appointed officer’ to ‘hold real estate’ is functionally equivalent to what Supreme Court has already imposed through the requirement of a court-appointed monitor to oversee Defendants’ business operations,” Trump’s lawyers wrote.Trump’s lawyers also said to be forced to sell properties at a fire sale would cause irreparable injury because they could not later recover the property if they were to win an aspect of the appeal.“By demanding an undertaking in the full amount of the judgment in order to appeal, the Attorney General and Supreme Court have sought to impose a patently unreasonable, unjust, and unconstitutional (under both the Federal and New York State Constitutions) bond condition,” they wrote.Thursday, Engoron expanded the role of the monitor overseeing the Trump Organization to include more expansive oversight of Trump’s real estate business’ internal financial practices.Engoron also ordered the Trump Organization to supply detailed information to the monitor about its efforts to obtain bonds to cover judgments.“The Trump Organization shall inform the monitor, in advance, of any efforts to secure surety bonds, including any financial disclosures requested or required, any information provided in response to such requests, any representations made by Trump Organization in connection with securing such bonds any personal guarantees made by any of the defendants, and any obligations of the Trump Organization required by the surety,” the judge ordered.Engoron laid out a timeline of certain steps the Trumps must take within the next month, including providing the monitor, retired Judge Barbara Jones, with full access to its day-to-day financial operations.In two months, the judge said, the monitor is ordered to submit a report “describing her assessment of the Trump Organization’s internal controls and shall recommend proper internal controls for the Trump Organization.”He also put the Trumps on notice that he may order them to implement the monitor’s recommendations.Engoron also empowered the monitor to have copies of the Trump Organization’s monthly bank and brokerage statements, be notified in advance of any transfers above $5 million, be provided information about the creation or dissolution of business entities, and be informed in advance of any debt financing.This story has been updated with additional developments."

        "title": "Supreme Court escalates high-stakes border drama between Biden, Texas and Trump",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "For a few fleeting hours Tuesday, Texas was able to enforce a hardline immigration law blasted by critics as an affront to human rights – thanks to a huge assist from the conservative majority on the US Supreme Court.The intervention by the nation’s top bench triggered a day of twisting legal drama that only exacerbated the chaos over the nation’s overwhelmed immigration system, reinforced the politicization of the court and stoked fresh controversy over an issue that threatens President Joe Biden’s reelection.The measure allows Texas to arrest and even deport people it suspects of crossing the border illegally – a flagrant challenge to the federal government’s authority on such issues.It came into force, briefly, after the Supreme Court said the law could proceed while an appeals process plays out in lower courts. But late Tuesday evening, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals put the law on hold again – muting celebrations in the Lone Star State. The panel of judges that issued the late-night ruling is already due to hear arguments Wednesday morning over the statute, known as SB 4.The fresh uncertainty about the law will only supercharge a fierce debate over immigration fueled by Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump as the general election heats up. And even though it was later overtaken, the Supreme Court’s move allowed Republicans to showcase their tough immigration policies and claim that Biden has lost control of the border.The legal back-and-forth will also set off more feuding between Washington and the ultra-conservative government of Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott over policy and enforcement.The Supreme Court stepped into the controversy weeks after Republicans in Congress killed off a conservative compromise that stiffened border and asylum policy and included huge concessions from Biden as he seeks to ease his exposure on the issue at the risk of alienating progressives. Some top Republicans blamed Trump for working to scupper the measure to deprive Biden of an important win in during the election year.A federal judge in Austin had blocked the state government from implementing the Texas law. But the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay of the lower court’s decision, which prompted a pair of emergency appeals from the Biden administration and others. The Supreme Court said Tuesday the law can go into force while the 5th Circuit appeals process plays out.In a brief order Tuesday night, a three-judge panel at the 5th Circuit voted 2-1 to wipe away a previous ruling from a different panel that had temporarily put the law into effect. So a day of shifting legal fortunes ended with the Texas law still not implemented.Republicans in Texas say that the law’s enforcement mechanisms are well within their constitutional rights as a state. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, for example, hailed the Supreme Court move on X as “a huge win.” But if the law does go back into effect, much will depend on how Texas and its law enforcement authorities in more conservative jurisdictions in the state implement the law and if they use its full extent – to arrest and deport suspected undocumented migrants.Immigrant advocacy groups have warned that the law could lead to racial profiling and civil rights violations and arrests that could terrorize undocumented migrants far from border areas. “Today is March 19, a day that, I believe, will be known in infamy as a ‘show me your papers day,’” said LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens) national president Domingo Garcia. Abbott, however, has argued that police officers in Texas know that racial profiling is wrong.Supreme Court justices are supposed to make decisions only with respect to the law, not potential political consequences. In a concurrence to the decision, conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett stressed that it should not be up to the court to intervene when lower courts like the 5th Circuit issue a temporary stay of a decision.But the Supreme Court’s intervention was its latest foray into fraught political territory. It will play into criticisms among Democrats that the court is boosting conservative interests that helped build its majority and that it is in tacit alliance with right-wing legislators, governors and candidates. In the most controversial recent move, the court agreed to hear Trump’s expansive claim of presidential immunity, delaying his federal election interference trial and raising the prospect the former president could avoid accountability for trying to overturn the 2020 election before he faces voters again in 2024.Similar arguments played out when the Supreme Court ditched decades of precedent and overturned the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion in 2022 – a decision that led to the current patchwork of state restrictions and policies that has caused chaos in the health care system. The overturning of Roe v. Wade has also caused subsequent legal reverberations – for instance the pausing of some IVF fertility treatments in Alabama after the state’s Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are children.Immigration reform advocates fear that a similar web of contradicting state laws and tensions between federal and state power could be in store on immigration if the Texas law is ultimately allowed to go into effect for the long term.The White House issued a scathing response to the Supreme Court’s decision, arguing it would make Texas less safe, burden law enforcement and “sow chaos and confusion at our southern border.” Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre warned that SB 4 was “another example of Republican officials politicizing the border while blocking real solutions.”Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut predicted on CNN Tuesday that the Supreme Court decision would lead to “a mess.” He told Wolf Blitzer: “You can’t have two immigration enforcement systems – one run by the federal government and one run by the state government.” And Texas Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro warned in a statement that the “Supreme Court has opted to allow for a trial run of a constitutional crisis.”Beyond the politics, the Texas law comes with important constitutional and even international implications. It grants local and state law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and state judges the ability to issue orders to remove them to Mexico. The Department of Justice sued the state, arguing the federal government has exclusive authority to enforce immigration law. The prospect of Texas deporting migrants to Mexico also raises the possibility of an individual state taking actions that could have huge implications for relations between the United States and another sovereign power. The conduct of foreign affairs is reserved for the federal government in the constitution.The dispute over the Texas law follows several previous occasions when conservative-run states have sought to take actions to implement their own hardline immigration policies, causing a clash with the federal government. Last year, for instance, Florida – at a time when GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis was running for president – organized flights of undocumented migrants from Texas to liberal jurisdictions. If Texas eventually succeeds in implementing its own new law challenging federal government power to administer immigration, it would not be a surprise if other states try to follow suit.John Sandweg, who served as acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director in the Obama administration, told CNN he was stunned by the Supreme Court decision that he said flew in the face of long-standing precedent. He argued that when other states had tried to enforce their own border enforcement schemes, “the court has shut them down.”The president is under huge pressure to address a glaring weakness over immigration. A CNN poll last released month showed just 30% of Americans approved of his performance on the issue and 79% of voters – including majorities across party lines – said that the situation on the border represents a crisis. While conservative media and politicians have spent years trolling the president with misleading coverage about migrant caravan invasions and open borders, the high interception of border crossers also deeply worries many non-conservative voters.As he did when congressional Republicans thwarted the border bill recently, Biden is expected to argue that their hardline policies are making things worse. Even before Tuesday’s ruling, the president significantly stepped up his own rhetoric on immigration, blasting his predecessor and rival for his tone over the weekend.“He separated kids and parents at the border, and encaged children. Planning mass deportations of literally several million people who are here in the country. Several million people. And he wants to end birthright citizenship,” Biden said on Univision Radio on Tuesday.“I mean, this guy despises Latinos,” the president said, as he headed off on a tour of swing states Arizona and Nevada, where the immigration issue is paramount and where he needs to shore up his defenses against Trump."

        "title": "You don’t have to admit there’s a climate crisis to be fighting climate change",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Although many Americans and policy wonks see climate change as the major existential issue of our time, it ends up feeling like a relatively small piece of the American political conversation, which is more focused on the economy, immigration and democracy.The climate crisis ends up touching on all of those issues, as CNN’s chief climate correspondent Bill Weir told me. His new book, “Life As We Know It (Can Be): Stories of People, Climate and Hope in a Changing World,” comes out on April 16. We talked on the phone about his recent trip to Massachusetts, where some beachfront homeowners who want the state to do more to help protect the area from erosion and rising sea levels also deny the climate is in crisis.My conversation with Weir, edited for clarity, is below:WOLF: You’re on the ground covering the climate crisis every day. Where has that taken you recently?WEIR: To both ends of the spectrum. It’s the grim reality of what’s unfolding and also, we’re working on a special on innovation.Most recently, I was in Salisbury, Massachusetts, on the New Hampshire border where folks there, over the generations, have watched the high tide get higher, year by year. As is the case along the Atlantic coast, erosion is accelerating along with sea level rise.And so this year, over 100 homeowners banded together, spent $600,000 on 15,000 tons of sand in order to fortify their beachside homes from storms and higher tides. In years past, that would last them three or four years, but then they got yet another freak storm and high tide and most of it was washed away in a single day.They’re coming to grips in various forms with the five stages of climate grief. They very much want the state to kick in.I met some neighbors who refuse to acknowledge climate science and just believe that this is a string of bad luck, a one-off series of unfortunate events. Others are coming around to the to the idea and the actual scientific warnings that Massachusetts is bracing for, officially, a couple of feet of sea level rise above year 2000 levels just in the next decade or two.This was a fascinating case study in the psychology about it, and how people who don’t really acknowledge the warnings of science are the ones most dedicated to saving what’s there now, and so are a vital part of bracing for what’s unfolding.WEIR: I went down to Florida and met with a couple of inspirational developers. One is Syd Kitson, a former NFL player, who built the first solar power town in America. It’s called Babcock Ranch, Florida.I was riding out Hurricane Ian a few miles away where everything was plunged into darkness and flooded. But because of his designs and ideas, they never lost power and never flooded, and as a result, the demand for people to buy homes in Babcock Ranch has skyrocketed. He’s building them as fast as he can.And so I’m looking at glimpses into how the climate crisis is already changing neighborhoods and which direction we’re likely to go when it comes to construction and food supplies and energy. It’s all changing incredibly fast – an industrial revolution that nobody’s talking about.WOLF: You did another story recently about Buffalo as a landing spot for climate refugees. I think it’s interesting that on the one hand, you’re talking to people who are making it so that we can withstand climate change in Florida, but then also thinking about where people are eventually going to have to move because of climate change. How far out is the horizon where we actually see people moving away from the Sunbelt because that’s where people have been moving to for so long?WEIR: It’s a fascinating question for different reasons. Five thousand people who were driven out of Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria went to Buffalo for refuge because there’s a Puerto Rican community there; 3,000 of them stayed.The city embraced that. They need folks to revitalize these Rust Belt towns, and they have a ton of fresh water and clean energy with Niagara Falls. So they’ve declared themselves a climate refuge. For them, it’s not just the latitude, it’s the attitude around migration.At the same time, for the first time in human history, sun and wind energy are the cheapest forms of energy. And so the sun belts, now we’re gonna think of them as the solar belts, and the wind belts, the high plains of Texas, are going to be a huge magnet for big manufacturing who need a lot of abundant energy.Texas now leads the nation in clean energy just because of the economics, despite the politics and ideology. Bright-red Texas is the greenest state right now. The math, the economics of it, is going to change the landscape of what attracts companies, and then as a result, what attracts workers.But ultimately, the heat is going to win. As the belly on the planet becomes more intolerable, the northern latitudes become that much more attractive.Alaska could be the new Florida for retirees. It’ll be a lot wetter up there. But the band of the United States from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon, across the Great Lakes is a refuge that is best positioned for that.The UN predicts tens of millions of folks forced to cross borders by sudden, unnatural disasters. You can see what’s happening on the border now. And as droughts get worse in Central America, you can just play it out. The strain is going to go up.WOLF: It’s interesting to hear you say that about Texas, because the governor and the Republican-dominated legislature there would seemingly be opposed to doing anything specifically because of climate change. But if there’s a capitalist urge, people seem more in tune with it. Joe Biden has tried to make the argument that addressing climate change should be an economic boom. Do you think that even if people are unwilling to accept that climate change is happening, they still might be doing things to address it?WEIR: Oh, absolutely. A story that I don’t get to tell enough is just this massive boom in renewables and clean energy and clean water tech.I think the most recent analysis was for every dollar spent by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, five-and-a-half bucks in private investment has chased that.And there are these massive growth rates in the sectors that people aren’t talking about – carbon removal, thermal storage, using big boxes of hot rocks to store clean energy, using the earth as a battery through pressure, geothermal – all of these things are exploding now.At the same time, the United States is the biggest petrostate in human history. Joe Biden has exported much more fossil fuels than Donald Trump. It’s the result of this big boom in fracked natural gas. That’s a big sticking point with the environmental wing of his base.The big question is how much this new energy boom replaces the old, dirty kind of energy or if we just are so ravenous in our appetites; humanity never cuts back.In places like Charleston (South Carolina), where they’re building a billion dollar seawall, and people are raising their 100-year-old mansions on the Battery, it’s not a political debate. It is reality. The physics are right there in your face.Matt Yglesias is among others who have said we shouldn’t talk too much about climate at all. Because the average person, when it comes to actual action, daily action, doesn’t really want to do it.WOLF: I’ve wondered about that with regard to electric vehicles. It seems like some people are turned off by them because it’s making a political statement when you buy an EV instead of simply trying to get the best deal.WEIR: I think what you’re seeing now is there’s been such sudden market saturation that now there’s a backlash, there’s a glut or an oversupply.These things happen in fits and starts. Offshore wind was super exciting. And then it hit inflation headwinds and supply chain problems. EVs were a novelty and a statement. And now there’s a tyranny of choice. There’s so many different models and sorting out all the incentives is still not easy.At the same time, we’ve crossed the point that I don’t think we’re going back to the internal combustion engine, as a species, the same way there was a certain point we weren’t going back to horses. It just makes more sense.Electrifying everything is the ultimate result, I think, of all this. It’s just a matter of how fast it takes.Look at these S-shaped curves of adaptation in history from the color television to the refrigerator that went from, you know, 10% of homes to 95% in a relatively short amount of time. We’ve seen that same thing with solar and battery storage, the same kind of thing with heat pumps. And there’s a big wave of efficiency and cleaner, more sustainable choices coming, regardless of the politics.WOLF: I read in CNN’s report that it was the warmest winter on record and that the planet was more than 2 degrees over the pre-industrial levels for a number of days in February. It seems clear that we’re going to burst through the 2-degree tipping point that had been previously suggested as the tipping point for climate change. What is the next marker?WEIR: The hardest thing for most folks to grasp – I still have a hard time grasping it even though I live in the space every day – is that the record-shattering year that we just had isn’t just the hottest year in 120,000 years or so. It’s among the coolest years of the rest of our lives.And there has been no meaningful reduction in emissions. The human hand on the global thermostat still has it cranked all the way up. And until that changes, until the atmosphere stabilizes at a certain rate, it’s just going to keep getting warmer.The really scary stuff is what we don’t see and what’s much harder to measure and to communicate, which is that the ocean temperatures have broken a record every day for the last year.Every new day on the calendar is the hottest such day that we’ve ever recorded. What that means for marine ecosystems and coral reefs, which are the cradles of life in the oceans, and what it means for the power of storms as we head into hurricane season has scientists really, really worried.WOLF: What are the little things that people should be doing? I don’t think anybody’s realistically asking people to stop travel completely. You travel to cover these stories. How do you layer the climate into your daily life?WEIR: When you take on this beat, you see everything in life differently. I used to just see an ice cream truck and smile. Now I see the fumes coming off the generator. I think about the sugarcane fields that burn to make delicious treats. Everything has a cost if you really think about it.I absolutely think about my flight footprint and for years would offset my air miles with clean energy projects that are vetted, charities I believe in.But we can’t offset our way out of this problem. We have to come up with a way to fly sustainably, and we have to figure out a way to build our homes and source our food and make our clothing in much more efficient and sensible ways.On the personal responsibility part of it, I do my best. I haven’t owned a car in a few years. I’m proud to say I have almost 4,000 miles on Citi Bikes (New York’s bike-share service), but I just like riding a bike. I’m not doing that to be some sort of Captain Planet statement maker; I just liked that way of getting around New York City. If I lived in Dallas or Chicago, it probably wouldn’t work.Personal choices are important because they’re an extension of our awareness of the problem of what’s in our air, what’s in our water, what our energy mix means for life as we know it and what it will mean for generations to come.What everybody chooses to do with that is important, but what is hugely important is talking about it. Letting it inform your choices as a consumer and a voter for sure. But also realizing that the decision-makers who work in C-suites of the biggest petrochemical companies, the biggest fossil fuel legacy companies in the world – you could fit all of them in a couple of Greyhound buses.Right now, governments are subsidizing fossil fuel. They’re paying companies to uncork the Godzilla that is changing weather in horrible ways. So until massive systems change, the best you can do as a consumer is just be aware and talk about it.WOLF: That’s kind of depressing. What am I missing?WEIR: There’s a couple of things that I like to point out. In 2022, if you asked the average American to guess how many of their fellow countrymen and women both understand the climate crisis and are supportive of meaningful action, the average response was 33% to 40%, regardless of party. In reality, it is like 66% to 80%.The authors of the paper call it “pluralistic ignorance.” If you care about an Earth in balance, you think you’re outnumbered two to one, when the opposite is true.People are surrounded by allies they didn’t know they had. People also underestimate how quickly nature can heal itself if given a chance and how quickly systems can adjust when people work together.The pandemic taught us a lot of lessons, but it also produced a number of vaccines in record time when everyone was focused on one mission. So there’s a lot of room for despair. But there’s so many reasons for hope, and it’s just really about the stories we tell around this topic."

        "title": "Mexico warns US court of ‘substantial tension’ if controversial Texas immigration law takes effect",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Mexico is warning a federal US court that if its judges permit a controversial Texas immigration law to take effect, the two nations would experience “substantial tension” that would have far-reaching consequences for US-Mexico relations.In a friend-of-the-court brief filed Thursday with the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for Mexico said relations with the US would be strained.“Enforcement of SB 4 would inappropriately burden the uniform and predictable sovereign-to-sovereign relations between Mexico and the United States, by criminalizing the unauthorized entry of noncitizens into Texas from outside the county and creating diverging removal requirements between and among individual states and the national government,” they wrote in the brief.“Enforcement of SB 4 would also interfere with Mexico’s right to determine its own policies regarding entry into its territory, undermine U.S.-Mexico collaboration on a legal migration framework and border management, and hinder U.S.-Mexico trade,” the attorneys told the court.Signed into law by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in December, the law makes entering Texas illegally a state crime and allows state judges to order immigrants to be deported. US immigration enforcement, generally, is a function of the federal government.The 5th Circuit is currently considering whether to allow Texas to enforce Senate Bill 4 while it weighs the larger question of whether the law violates the US Constitution. A three-judge panel at the appeals court put the law back on hold late Tuesday after the Supreme Court cleared the way for it to go into effect for a short period earlier that day.Briefs like the one filed by Mexico, which is technically called an amicus brief, are submitted by non-parties to offer a court expertise and information on a pending case. The decision to allow for amicus briefs comes under a court’s discretion. Some amici might file their briefs in support of a particular party or in support of neither party.Mexico said it was backing the law’s challengers, which include the Biden administration. Its attorneys argued in Thursday’s brief that the law – if allowed to take effect – “will be applied in a discriminatory manner.”Mexico’s 11 consulates in Texas have been ordered to provide protection and guidance and have made legal support available for any Mexican nationals across the state who “starts to have a problem,” under the new law, Mexican Foreign Minister Alicia Barcena said earlier Thursday.“This law is deeply unconstitutional,” Barcena said, arguing that immigration issues in the US are under federal jurisdiction, just like in Mexico.“So, we are not going to allow any action by the state of Texas, neither the authorities, nor the police, nor anyone who acts on immigration matters at a state level, at the county level, this is a federal matter and for us too. So we are there,” the minister said."

        "title": "Manhattan DA says no additional delay needed in Trump hush money criminal trial, blasts ‘grab-bag of meritless’ filings",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Manhattan prosecutors say fewer than 270 documents recently turned over to Donald Trump by federal authorities are new and relevant to the criminal case involving hush money payments and no further delay to the trial is warranted.Prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney’s office also told the judge that no sanctions were warranted and placed the blame on Trump’s lawyers for the late disclosure of records from the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York.Trump asked Judge Juan Merchan to dismiss the indictment and delay the trial for 90 days, alleging prosecutors withheld information from them involving the federal prosecution of Michael Cohen, Trump’s former fixer and a key witness for the state.In a series of filings Thursday, the district attorney’s office accused Trump’s lawyers of trying to allege a “grab-bag of meritless discovery arguments in the latest of a long series of attempts to evade responsibility for the conduct charged in the indictment.”“Defense counsel has likewise stretched the boundaries of zealous advocacy in this case,” the district attorney wrote.“Defendant’s motion and subsequent filings are a transparent attempt to shift the focus away from his own criminal conduct by pursuing remedies to which he is not entitled, including dismissal, a lengthy adjournment, and preclusion of evidence,” the DA added.The trial was set to start on March 25, but the judge postponed it to until at least April 15 over the dispute. The judge is holding a hearing on Monday to discuss the discovery issues and potentially settle on a new trial date.Prosecutors argued the trial should not be delayed any further. Merchan is holding a hearing on March 25 to discuss the matter.Prosecutors said a small number of the 33,000 records produced on March 13, based on their ongoing review, are new, writing the batch “contains only limited materials relevant to the subject matter of this case and that have not been disclosed to the defendant: fewer than an estimated 270 documents, most of which are inculpatory and corroborative of existing evidence.”They went on to say Trump’s allegations of misconduct are “wholly unfounded, and the circumstances here do not come close to warranting the extreme sanctions he has sought.”Prosecutors say they took steps to obtain records from federal prosecutors “including by requesting and obtaining extensive evidence about Cohen’s campaign finance convictions – all of which was then disclosed to defendant. Moreover, the belated nature of the recent USAO productions is entirely a result of defendant’s own inexplicable and strategic delay in identifying perceived deficiencies in the People’s disclosures and pursuing independent means to obtain that evidence.”The DA’s office turned over materials it obtained from federal prosecutors to Trump last June, but then Trump subpoenaed the federal prosecutors in January for information about their investigation and also special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference into the 2016 presidential election, which spun off the Cohen prosecution.The district attorney’s filings also addressed the airing of a documentary about Stormy Daniels one week before the trial was initially supposed to begin.The documentary on Daniels aired this week on Peacock, examining Daniels’ life navigating the roller coaster that followed the public revealing of the hush money payment that ultimately landed Trump’s former attorney Cohen in federal prison for breaking campaign finance laws.Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges related to the hush money payments and has denied the affair with Daniels.Trump’s attorneys have argued that the documentary is reason for the trial to be delayed because it could be prejudicial to the jury pool, while criticizing the district attorney’s office in their request for sanctions because of the “untimely” production of the documentary.The district attorney’s office says that it turned over the documentary to Trump’s lawyers once it had obtained it, and also dismissed arguments that the documentary was an attempt to prejudice the jury ahead of trial.“The argument rests entirely on the false claim that Ms. Daniels controlled the release date of the NBCUniversal documentary; she did not,” the district attorney writes.The filing noted that the district attorney subpoenaed NBCUniversal for the documentary, “obtained it on the earliest available day, and produced it to defendant one business day later — before it was public.”“That’s the polar opposite of concealment,” the district attorney argued.The filings also provide additional details on the more than 200,000 pages of discovery that the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York turned over this month – documents that prompted the judge to agree to a delay in the trial start date and to schedule Monday’s hearing to discuss the discovery issues.The 200,000 documents were turned over in response to a subpoena from Trump’s lawyers about the SDNY investigation into Cohen, including documents relied upon to establish probable cause for search warrants, documents on Cohen’s phones and email accounts and Cohen’s proffer agreements, among others.In addition, the district attorney’s office said it turned over in January and February notes from several of Cohen’s interviews with Mueller’s office.The US Attorney’s office did not possess those notes in January and March 2023 when the district attorney made the initial discovery request, and the DA says in its filing they were obtained through Freedom of Information Act litigation. Redacted versions of Cohen’s interviews with Mueller have been released publicly in response to FOIA lawsuits from CNN and other news organizations.This story and headline have been updated with additional developments."

        "title": "New FAFSA calculation error by Education Department could further delay some students’ college decisions",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The Department of Education said Friday that it has identified a vendor’s calculation error impacting several hundred thousand financial aid forms. The mistake could further delay students’ aid awards and, as a result, their decisions on where to go to college next year, financial aid experts warn.The new problem adds further complications to the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) process this year, which has been marked with delays and glitches after a long-awaited, updated version of the financial aid form was released.Typically, colleges send financial aid award letters to students in March and request a decision by May 1 on whether they plan to enroll the following fall. Many colleges – but not all – have already delayed this timeline due to the problems with the FAFSA.“This is another unforced error that will likely cause more processing delays for students,” Justin Draeger, CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, said in a statement.“At this stage in the game and after so many delays, every error adds up and will be felt acutely by every student who is counting on need-based financial aid to make their postsecondary dreams a reality,” he added.High school seniors have been slower to submit the FAFSA this year. As of March 15, nearly 31% fewer of them had filed compared with the prior class at that same point the year before, according to the National College Attainment Network.Students typically wait to receive financial aid award letters from colleges that accept them before deciding where to enroll next fall – and whether they can afford it. But colleges don’t usually send those award letters to students until the government transmits their FAFSA information.The Department of Education’s new mistake resulted in incorrect financial need information, known as Institutional Student Information Records, or ISIRs, being sent from the government to colleges. The error impacts ISIRs sent to schools prior to March 21, and the issue has been resolved for information sent on and after that date, the Department of Education said.The vast majority of the 1.5 million ISIRs delivered to colleges so far were not affected. The Department of Education has provided workaround instructions for colleges so that they can still process the impacted ISIRs to generate tentative aid packages for students.The Department of Education said that it discovered the miscalculation, made due to a “vendor issue,” when it started sending large numbers of ISIRs to colleges earlier in March. It specifically impacts dependent students who have their own assets to report on the FAFSA.“We will continue delivering large volumes of ISIRs to schools over the coming days as we continue to work through the over 6 million 2024-25 FAFSA submissions received to date,” the department said in a statement sent to CNN on Friday.Late last year, the Department of Education unveiled major changes to the FAFSA, as required by law. The new version is shorter, simpler and is expected to make more students eligible for financial aid – like federal Pell grants and loans, as well as college grants and scholarships.The Department of Education was required to release the new version by the end of 2023, and while it met that deadline, the form was only available sporadically, for about 30 minutes at a time, for the first two days. It was not made available 24 hours a day, seven days a week until January 8.Usually, the form is available on October 1, so this year’s application process was delayed from the start.Later in January, the Department of Education made a last-minute fix to tie the new financial aid calculation to the latest inflation data. The adjustment made $1.8 billion more in financial aid available to students but also slowed down FAFSA processing.At that point, the department said that it wouldn’t start sending ISIRs to colleges until the first half of March – more than a month later than expected and about the same time schools already want to have financial aid letters out the door to students.Meanwhile, students and families have experienced a number of glitches with the new form. At first, parents who don’t have Social Security numbers had problems starting a form for a student or contributing to one their child already started – even though they should be allowed to create an account with Federal Student Aid and access the form.The Department of Education has been facing criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for the delays, and the Government Accountability Office has started an investigation into the new form’s implementation.In February, the department announced several new steps it was taking to help colleges process the new FAFSA forms and develop student aid awards.The FAFSA has long been due for an update, and the new version released at the end of last year is a culmination of changes approved by Congress in 2019 and 2020.In previous years, the FAFSA could be as long as 108 questions. With the new form, some applicants have to answer as few as 18 questions, which takes less than 10 minutes to complete, according to the Department of Education. Some information is now directly taken from a filer’s tax return so that the applicant doesn’t have to hunt down numbers on old tax returns.The Department of Education estimates that 610,000 more students will qualify for a Pell grant on an annual basis. The Pell grant program is a key way the federal government helps students from low-income families go to college by providing eligible students with money they don’t have to pay back.And an estimated 1.5 million more students will be eligible for the maximum Pell grant amount, which typically changes each year. The Pell grant is worth up to $7,395 for the 2024-25 school year.This story has been updated with additional information."

        "title": "Fact check: Trump won’t stop inflating inflation numbers",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Americans have experienced significant price increases during the tenure of President Joe Biden – but prices have not gone up nearly as much as former President Donald Trump keeps saying.Trump, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has a years-old habit of using inaccurate figures even when accurate figures would serve his point. During his 2024 campaign, he has serially inflated the extent of inflation under Biden.Perhaps most notably, Trump has claimed this month that total Biden-era inflation has been more than double what it actually has been. And since last fall, Trump has also exaggerated about oil prices, gas prices, overall energy prices, bacon prices and general food and grocery prices.Total Biden-era inflationTrump said at a campaign rally in Georgia on March 9: “The fact is, under Biden, we have a three-year inflation rate of almost 50%.” Trump went even bigger in a CNBC interview on March 11, saying, “I believe we have a cumulative inflation of over 50%.”As The Washington Post noted last week, Trump’s claims aren’t close to true. Federal figures show that cumulative inflation from when Biden took office in January 2021 through February 2024 was 18.6% – not even half of what Trump said.Oil pricesAt his March 9 rally in Georgia and March 2 rallies in Virginia and North Carolina, Trump claimed that “the price of oil reached an all-time high” under Biden.“Not surprisingly, the claims are not true,” Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, told CNN. “Crude oil prices - the two benchmarks, WTI and Brent - hit their all-time highs in July 2008,” trading above $147 per barrel.While oil prices did spike under Biden in 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, exceeding $130 for West Texas Intermediate crude and $139 for Brent crude, they never reached record highs. And when Trump claimed in October speeches that “now it’s $100” and “we’re hitting $100 now,” both kinds of crude were below $90 - where they still were on Monday.Gas pricesTrump made false claims about gasoline prices under Biden in speech after speech last fall.For example, he said in a Florida speech in October that “today, you have $5, $6 and $7” per gallon. At the time, though, the state’s average price for a gallon of regular gas was about $3.42 per gallon and the national average was about $3.66 per gallon, AAA data showed – and precisely zero of the 8,237 Florida stations tracked by GasBuddy were selling gas for as much as $5 per gallon that day, let alone for $6 or $7.Trump deployed similarly inaccurate numbers while speaking in other states. You can read more here. The national average remains much lower today than the numbers Trump has cited; it was $3.47 per gallon on Monday, AAA reported.Energy pricesTrump claimed in a November speech in Florida that “we have the highest energy costs anywhere now.” Pavel Molchanov, a Raymond James energy analyst, said in an email to CNN at the time that Trump’s claim was not close to accurate. Citing data you can see here, Molchanov said, “U.S. electricity prices are lower than in practically every other industrialized economy.” US household prices for natural gas are also nowhere near the world’s highest.Bacon pricesIn multiple speeches in the fall, Trump claimed that bacon cost Americans “five times” what it did before Biden became president. That was wildly incorrect. Federal figures showed that the average price of a pound of sliced bacon was up by about 21.5% under Biden at the time Trump made these claims, not the 400% Trump said.Trump could not have known this at the time he made his comments, but the average price of bacon has steadily declined since the fall. The average in February 2024, $6.56 per pound, was about 12.5% higher than the $5.831 per pound average when Biden took office.Food and grocery pricesTrump claimed in a February 9 speech to the National Rifle Association that Biden can’t possibly get re-elected given “food that costs 40, 50, 60% more than it did just a few years ago.” At a March 16 rally in Ohio, he claimed that, under Biden, “groceries are up 30%.”As PolitiFact noted in February, federal figures showed that overall food prices were up 20.3% over the last three years at the time of Trump’s claim of a “40, 50, 60%” increase. No major category of foods was up even 40% over that time period, either. One item in particular, eggs, was up 72%, but Trump did not specify that he was talking about one specific product.At the time Trump claimed in Ohio on Saturday that grocery prices had increased 30% under Biden, average grocery prices had increased about 21% under Biden. The Republican Party used the correct figure in a social media post the next day."

        "title": "Joe Biden promised to ‘absorb’ 2 million asylum seekers ‘in a heartbeat’ in 2019 - he now faces an immigration crisis",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "During his 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden promised a stark departure from the immigration policies of the Trump administration.He pledged a 100-day moratorium on deportations after taking office. He promised to protect sanctuary cities from federal law enforcement agencies. And he harshly criticized the Trump administration’s treatment of undocumented immigrants at the southern border, asserting that America had the capacity to “absorb people” while calling on asylum seekers to “surge” to the border“We could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million,” Biden said at one event in August 2019. “The idea that a country of 330 million people cannot absorb people who are in desperate need and who are justifiably fleeing oppression is absolutely bizarre.”An estimated 3 million migrants who have been encountered at the southern border since Biden took office in January 2021 remain in the US, according to figures flagged by the Biden administration.But the mass influx of asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border has significantly strained US immigration resources. And turned into a significant political problem for President Biden—one that former President Donald Trump is seeking to capitalize on. In a recent CNN poll, Biden’s handling of immigration garnered his lowest approval rating, with only 30% of Americans expressing approval of how he was dealing with the border.That’s led Biden to dramatically change the way he talks about the situation at the border, shifting away from the more liberal immigration positions he espoused as a presidential contender and returning to more centrist views he held as a senator and vice president.Most recently, the White House shifted its rhetoric on sanctuary cities, urging the cities to comply with law enforcement agencies regarding migrants who’ve committed a crime. And Biden has embraced a now-stalled border bill that would have significantly tightened asylum laws and included a host of other conservative agenda items.“For too long, we all know the border’s been broken,” Biden said in January in support of the bill. “It’s long past time to fix it.”In many respects, Biden’s shift aligns closely with a more longstanding position on immigration throughout his political tenure. Over decades as a US senator and in his prior presidential bids, Biden maintained more centrist positions. It was primarily in reaction to the policies of the Trump administration that Biden began adopting notably progressive stances on immigration during the 2020 presidential campaign.In a statement to CNN, a White House spokesperson reiterated the administration’s call for congressional Republicans to support the bipartisan border bill.“Absent Congressional action and as we experience historic global migration, this Administration has led the largest expansion of lawful pathways in decades, worked with partners across the region to address irregular migration, and enforced our laws.”In a sign of how important immigration is as an issue in the 2024 election, both Biden and Trump held campaign appearances at the southern border last week, with Trump traveling to Eagle Pass and Biden about 300 miles away in Brownsville, Texas.Biden directly called on Trump to support the border bill and encourage Republicans to take it up on the floors of Congress.“So, here’s what I would say to Mr. Trump: Instead of playing politics with the issue, instead of telling members of Congress to block this legislation, join me. Or I’ll join you – in telling the congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill. We can do it together. You know and I know it’s the toughest, most efficient, most effective border security bill this country’s ever seen,” said Biden. “So instead of playing politics with the issue, why don’t we just get together and get it done.”President Biden is also widely expected to touch on immigration and the crisis at the border during his State of the Union address to Congress this evening.Biden’s rhetorical shift on immigration reflects a broader pivot among Democrats. Last week, Rep. Tom Suozzi was sworn in after winning a special election to replace ousted Republican Rep. George Santos in New York.Suozzi won in part by running on a platform that included cracking down at the border despite having boasted in 2022 about “kicking ICE out of Nassau County” as a county executive. But in his special election in 2024, he ran ads touting his support for Border Patrol and securing the border.At a Democratic debate in September 2019, Biden said as president he would do “several more things.”“I would in fact make sure that there is – we immediately surge to the border all those people are seeking asylum. They deserve to be heard. That’s who we are,” Biden said.“We’re a nation that says, ‘If you wanna flee and you’re fleeing oppression, you should come,’” he added.During his 2020 presidential campaign against Donald Trump, Biden was in a much different position as illegal border crossings were significantly lower than they are today.Much of Biden’s rhetoric at the time came in response to then-President Trump’s harsh rhetoric and policies related to the border. A year before he launched his campaign, in 2018, the Trump administration unveiled a “zero tolerance” policy on illegal immigration.Under Trump, the Justice Department announced it would pursue criminal charges against every adult crossing the border unlawfully. This led to the separation of numerous families, including those with infants as young as a few months old, as children couldn’t be detained alongside their parents in federal prisons.The policies faced widespread outcry and backlash and played significantly in that year’s Democratic primary. And Biden was contending with his own record on immigration – both as vice president and a senator – where he once supported significantly harsher policies and the country saw record deportations. Those policies drew flack from those running to his left in the party’s primary.“No great country can say it’s secure without being able to secure its borders,” Biden said during a campaign stop while running for president in 2007.In the run-up to and during that campaign in 2008, Biden spoke about jailing employers who hire “illegals,” said sanctuary cities shouldn’t be allowed to violate federal law and argued a fence was needed to stop “tons” of drugs coming into the country from “corrupt Mexico.”While Biden didn’t go as far as some of his opponents in that Democratic primary, in speeches and debates he vowed to reverse Trump’s asylum policies.“‘The fact is that, look, we should not be locking people up,” Biden said at a June 2019 Democratic primary debate. “We should be making sure we change the circumstance - as we did - why they would leave in the first place. And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe until they can be heard.”“Our Statue of Liberty, not very far from here says, invites us to welcome the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to be free,” he said in a speech in July 2019. “I’ll reverse Trump’s detrimental asylum policies.”Upon taking office, Biden issued executive orders ending construction on the border wall; reversed the so-called Muslim ban, which prohibited travel from several majority-Muslim countries; directed law enforcement agencies to narrow the pool of undocumented immigrants vulnerable to arrest, detention and removal; and raised the refugee resettlement ceiling to 125,000 people.The Biden administration also reversed the so-called “Remain in Mexico” program, which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases were reviewed by US immigration courts, and ended the Trump-instituted Title 42, the public health order that allowed for the quick expulsion of migrants without hearing their asylum claims, in the spring of 2023.After Title 42 ended, the government returned to its decades-old section of the US code, known as Title 8. The Biden administration then implemented new, stricter rules that bar asylum claims for migrants who passed through another country on their way to seeking asylum in the US; those who book their appointment online are exempt."

        "title": "Trump warned Pence certifying election results would be a ‘career killer,’ witness testified",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "On the morning of January 6, 2021, in a last-ditch bid to overturn his election loss, then-President Donald Trump told then-Vice President Mike Pence that his decision to uphold his constitutional duty and certify the results later that day would be “a political career killer,” according to a witness who overheard part of the call.The witness, a White House valet who was with Trump during most of that fateful day, described the phone call to the now-defunct House committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection. He could only recall Trump’s side of the conversation, but he recounted a direct threat delivered by the outgoing president to his own vice president.“Mike, this is a political career killer if you do this,” Trump said. “Do what’s right.”The transcript of the valet’s testimony, first obtained by the New York Times, wasn’t made public by the January 6 committee before they dissolved in early 2023, but House Republicans released it Friday. The valet was not identified by name.The call between Trump and Pence was their last contact before Trump delivered his incendiary speech at the Ellipse, where he told thousands of his most ardent supporters to march to the US Capitol and “fight like hell” to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election, during a joint session that Pence would be presiding over.The valet told lawmakers he didn’t hear what Trump was referring to when he told Pence that he shouldn’t “do this.” But the context makes clear that Trump was trying one last time to convince Pence to overturn the results by throwing out Democratic electors and seating Republican electors instead while presiding over the joint session.Before that call, Pence and his top advisers had repeatedly told Trump there was no legal basis to meddle in the electoral vote tally and that it would violate the Constitution. In a letter to lawmakers on January 6, Pence said what Trump wanted him to do would be “entirely antithetical” to “our Constitution, our laws, and our history.”“I do not believe that the Founders of our country intended to invest the Vice President with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the Joint Session of Congress, and no Vice President in American history has ever asserted such authority,” Pence wrote to lawmakers in his letter disavowing Trump’s theories.Trump’s threat to Pence proved true. Pence declared his candidacy for the 2024 GOP nomination in June but never gained traction with the Trump-loving Republican base. He dropped out in October and announced last week that he would not endorse Trump."

        "title": "Even in Haley’s backyard, there’s evidence of Trump’s GOP makeover",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Joy Rendulic was hesitant when her husband first suggested a move to South Carolina. Then she visited a small ice cream shop for sale near the spectacular coast of this barrier island town.Rendulic cashed in her 401(k) to buy it, and left Erie, Pennsylvania, behind.“God brought me here,” Rendulic told us during a break at Island Treats ice cream shop. “I thought I was doing what I was supposed to be doing for the rest of my life, and he had a different plan. We think we are in control. But we’re not.”The big move was in 2016. Nikki Haley was the governor then, and newcomer Rendulic was impressed.“Yes, she was a very good governor,” Rendulic said.Donald Trump won her vote for president that same year, again in 2020 and will once more when Trump and Haley square off in the South Carolina GOP presidential primary this month.“I totally believe that God has assigned him to this position,” Rendulic said of Trump. “That is my true belief.”We ask what happened in 2020.“That was a mess,” Rendulic said. “That was so illegal. Some improper cheating happening to the voting procedures.”We mention all the recounts and court cases Trump lost, including cases decided by judges Trump appointed, that upheld now-President Joe Biden’s victory.“I think so many people hate Trump,” she said. “I just know there was a whole lot of cheating.”There is no evidence of that, but Rendulic is adamant.So we ask, if it was God’s plan for Trump to be president, why would God let that happen?The answer is halting.“What happened is what happened. And I believe Trump is coming again.”Rendulic represents an important slice of the Trump base: for Trump no matter what. These voters echo his false claims about rigged elections and bogus investigations and they stand by Trump even when he does things counter to their priorities. You find a lot of them in South Carolina, one reason Trump consistently leads the primary polls despite Haley’s home state status.Rendulic, for example, lists abortion – or the “right to life,” as she puts it – as the reason her last vote for a Democrat for president was Jimmy Carter. But she offers no criticism of Trump when we point out he has recently criticized some state abortion restrictions as too harsh and has warned it could be a losing issue for Republicans.“I haven’t thought about that too much, probably,” Rendulic said. “I want it to be right to life.”No doubt Trump gets her vote.“He’s even more ready now and very, very intelligent, cares a lot about this country,” she said. “Wants to do what is right.”Billy Pierce is another piece of the Trump comeback puzzle.He has lived in Hartsville – about two hours inland from the South Carolina coast – all his 70 years except for a stint in the Navy.Pierce says he was drawn to Trump in 2016 for the same reason he backed Ross Perot in 1992.“I wanted a non-career politician in there that would do, would run it like a company,” Pierce said in an interview in the garage office where he organizes his part-time consulting work.Pierce sees Biden as too unwilling to stand up to the Democratic left and has fond memories of the pre-Covid economy during the Trump administration.“We didn’t have the high inflation,” he said. “We didn’t have the high interest rates.”Pierce is not an election denier. He does believe it was wrong that many states adopted new voting rules during the 2020 pandemic, but said Trump should have honored the results once all his challenges were exhausted.Nor is Pierce a fan of the former president’s toxic tone.“If he’d just shut up and, you know, got off Twitter and that kind of stuff, he’d have made a great president,” Pierce said.He called himself a likely Trump voter in the primary and described the choice between Trump and Haley as “the lesser of two evils.”But Pierce is very much in line with Trump on policy matters.“He’s going to fix the things I need him to fix,” Pierce said, listing the border as his top priority.“Shut it down,” is Pierce’s desire, though he agrees with Trump that congressional Republicans should not pass a border package before the November election – even if it would slow the flow of illegal border crossings. “This is a Democratic ploy” designed to help Biden, Pierce said.He offers a suggestion on what he would do at the border, based on his time in the military.“Have us put up razor wire,” Pierce said. “I have no problem with putting up two rows and mining the other. So if they come in, you tell them it is mined. You put signs out there that says it’s mined.”He balances such tough talk with a personal story about his daughter adopting two children from Guatemala. Be tough at the border now, Pierce said, and then conversations about more legal immigration would be possible. “It needs to be done the right way.”Craig Thomas lived in Tennessee when Trump caught his attention in 2016.Thomas describes himself as “conservative, some areas libertarian.”Trump, he thought then, was an outsider – and a vote for him would send a message to Washington.“It was like, alright, like this is good,” said Thomas. “Let’s blow some things up.”Now, Thomas lives in Charleston and is voting for Haley – to send a message to his two children.He is tired of all the personal attacks and all the anger and wants a president who is also a role model. Haley, he said, “brings very similar policy positions, but definitely without the drama.”One recent MAGA conspiracy theory hit too close to home.“I don’t think there’s any sort of a crazy conspiracy between the NFL and Taylor Swift and everything else just showing up for a Biden coronation,” Thomas said. “How do I look at my daughter, who is a huge Taylor Swift fan, and this guy just attacking Taylor Swift, just because she is going to support another candidate, right.”“And other things like that. And having those conversations with them. It does matter. And it does matter who you support.”Charleston is rich with both Revolutionary and Civil War history, a place where you can still ride a horse-drawn carriage down a cobblestone street. It is more affluent, more educated and less Trumpy than most of South Carolina.“But there is quite a bit of talk about Trump, even here,” Thomas said.Mark Sanford is out of politics because of that – because of the reach of the Trump Republican revolution.Sanford served in the House representing a Charleston-area district, and then was the state’s two-term Republican governor just before Haley was first elected in 2010. Sanford won his old House seat back in 2013, but then lost the Republican primary in 2018 because he was a sharp critic of then-President Trump’s fiscal policies, and sometimes of his tone.“I would say, ‘Well I’m for Trump in this area, but I’m against in these different areas.’ But people didn’t want nuance. They want: ‘Are you for or against him.’”Sanford wouldn’t directly answer when asked how he will vote in this month’s primary.But he did offer this: “I’ve never voted for Trump so far. I know that I’m not voting for him this time. I’ll let you read the tea leaves from that.”Sanford agrees when Haley goes after Trump for all the “chaos,” and especially when she highlights the deficit spending of the Trump years. Yet he expects a big Trump win in South Carolina, because the GOP electorate is so different now from when he was first elected.“What has traditionally worked in GOP politics isn’t so much working these days,” he said in an interview at his home in the Charleston suburb of Mount Pleasant. “He became sort of a proxy litmus test for ‘Are you for or against the system,’” Sanford said.“I’ve seen this erosion,” Sanford said. “Sort of Perot movement to Tea Party to Trump. It’s metastasized in ever aggressive forms. And what started out as a lot of well meaning Americans saying, ‘Look, we’ve got to do something about politicians doing what they said they were going to do’ (has evolved) into something much more strident. … It is their religion. I mean, I, I don’t know how else to explain it.”"

        "title": "Trump needs a half billion dollars, and fast",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Donald Trump’s three-day deadline to find nearly half a billion dollars or risk seeing his cherished property empire dismantled building by building is creating one of the most extraordinary twists ever seen in a US presidential election campaign.Trump’s new drama concerns his struggle to come up with a bond to cover $464 million plus interest charges so that he can appeal a civil fraud trial judgment against him, his adult sons and his company. If he can’t somehow find the money by Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James may begin seizing some of Trump’s assets to finance his obligation to the state. She has laid the groundwork with court filings that suggest Trump’s Seven Springs estate and golf course in Westchester County, New York, could be among her first targets.“The attorney general is ready to go. They are ready to go after his money to try to fulfill the judgment,” Adam Leitman Bailey, a real estate attorney who sued Trump seven times, told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “The question is how hard it is going to be to collect.”While this is primarily a crisis about Trump’s business and personal wealth, it is creating real political implications given his status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. No other candidate has ever faced such a distraction in the middle of an election campaign – and that’s separate from the former commander-in-chief’s parallel constellation of criminal cases that will dominate the run-up to Election Day and potentially add to the tumult of his second presidency if he beats President Joe Biden. And yet, Trump’s continued resilience as a candidate remains on display, as featured in two new CNN polls conducted by SSRS that were released on Friday, one of which shows the former president leading 50%-42% in Michigan and in a dead heat with Biden in Pennsylvania.Trump’s increasingly alarmed posts on social media on Thursday offered a window into his desperation. And they showed how every one of his cases now has a similar defense. He claims he’s not guilty of breaking the law but is the victim of endless political persecution. “ELECTION INTERFERENCE,” Trump for instance wrote on his Truth Social network. He complained that putting up money to permit an appeal was “VERY EXPENSIVE.” And he sent out a fundraising appeal to supporters titled “Keep your filthy hands off of Trump Tower!”On Friday morning, the former president wrote on Truth Social that he has “ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH.” Chris Kise, an attorney for Trump, later clarified that Trump was referring to “money reported on his campaign disclosure forms that he’s built up through years of owning and managing successful businesses,” not cash on hand.Even one of his legal cases would have been enough to drive any conventional candidate from the race long ago. But Trump leads many national and swing state polls, a sign that his attempts to spin his flurry of legal duress as persecution are working among many Republican voters. His standing in the race also reflects the daunting problems shadowing Biden’s reelection bid as the unpopular president tries to convince Americans that a recovering economy is healthier than they perceive in their daily lives given expensive trips to grocery stores and the high interest rates that make housing and other major purchases so daunting.While Trump’s enemies would relish his property portfolio being gutted by James, the political impact of such a humiliation would be uncertain. The resulting furor might add fuel to the ex-president’s claims he is being unfairly targeted by Democratic prosecutors because of who he is. One of his closest allies, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, is already trying to foster such an impression by slamming what she claimed was a “fundamentally un-American”campaign against him. At the same time, however, the latest controversy surrounding Trump may begin to remind moderate Republican and independent voters of the daily chaos that characterized his years in office. The Biden campaign has long maintained this will inevitably shift voters the president’s way, even if there is little evidence in the polls so far of that happening.The ex-president’s struggle to come up with funds, after multiple insurance firms declined to underwrite the bond, is a humiliating spectacle for a former president whose image as a masterful property magnate is central to his public brand. The frenzied search for money raises painful questions about the extent of Trump’s liquid wealth about which he has long boasted. It’s also an undignified plight for someone who could be occupying the White House in 10 months, and suggests troubling conflicts of interest if he turns to private donors — or overseas sources — to find the money in an 11th-hour dash for cash.The implications of the rush to finance the bond have caused panic in the ex-president’s inner circle, CNN’s Kaitlan Collins reported this week. But as grave as it is, the drama around the bond payment is only one of the multiple perils confronting Trump.— On Thursday, CNN reported that Fani Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, Georgia, plans to push hard for a trial before November’s election in a bid to thwart Trump’s delaying tactics – despite narrowly escaping being thrown off her election interference case following an intimate relationship with a fellow prosecutor. Given the complexity of the racketeering case, which includes an array of former Trump associates as co-defendants, any such timeline feels wildly optimistic. “I really think this is mostly just posturing by the DA’s office,” Michael Moore, a former US attorney, told CNN on Thursday. And while Willis wants a trial date soon, she is still not completely secure. The judge who allowed her to continue on the case despite rebuking her conduct, has granted the defendants the right to appeal his decision.— Elsewhere in Trump’s multi-city legal quagmire, Judge Arthur Engoron, who oversaw the New York civil fraud case that Trump lost, imposed new constraints on the the Trump Organization by expanding the reach of the monitor who is providing court-ordered oversight. The move means the firm will not for instance be able to move large amounts of money or take any significant business steps without scrutiny — a departure for a company that has always played by its own set of rules.— Also in New York, the Manhattan district attorney’s office called on a judge to impose no further delay in the trial over Trump’s payment of hush money to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election campaign. The trial had been set to start on Monday but was postponed after new documents surfaced and the former president is now asking for a 90-day delay. Judge Juan Merchan has postponed the case at least until April 15 and is due to hold a hearing on discovery issues on Monday that could also produce a firm trial date.— All of this is unfolding as other Trump trials — including federal prosecutions on election interference and the alleged mishandling of classified documents – are on hold as he tries to run out the clock ahead of November’s election with frenzied litigation and the filing of appeals. The Supreme Court is due to hear his sweeping claim of presidential immunity for acts committed in office next month and a ruling is not expected until late June. The decision could have important implications for the criminal cases that Trump is facing as he seeks a second term.— Yet, in one ray of light for the ex-president this week, his net worth could soon be set to soar with the merger of his media properties including the Truth Social network and Digital World Acquisition Corp., a blank-check firm. The move would make Trump by far the largest shareholder of the merged, publicly traded company and would on paper add billions of dollars to his net worth. In theory, this is the kind of windfall that could help Trump at a moment of extreme financial distress and at a moment when his campaign fundraising is falling well short of Biden’s. In practice, however, conditions of a deal mean that the ex-president could not liquidate his shares to ease his cash crunch immediately. And if he were to sell, the price of the company’s stock would likely tumble.State lawyers filed judgments in Westchester County, north of Manhattan, on March 6 – a week after Engoron’s civil fraud judgment finding that Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization had committed massive fraud, largely through overvaluations of property to secure favorable loans from banks and better rates from insurance companies.The former president’s lawyers disclosed this week that he had failed to find an insurance company to underwrite a bond that would guarantee the state’s financial stake in the case while the appeal process plays out. Trump has already filed a nearly $100 million bond in another case, after losing a defamation claim to the writer E. Jean Carroll, which he also plans to appeal.Trump’s attorneys have warned that any attempt to sell off properties to meet the judgment would cause him permanent financial damage since buyers would demand “fire sale” prices.”There’s also another reason why an attempt by James to seize his assets could be problematic for the ex-president — and is a far more complicated proposition for the attorney general than it might first appear.Some of Trump’s buildings and properties are sure to be financed by mortgages and other financial arrangements that will be difficult to unravel. In the event of a sale, the proceeds would go first to make good the lenders, meaning that a substantial chunk of the Trump empire may need to be sold off to reach the near half billion dollar figure owed to the state.One option that Trump might be forced to consider is bankruptcy — a route he has used several times in his flamboyant and checkered business career and that may allow him to dispose of assets in an organized way. But Collins reported this week that he has privately expressed opposition to that path, and it remains the least likely way out for now.Ultimately, the stigma of enduring such a process so close to a general election might be too much for the ex-president to bear. And it would add to concerns that the former president isn’t fit for a return to the Oval Office.Whatever the resolution, the multiple dramas again strike at the question at the heart of this election: Do Americans really want four more years of the mayhem, scandal and challenges to the law that rage around the former president week after week?"

        "title": "How Biden hopes to recapture voters scarred by inflation",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "As President Joe Biden barnstorms battleground states this week, he is framing the debate with former President Donald Trump around themes of economic populism that Democrats have employed, often with success, for decades. But Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, may prove to be a more elusive target for those arguments than a typical GOP candidate.Biden is portraying himself as committed to standing up for average Americans against powerful interests and the wealthy. But polls consistently show that significantly more Americans, including substantial numbers of Black and Hispanic voters, believe they personally benefited from Trump’s policies than Biden’s.That sentiment risks blunting Biden’s populist arguments: even if he can convince voters that Trump’s policies helped the rich and corporations the most, they may not mind as much if they believe that they also benefited more under Trump than they have under Biden.For Biden – who spent Tuesday meeting with Teamsters leaders and is headed to Wisconsin and Michigan the next two days – the critical question may be whether voters’ support for key ideas in his policy agenda can outweigh their frustration with their lived economic experience during his presidency. “You are really hitting on the crux of what a lot of swing votes will be [weighing] going into the election,” said Democratic pollster Danielle Deiseroth.Biden has plenty of ammunition to mount a traditional populist case against Trump. The former president’s principal legislative accomplishment was a massive tax cut that provided most of its direct benefits to corporations and the most affluent. Trump came within one Senate vote of repealing the Affordable Care Act, which has significantly increased health care coverage for lower-income working Americans. As a candidate in 2016, Trump pledged to seek legislative authority for Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices from pharmaceutical companies, but in office, under intense pressure from the industry, he abandoned that promise. Across a wide range of regulatory issues, from the environment to consumer protection, his administration consistently sided with business interests.Biden has set a very different course. He won the legislative authority for Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for seniors, and his administration is now negotiating lower prices for the first 10 drugs under that program; he also won authority to limit seniors’ monthly costs for insulin to $35 per month and to cap seniors’ annual out-of-pocket expenses for all drugs at $2,000. He passed significantly larger subsidies to help the uninsured buy coverage under the ACA, which has pushed enrollment to record highs. His administration has enforced the antitrust laws more aggressively than any in recent times and pursued a multi-pronged regulatory offensive against what he calls junk fees. The Covid-19 stimulus bill passed in 2021 included an expansion of the tax credit for families with children big enough to cut childhood poverty roughly in half, though the credit expired when West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin insisted on its removal in the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden did pass in that law a new 15% minimum tax for corporations.At the same time, the tax incentives for domestic clean energy manufacturing included in the Inflation Reduction Act and separate legislation promoting more domestic production of semiconductors, as well as the thousands of projects funded under the bipartisan infrastructure bill, have set off a boom in blue-collar employment with nearly 1.6 million jobs created in construction and manufacturing alone since Biden took office, according to administration figures. Biden also became the first president to walk a picket line when he joined the United Auto Workers during its strike against the nation’s three largest automakers.The new proposals Biden highlighted in his State of the Union last week and new federal budget released Monday also lean heavily into economic populism. “Overall, issues that economic populists have worked for years to put into the political mainstream got validated by President Biden,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Biden is proposing to raise the corporate tax rate, impose a 25% minimum tax on billionaires and end the Trump tax cuts for families earning over $400,000 per year (while retaining them for those making less). He wants to restore the expanded children’s tax credit, make permanent the larger subsidies for buying health insurance, provide a $10,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, establish a nationwide paid family leave program, and subsidize families’ child care expenses, partly by establishing universal access to preschool. He also called for increasing five-fold annually the number of drugs subject to Medicare negotiations, and to extend the caps on insulin and out-of-pocket drug costs to all Americans, not just seniors.Biden’s agenda, and the contrast it establishes with Trump’s policy priorities, gives Democrats plenty to work with in trying to portray themselves as champions of average families and Republicans as servants of the wealthy. “Our economic contrast is going to be that of Scranton, Pennsylvania, versus Park Avenue,” said Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign’s communications director. “We have the receipts because we are also running against a de facto incumbent. We saw what his economic policy looked like when he was in office and we have to clearly articulate that to people and remind people of what his priorities are.”The campaign, for instance, immediately denounced comments Trump made to CNBC Monday in which the former president signaled openness to cutting Medicare and Social Security. (Trump’s camp fired back by noting Biden also supported reductions in the programs to reduce the deficit at various points in his long Senate career.)But inflation, and its impact on the ability of working families to meet their bills, has greatly complicated Biden’s task in winning a conventional populist argument against Trump. Inflation has significantly moderated from its peak immediately after the Covid pandemic, but while prices are no longer increasing as fast, they remain about 18% higher than when Biden took office, and higher than that for such essentials as groceries, gas and rent. And while wages have been rising faster than prices since spring 2023, the cumulative increase in pay has not yet surpassed the cumulative increase in prices during Biden’s presidency, leaving many workers feeling squeezed. “What’s the disconnect between people’s experience and the [positive] economic movement that we’ve seen in the last four or five months?” asked Republican pollster Micah Roberts. “It’s three words: In-fla-tion. That’s it. It’s not a hard thing.”Pollsters in both parties say it is common in focus groups to hear participants say that they felt they had more money in their pocket at the end of the week when Trump was president. “Right before Covid, people were telling us it was the best economy they had seen in their lifetime,” said Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump. Now, he says, “They specifically blame Joe Biden for” their increased difficulty making ends meet. “Stand outside a grocery store,” McLaughlin added, “they’ll tell you how booming the economy is.”Polls leave little doubt Biden today is not only losing the economic comparison to Trump, but facing substantial skepticism among constituencies that usually are the principal target for a populist Democratic economic message. In a CNBC poll last October, not only did White voters say they were better off financially under Trump than Biden by a margin of more than 4-to-1, but so did non-white voters by a margin of nearly 2-to-1, according to figures provided by Roberts, whose firm conducts the survey with a Democratic partner. In the latest national NBC News poll, conducted by the same Republican-Democratic partnership, voters who identified as low-income and working-class trusted Trump over Biden on the economy by a crushing margin of 61% to 25%.Biden’s problems on the economy are especially acute with Hispanics. In a recent New York Times/Siena College poll, the Hispanic share of voters who said Trump’s policies had helped them personally was more than double the share who said that about Biden’s agenda. In the latest CBS News/YouGov national survey, the share of Hispanics who said the economy was excellent or good under Trump was 20 percentage points higher than the share who said the same about it under Biden. In 2020, Biden won about three-fifths of Hispanics, but in the CBS poll the share of Hispanics who said Trump fights for people like them virtually equaled the percentage that said Biden did. A majority of Hispanics, and even a plurality of Black voters, said Biden’s policies would cause inflation to rise, the survey found.Roberts said a major part of Biden’s problem on the economy is voters have such a concrete comparison available in their memories of the Trump record before the pandemic.“I think Trump’s messaging is really simple: we had a policy of creating domestic energy and becoming energy leaders; Biden on day one changed that and look what happened,” Roberts said. “We weren’t spending three trillion dollars on amorphous things that nobody can really put their fingers on. Biden did that, and look what happened to inflation. We had a policy that was strong on the border and immigration. On day one, Biden changed that and look what happened to our border – and by the way, that has economic impact. You can’t not make the contrast and comparison.”These negative retrospective assessments of the Biden and Trump economic records create huge headwinds for the president. His campaign, and Democrats more broadly, hope to overcome them primarily by stressing their prospective priorities for a second term. “This is not simply a retrospective comparison; this is also a comparison about the competing visions of the future,” Tyler said.Democrats point out that multiple polls show broad public support for almost all of the key agenda items Biden highlighted in the State of the Union and resistance to many Republican priorities, such as extending tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations or repealing the Affordable Care Act. “Voters—even past Biden voters who disapprove of his economic record—clearly reject what Trump and Republicans are offering,” Democratic pollster Margie Omero said in an email.In a report released last week, the Winning Jobs Narrative Project, a consortium of liberal advocacy groups, concluded that Democrats’ best chance to overcome voters’ continuing concerns about meeting their bills is to hammer home the populist case Biden sketched out in the State of the Union. By framing the election as a choice between “middle-out” versus “top down” and “trickle down” economics, “we think the president is absolutely on to something central to the direction Democrats should take in this election – which is who gets prioritized and how,” said Bobby Clark, a senior adviser to the group.After voters were exposed to Biden’s populist arguments, assessments of his economic record improved in the group’s polling, Clark said. But even after hearing that case, most voters in the group’s surveys still gave Biden negative marks for his economic performance, the study found.That finding may suggest the limits on how much Biden’s prospective agenda can offset voters’ discontent over their actual economic experience during his presidency. To win in November, most strategists in both parties agree, Biden doesn’t need to completely erase Trump’s advantage on the economy because so many voters resist the former president on other grounds, such as democracy, abortion rights, and the general chaos and conflict that he ignites.Still, Democrats would feel much better about the odds of those other concerns tipping the election in Biden’s favor if he can reduce his deficit on the economy to a more manageable level. To do that, Biden needs positive trends on the economy to persist – in particular, for wages to continue rising faster than prices, as they have since last spring.But he also needs to persuade enough voters that his agenda will do more than Trump’s to help them make ends meet in the future – even if they mostly believe the opposite has so far been true of Biden’s time in the White House."

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene files surprise motion to oust Speaker Johnson, a sign of growing revolt from the right",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia on Friday filed a motion to oust Mike Johnson from the speakership, according to sources familiar with the matter, amid anger about the government funding bill from the House Republican Conference’s right flank.The House would have to consider Greene’s motion within two legislative days after she is recognized. The chamber is heading for a two-week recess, and Greene told reporters she would not call up the resolution Friday, which means the clock to force a vote has not yet started.Greene’s motion is the most strident challenge to the Louisiana Republican’s leadership to date, and is a sign of a growing revolt from the right.The effort is a significant escalation of the inter-party divisions that have grown increasingly contentious since Johnson took over the speaker’s gavel last year following the historic ousting of Kevin McCarthy. Greene’s motion is the first official step toward launching that process again, a messy procedure that created a leadership vacuum and brought all House floor action to a standstill for weeks.Johnson controls one of the narrowest margins in House history and has had to rely on Democratic votes to advance some key legislation – including Friday’s government funding package – leading to bills that reflect bipartisan compromise, which conservative hardliners reject as too liberal.“I filed the motion to vacate today, but it’s more of a warning and a pink slip,” Greene said to reporters after filing the motion. “I respect our conference. I paid all my dues to my conference. I’m a member in good standing, and I do not wish to inflict pain on our conference and to throw the House into chaos.”GOP lawmakers who spoke with Greene told CNN that her plan is to use the two weeks of recess when the House is not in session to figure out when to bring the motion to vacate.Asked for a reaction by CNN, Johnson didn’t respond, dismissing the question with a wave.After Greene filed the motion, she was swarmed by her Republican colleagues. A source close to the conversations told CNN that a number of fellow GOP lawmakers were trying to convince the Georgia Republican not to bring the motion. Two of the lawmakers who were there, GOP Reps. Barry Loudermilk and Kat Cammack, were observed to be in an extended conversation with Greene.Shortly after Greene took the floor, GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin announced that he will step down in April, months before the end of his term, raising concerns that Greene’s motion and GOP infighting could cause Republicans — who will hold a mere one-vote majority in the House following Gallagher’s departure — to lose the chamber.New York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler, a moderate, told CNN that Greene’s effort is “idiotic” and “does not do anything to advance the conservative movement.”Lawler added that while he doesn’t believe the infighting will cost the GOP the majority, “idiotic stunts don’t help.” But GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma — a former House member who maintains close ties to his colleagues in the other chamber — warned that Republicans can lose the House due to Greene’s motion.“I think this causes real issues — real issues — for the incumbents and for our challengers out there, for the Republican Party if this goes through, because chaos in the House is 100% on us at this point, if this thing moves forward and they don’t have a speaker,” Mullin said.On the other hand, Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who chairs the Senate GOP’s campaign arm, said the threat to Johnson and the GOP’s slim majority “illustrates the point that the House needs to expand its majority” and will help turn out voters.“(T)he American people are going to say, with the chaos right now in the House, it’s very important that Speaker Johnson increases his majority in the House, and that the Senate is controlled by the Republican majority,” he told CNN.Meanwhile, Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville was sympathetic to Greene’s concerns.“We’re all disappointed with a lot of things that are in this bill. And I know she is, as conservative she is,” Tuberville said. He dismissed concerns that the infighting makes it appear that Republicans can’t govern, adding, “We are fighting for the American people.”Last fall, all Democrats voted alongside eight Republicans to oust McCarthy. But Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland signaled Friday that he would be open to helping Johnson if he was to take steps to put aid to Ukraine and Gaza on the floor.“I’m not invested in the particular career aspirations of particular Republican colleagues. That’s for them to sort out,” Raskin told CNN. “But I will make common cause with anybody who will stand up for the people of Ukraine, anybody who will get desperately needed humanitarian assistance to Gaza, and anybody who will work for a two state solution. I’m up for conversations with anybody.”This story and headline have been updated."

        "title": "What’s in the $1.2 trillion government funding package",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Congress released a massive $1.2 trillion bill on Thursday to fund the rest of the federal government.The package, which runs more than 1,000 pages, would provide funding for the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch. Lawmakers have until the end of Friday to approve the bill to avoid a partial government shutdown.The legislation would complete the funding of federal agencies through the fiscal year, which ends September 30. Congress earlier this month approved funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.House Republicans and Democrats each provided summaries of what’s in the bill.Homeland Security: The package would provide nearly $62 billion in total discretionary resources for Homeland Security, which was the most contentious of the appropriation bills that lawmakers were negotiating. It would include nearly $59 billion for non-defense programs and more than $3 billion for defense-related programs. The total figure excludes certain offsetting funds.US Customs and Border Protection would receive nearly $20 billion, an increase of $3 billion from the prior fiscal year. It would provide $495 million to bring the number of Border Patrol agents to 22,000, the highest number ever funded, and $20 million to hire an additional 150 officers to support counter-fentanyl efforts.It would bolster funding for processing capacity, medical care and the support of children’s well-being, but it does not provide money for a border wall. It increases funding for Transportation Security Administration personnel by more than $1 billion.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement would receive close to $10 billion. More than $721 million would be provided for transportation and removal operations of people who no longer have a legal basis to remain in the US or who pose a security or safety risk, nearly $292 million more than in President Joe Biden’s budget.It would increase the number of detention beds to 41,500, which is 7,500 more beds than funded in the prior fiscal year, as part of more than $3 billion for custody operations, the highest amount ever appropriated.The package would also boost funding for countering fentanyl and human smuggling investigations, non-intrusive inspection technology and staff to assist with the management and processing of those on the non-detained and detained dockets.US Citizenship and Immigration Services would receive $281 million, including $160 million for refugee processing, asylum and work authorization backlog reduction.The Federal Emergency Management Agency would receive more than $25 billion, nearly $73 million below the prior fiscal year.Defense: The bill would provide $824 billion for defense, an increase of nearly $27 billion from fiscal year 2023.It would hike basic military pay by 5.2%, the largest boost in more than 20 years. It would also beef up the basic allowance for housing by 5.4% and an allowance for meals by 1.7%. Plus, it would continue funding for suicide prevention and sexual assault programs.The package would provide $300 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative to aid the nation against Russian aggression. The funding is separate from a larger assistance package for Ukraine that is currently bogged down on Capitol Hill.It also would preserve the agency’s travel policy to allow service members and their families access to reproductive health care. And it would cut nearly $51 million from diversity and inclusion programs, rolling back support to fiscal year 2021 levels.The bill would also increase military funding for Taiwan to $300 million. The funds come from the State Department’s foreign military financing program. Last year, the US approved funding through this program for the first time for Taiwan. The program is typically only used for sovereign nations – a move that angered China, which claims the self-governing island as its own.State: The package would provide more than $58 billion for state, foreign operations and related programs, a decrease of more than $3 billion from the prior fiscal year.It would fully fund the US security commitment to Israel of more than $3 billion and prohibit taxpayer dollars from going to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, which supports Palestinian refugees and has come under fire after Israel alleged some of its staff were involved in Hamas’ October 7 attack. The bill would also eliminate funding for the United Nations Commission of Inquiry against Israel. And it would implement new conditions on any assistance to Gaza.It would funnel nearly $9 billion for international security assistance to allies and partners through international narcotics control and law enforcement activities, antiterrorism programs and peacekeeping operations, among other efforts.It would also provide nearly $9 billion in humanitarian assistance to various migration, refugee and international disaster programs.To address China’s activities in the Indo-Pacific region, the package would provide $300 million to Taiwan to support loans and loan guarantees, $400 million to the Countering the People’s Republic of China Influence Fund and nearly $2 billion “to help counter the growing influence of the PRC (China) in developing countries,” according to the House Democrats’ fact sheet.It would also direct $125 million to counter fentanyl and other synthetic drugs coming into the US from other countries for the first time.The package would invest $10 billion in global health initiatives, including the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, a﻿nd programs to improve maternal and child health and fight infectious disease. That would be nearly $531 million less than the prior fiscal year.And it would provide an additional 12,000 Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans that helped the US.Education: The bill would provide $79 billion for the Department of Education, which is $500 million less than the prior fiscal year. The amount is $22 billion more than House Republicans proposed, but $11 billion less than Biden’s budget request.Nearly $44 billion would be provided for K-12 education. About $18.4 billion – an increase of $20 million above fiscal year 2023 – would go to the Title I program, the largest federal funding source for K-12 schools.The package calls for nearly $25 billion for federal student aid programs, equal to fiscal year 2023. This keeps the maximum Pell grant, the government’s key aid program for low-income college students, at $7,395 per person. There is an increase in funding for historically Black colleges and universities, known as HBCUs; Hispanic serving institutions; and tribally controlled colleges and universities.There is no new money for the free community college initiative that Biden has proposed, according to a summary provided by House Republicans.Financial services and general government: The package includes $26 billion for financial services and general government, a decrease of $1 billion, or 4%, from the prior fiscal year.The Internal Revenue Service would receive $12 billion, the same as the prior fiscal year and $1 billion more than House Republicans had wanted to provide.The package would officially claw back about $20 billion of the $80 billion that was provided to the IRS by the Democrat-backed Inflation Reduction Act. The recission was agreed to by Democrats last year in a deal to address the debt ceiling and avoid a US default. These funds were meant to go to the IRS over a 10-year period and support efforts to modernize the agency and ramp up enforcement.Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over the IRS funding. Despite Democrat assurances that the IRS won’t increase enforcement on taxpayers making less than $400,0000 a year, Republicans claim that agency will use the money to hound middle-class taxpayers and small business owners.The legislation would provide $143 million for disaster relief efforts at the Small Business Administration, the same amount as last year. The judiciary would receive nearly $9 billion, an increase of $169 million over the prior fiscal year.The package would also provide $750 million for court security for justices, judges, their families and employees. It would also provide $55 million for election security grants for states to combat voter fraud, maintain voter rolls and improve the administration and security of federal elections.Labor: The package would provide nearly $14 billion for the Labor Department, which is $145 million below the prior fiscal year’s level. The amount is nearly $5 billion more than House Republicans proposed.It would provide more than $10 billion for the Employment and Training Administration, slightly lower than the prior fiscal year, and $1.9 billion for worker protection agencies, the same amount as in the last fiscal year’s package.Health and Human Services: The bill would provide more than $117 billion for HHS. That would be $14 billion more than House Republicans proposed, but $12 billion below Biden’s budget request.The Child Care and Development Block Grant, which provides child care assistance to low-income parents, would receive nearly $9 billion, an increase of $725 million from the last fiscal year. Head Start, which provides school readiness services to low-income families, would receive more than $12 billion, a boost of $275 million.The package would provide $4 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, an increase of $25 million from the prior fiscal year.The National Institutes of Health would receive close to $49 billion, an increase of $300 million from the prior fiscal year, excluding mandatory funding from the 21st Century Cures Act. The National Cancer Institute and research on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias would receive funding boosts.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would receive $9 billion, with small increases in funding for safe motherhood and infant health, as well as food safety.The package would also provide additional money for mental health and substance abuse programs and services.Congress: The bill would provide nearly $7 billion for the legislative branch, $150 million below the last fiscal year’s level. It would maintain support for an operating budget for congressional offices and would provide funding to pay interns.The United States Capitol Police would receive nearly $792 million, an increase of $57 million from the prior fiscal year. It would allow the force to hire up to 2,204 sworn officers and 636 civilian employees and continue efforts to beef up the physical security of the Capitol. It also calls for $2 million to provide security to lawmakers outside of the Capitol – including residential and district office security."

        "title": "Exclusive: Georgia DA plans to press ahead in effort to put Trump on trial before election",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Fani Willis, the embattled Fulton County District Attorney, plans to press ahead with her goal of putting Donald Trump on trial before the November election, and intends to ask the judge presiding over the Georgia criminal case to schedule a trial date as soon as this summer, according to three people familiar with her thinking.It’s a bold move considering the hurdles Willis faces in getting the case back on track after a two-month detour revealed embarrassing details of her personal life, damaging her credibility in the eyes of Judge Scott McAfee and leaving her politically vulnerable ahead of her own reelection bid in November.Willis narrowly avoided being disqualified over her romantic relationship with lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade, who resigned last Friday following a blistering rebuke from McAfee, publicly questioning both Wade and Willis’s decision-making. On Wednesday McAfee granted requests from Trump and his co-defendants to seek an appeal, meaning the threat of disqualification still hangs over Willis.Georgia Republicans continue to investigate allegations that Willis benefitted financially from her relationship with Wade. A state Senate committee could use its subpoena power to unearth new information and plans to meet several more times to hear from additional witnesses.Republican Gov. Brian Kemp last week signed changes into law that give a state commission the power to investigate Willis and authority to remove or sanction state prosecutors.Willis’s rock-solid political standing has also been shaken. This month, Democrat Christian Wise Smith, a former Fulton County prosecutor and Atlanta solicitor, launched a campaign challenging Willis in the May 21 primary. Republican lawyer Courtney Kramer, an attorney who worked in the Office of the White House Counsel under Trump, has also joined the race.And then there’s the Supreme Court’s looming decision on whether the former president enjoys absolute immunity from special counsel Jack Smith’s election subversion charges, one that could affect various criminal proceedings against Trump. Any ruling in favor of the former president from the high court could be a major blow to both criminal cases against Trump related to the 2020 election, including in Georgia. Hearings begin in April, with a decision expected by the end of June.Sources close to the Fulton County DA’s office say the uncertainty of the federal case does not prevent McAfee from setting a trial date. Fulton County prosecutors said in a recent email to defense attorneys they planned to respond to Trump’s immunity claim within two weeks of the Supreme Court’s decision, according to a source familiar with the correspondence.Prosecutors believe McAfee can put the immunity issue to the side until the Supreme Court rules while, in the interim, ensuring the Georgia case is as close to ready as possible if the justices decide Trump can be prosecuted, multiple sources familiar with the thinking inside Willis’s office tell CNN.Multiple sources close to Willis acknowledge the last two months have been a major distraction, one they admit was brought on by her own actions but also enabled, they argue, by how much leeway McAfee gave defense attorneys to attack Willis during the disqualification proceedings.“Basically, this is a two-month sideshow that the judge should have not even let happen,” one Willis ally told CNN. “But it’s over and the judge finally came to the right decision … and so now we’re back to where we never should have left, which is these people were under felony indictment. Let’s get a trial date.”Sources close to Willis tell CNN that the DA’s office is effectively ready to go to trial. Willis has said she needs only 30 days to prepare once a date is set. Defense attorneys have had since September to review the evidence and prepare their own arguments.Willis had previously asked for a trial to start in August 2024. Sources tell CNN she plans to re-up the request now that she has survived the chaotic two months – which saw the entire Fulton County DA’s office face disqualification and threatened to derail the entire case.It’s unclear exactly when Willis will make her second request of McAfee to set a trial date. The Fulton County District Attorney’s office has declined to comment to CNN for this story.Ashleigh Merchant, the defense attorney who led the effort to disqualify Willis, was asked by CNN’s Laura Coates on Wednesday night if the defense was trying to delay the trial until after the upcoming 2024 election.“I would very much like to go to trial,” Merchant said, adding that the defense has a right for a “fair and impartial” prosecutor to evaluate the case. “That didn’t happen in this case,” Merchant said.Willis and her team are aware of the political damage caused by the last two months but argue that their job is to prosecute the facts of the criminal case against Trump and his co-defendants, not worry about the political reverberations it causes.“There was definitely damage done,” said former Dekalb County District Attorney Robert James, who watches the case closely and told CNN that even if Willis can get the case to trial before November’s election, picking a jury alone could take months, especially with so many defendants involved.“Ultimately some of the prospective jurors that watched those hearings have formed negative opinions of the DA and this case,” said James. “It was always going to be difficult to get a fair and impartial jury. The hearing on the motion to disqualify just made it more difficult.”One source told CNN that Willis and her team realize the damage inflicted could diminish the public’s perception of the Georgia case ahead of what is likely to be a polarizing 2024 election. But that person also betrayed a sense of anger over the spectacle that was made of the televised hearings.“You have people covering this, frankly, like it was sports or politics,” the person said. “It deals with political activity, but there’s not an election going on in court. There are elections going on, but not in court.”Since his disqualification ruling, McAfee has indicated he is ready to continue moving forward, with sources familiar with the case saying he has asked attorneys on both sides about how to proceed with pre-trial motions.Recent communications from McAfee include questions about which motions needs oral argument and what needs more briefing before he can rule on them, one source told CNN.“He’s rolling up his sleeves,” one source said about McAfee.That’s not to discount the fallout from last week’s 23-page opinion from McAfee, which amounted to a highly-critical rebuke of Willis’s actions, describing her relationship with Wade being the result of “bad choices.”McAfee wrote that Willis’s comments at an Atlanta-area church in January about the case were “legally improper.”He also warned of the potential for a future gag order against Willis, but said her church comments were far enough removed from a jury trial that it would not “establish a permanent taint of the jury pool.”Michael Moore, a CNN legal analyst and former US attorney in Georgia, questions whether Willis should even remain on the case, and says if she does, she will need to show McAfee and the public that she is in complete “control.”“There is no question that the progress of the case has been impeded by unnecessary speed bumps and detours,” Moore said. “She simply cannot afford another unforced error that results in additional unfavorable comments questioning her candor or judgment.”"

        "text": "Sen. Joe Manchin, a critical swing vote in the closely divided Senate, said Wednesday that from now on, he will only vote to confirm nominees who have the support of at least one Republican senator.“I’m going to be very honest with everybody, if my Democratic colleagues and friends can’t get one Republican vote, don’t count on me. You can’t make it bipartisan, don’t count on me,” said the West Virginia Democrat who has announced his retirement that will begin in January 2025.“I’m not leaving this place unless I can practice what I preach and I’m preaching, basically bipartisanship,” he said. “This is my little way of doing it.”Manchin’s comments came in response to questions from CNN about President Joe Biden’s nominee for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Adeel Mangi, who would be the first Muslin-American on a federal appeals court. Many Republicans are vehemently opposed to him and accuse him having extreme views and part of a group they call antisemitic. Top Democrats strongly defend him and are pressing for a floor vote, after he was narrowly approved in the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, although they acknowledge not knowing if they have the votes to confirm him.On Thursday, Manchin confirmed he would vote against Mangi.One Democrat, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, announced her opposition to Mangi on Tuesday.Sen Lisa Murkowski, a centrist Republican from Alaska who often votes across the aisle, told CNN Wednesday she needs to examine Mangi’s record before deciding how she will vote.For Manchin, he said Wednesday there is one exception to his newly announced requirement of bipartisanship: “That’s my requirement unless they’re bats*** crazy. If they’re bats*** crazy left, I’m gonna vote against them anyway. If they’re halfway decent, they’ll get at least one Republican to vote for them.”Asked if he still sees a viable path for Mangi to be confirmed, Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said, “it certainly is going to be a challenge with the many things people are saying,” referring to vocal opposition to Mangi.This story has been updated with additional developments.CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to show that Mangi’s nomination is to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals."

        "text": "Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey announced Thursday he will not run for reelection in the Democratic primary for his US Senate seat, but left open the possibility that he could run as an independent candidate.“I will not file for the Democratic primary this June. I am hopeful that my exoneration will take place this summer and allow me to pursue my candidacy as an independent Democrat in the general election,” Menendez, who is facing bribery and obstruction of justice charges, said in a video posted online.The news comes as Menendez had faced calls to resign, including from a number of his Senate Democratic colleagues, as a result of the charges.Menendez was up for reelection this year and would have faced a highly competitive Democratic primary had he entered the race. Tammy Murphy, the wife of New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and the state’s first lady, is running. Rep. Andy Kim of New Jersey is also running and has been endorsed by Sen. John Fetterman of neighboring Pennsylvania, who has been the most vocal Senate Democrat calling for Menendez to resign.Menendez is facing bribery charges for allegedly taking steps to benefit the governments of Egypt and Qatar and help several New Jersey businessmen and receiving in exchange gold bars, cash, a luxury car and Formula One Grand Prix race tickets. Menendez has forcefully denied the charges against him and has said that he will prove his innocence while claiming that he is being persecuted by prosecutors.Menendez pleaded not guilty last year to a charge alleging he conspired to act as a foreign agent of Egypt. In January, federal prosecutors alleged in a superseding indictment that Menendez accepted gifts from Qatar as part of a yearslong corruption scheme, with the Gulf nation joining Egypt as another foreign country the New Jersey Democrat is accused of helping while in office.Menendez stepped down as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last year when he was initially charged but has rejected calls to resign from his US Senate seat.Menendez has criticized colleagues who have called for his resignation in the wake of the indictments, and has said in a floor speech that, “They would deny me due process and undermine the fundamental principle of our law, that in America, you are innocent until proven otherwise. by a jury of your peers.”In November 2023, Menendez defended attending a classified briefing on Ukraine, insisting he had a right to get the classified information as he pushed back on the charges against him.“I’m a United States senator, I have my security credentials, and an accusation is just that. It’s not proof of anything,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju at the time.Menendez has served in the Senate since 2006 – and this is not the first time he has faced a legal battle.Menendez was charged by federal prosecutors in 2015 with conspiracy, bribery and honest services fraud relating to allegedly abusing the power of his office.At the time, prosecutors said the senator accepted more than $600,000 in political contributions, a luxurious hotel suite at the Park Hyatt in Paris, and free rides on a private jet from a wealthy ophthalmologist, Dr. Salomon Melgen, in exchange for political favors.This story has been updated with additional developments."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "A balloon recovered off the coast of Alaska had been in the ocean for “well over a year,” the Pentagon said Friday.The balloon was discovered floating in the ocean by commercial fisherman in late-February. The fishermen shared photos of the suspicious object with law enforcement, who were concerned it could be another Chinese spy balloon similar to the one that flew across the United States last year before it was shot down.The origin of the balloon found off Alaska remains unclear, and the fact it had been in the water so long means it could have floated for hundreds of miles or more before it was finally found three weeks ago.Some of the balloon debris, which had been held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, has been transferred to other facilities for further evaluation and analysis, Pentagon spokeswoman Sue Gough said in a statement.“Some material has been transferred to U.S. government facilities for further examination and analysis,” Gough said. Gough was unable to provide more information on where the ongoing analysis would take place.The US assessed that the spy balloon shot down last year was part of an extensive surveillance program run by the Chinese military, as CNN reported at the time. The balloon fleet, according to US officials, had conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.China appeared to suspend the program following the episode, and it’s not clear whether it has been restarted. Taiwan in January accused Beijing of flying multiple balloons through its airspace."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin will resign from Congress early, handing another blow to Speaker Mike Johnson and his razor thin Republican majority.In a statement, Gallagher confirmed he will resign effective April 19.Gallagher did not include a reason for stepping down but said he came to the decision after “conversations with my family.”The House already has three vacancies – left by two Republicans and one Democrat – and Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado has said he will leave Congress after this week.Once Buck and Gallagher leave, Johnson will be down to a 217-to-213 majority, meaning Republicans will only be able to lose one vote with full attendance and still be able to pass legislation.NBC News first reported the news of Gallagher’s decision.Gallagher is chairman of the high-profile Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and Gallagher noted the hunt for a new chair once he departs in his announcement.“I’ve worked closely with House Republican leadership on this timeline and look forward to seeing Speaker Johnson appoint a new chair to carry out the important mission of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party,” Gallagher said in his statement.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise downplayed the tightening majority.“It is tough with a five-seat majority, it is tough with a two-seat, one will be the same,” Scalise told CNN. “We all have to work together.”“We have to unite if we are going to get things done, we have proven with bills like our energy bill, our border security bill and some of the other big things we have done we can come together and get things done for hard working families,” he added.The announcement comes on a tumultuous day for the House GOP conference. The House voted to pass legislation to fund the government through the rest of the fiscal year, a compromise with Democrats that angered the right flank of the party. A majority of House Republicans voted against the Johnson-backed funding legislation, and GOP Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene took procedural steps to oust the speaker, a move the Georgia congresswoman described as “a warning.”The House started a two-week recess around the Easter holiday Friday, meaning Gallagher will only have a handful of legislative days before he leaves Congress.This story has been updated with additional developments."

        "title": "Fact check: Trump falsely claims he isn’t allowed to appeal fraud ruling until he puts up big money",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Former President Donald Trump made a series of false claims on Tuesday while railing against the judge who issued the $454 million civil fraud judgment against him.Trump posted the claims on social media the day after his lawyers said in a court filing that he had been unable to persuade any company to provide the appeal bond he needs in order to stop New York Attorney General Letitia James, who filed the successful lawsuit against him, from beginning to collect on Judge Arthur Engoron’s judgment.Trump baselessly accused Engoron and James of corruption and wrote that they are “asking me to put up massive amounts of money before I am allowed to appeal the ridiculous decision. Never done before.” He also claimed that Engoron “wants me to put up Hundreds of Millions of Dollars for the Right to Appeal his ridiculous decision” and that “Engoron wants me to put up the ridiculous fine (I DID NOTHING WRONG!) before I get a chance to Appeal his crazed ruling - A first!”Trump claimed in another post: “I shouldn’t have to put up any money, being forced by the Corrupt Judge and AG, until the end of the appeal. That’s the way system works!”Facts First: Trump’s claims are comprehensively untrue. He is allowed to appeal Engoron’s decision without putting up any money. In fact, he is already appealing; he filed his notice of appeal in February, the first business day after Engoron made the ruling official. And what Trump is actually being required to do – put up cash or a bond for the full amount of the judgment to secure a stay that would prevent James from collecting during the appeals process – is not “a first” or something “never done before.” The requirement is set out by New York law, and it is regularly applied in civil cases in the state.“This is literally the way that the NY rules of court are designed to work, and actually work every day,” said Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who is now a litigator in private practice in New York. He said the rules being applied to Trump “are applied every day in New York courts, on verdicts of all sizes,” though the size of the judgment against Trump is notably large.Epner added: “Donald Trump is either horribly misinformed or lying.”Given that Trump appealed Engoron’s ruling before putting up any money, it is obvious that Engoron hasn’t made the right to appeal dependent on putting up a large amount of money. “He’s allowed to appeal regardless… he’s already appealing,” said Neil Pedersen, president of a surety bond agency in New York.James gave Trump a 30-day grace period before she starts to collect on the judgment. It ends on Monday, March 25, meaning that this date is a de facto deadline for Trump to find the cash or a bond unless a New York appeals court panel agrees to his request to allow him to avoid putting up the money until the end of the appeals process – which could be years from now. (The appeals court could alternately allow Trump to put up a smaller amount of money.)If Trump did not secure a stay, James collected on the judgment, and then Trump eventually won the case on appeal, James would be required to return any collected money to Trump along with interest, Epner said."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The joint fundraising agreement that Donald Trump has inked with the Republican National Committee and state parties first sends donors’ money to his campaign committee and then to the leadership PAC that pays his legal bills before the national party gets its share, an invitation to an upcoming fundraiser shows.The invite to a high-dollar event in Palm Beach, Florida, next month shows Trump’s campaign receiving the first $6,600 in donations – the maximum amount that a candidate can receive from an individual donor for the primary and general campaign. The next $5,000 goes to Save America, which has paid tens of millions of dollars in legal bills for the former president and his allies in recent years.The RNC, which has faced a cash crunch heading into the election year, is third in line for contributions and is slated to receive the next $413,000, according to the invitation to the April 6 “Inaugural Leadership Dinner,”which has attracted an array of wealthy Republicans.The fundraising arrangement increases the odds of donors’ money continuing to help underwrite Trump’s mounting legal expenses.Trump’s campaign spokesman Steven Cheung defended the arrangement, saying the PAC also “covers a very active and robust post-Presidency office and other various expenses” not related to Trump’s legal issues, which he characterized as “illegal witch-hunts.”“The Trump campaign, the RNC, and state GOP parties ultimately receive the overwhelming majority of funds raised through the Trump 47 Committee,” he added, saying that less than 1% of an individual donor’s maximum contribution would benefit Save America.Save America, the leadership PAC that Trump has used as the main vehicle for paying his mounting legal bills, has spent more than $72.5 million on legal expenses since January 1, 2021, federal election records show.In February alone, Save America plowed nearly $5.6 million into legal costs, largely related to Trump and his allies, surpassing the money the committee took in last month. And his expenses are expected to grow as trial dates approach.Trump faces 88 criminal charges across four indictments and a looming deadline to fulfill a half-a-billion-dollar civil fraud judgment in New York.The Associated Press first reported on the sequence of donations. Earlier this week, CNN reported about the fundraiser and that Save America was slated to get a $5,000 share of the money raised at the Florida event.The maximum an individual can donate to the joint fundraising committee – $814,600 per person – is the top ticket price for the April dinner. Perks for contributors at that level include dining at Trump’s table, according to the invitation.Although Trump is the GOP’s presumptive presidential nominee, he can raise funds designated for the primary until he is formally nominated at his party’s convention."

        "title": "Biden’s cash edge widens, Trump’s lawyer fees pile up and other takeaways from latest filings",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Donald Trump’s campaign saw an uptick in donations in February but failed to match the accelerating fundraising pace set by Joe Biden, whose political operation widened its already substantial financial advantage over his Republican rival as it entered March and the general election showdown, new filings show.The February financial reports filed Wednesday night also underscore the continued steep price of Trump’s legal troubles: Legal bills alone outstripped the money Trump’s leadership PAC took in last month.Meanwhile, Robert Kennedy Jr. – whose independent White House bid is facing increasing scrutiny and criticism from Democrats – is racking up big bills as an allied super PAC spent heavily to help him break through to voters and gain access to the ballot in more states.Here are some key takeaways from new campaign filings for the month of February:The new filings, which cover only a portion of the committees associated with each presidential contender, continue to show Biden’s early fundraising dominance.The president ended February with $71 million in available cash in his principal campaign account – more than twice the $33.5 million in cash reserves held by Trump’s campaign. Biden expanded the gap seen at the end of January when his campaign had nearly $56 million in available funds to Trump’s roughly $30.5 million.The filings also show that the Democratic National Committee ended February with more than twice the cash on hand as its Republican counterpart, buttressing Democrats’ financial edge over a political operation that Trump is working to build with the national GOP now that he is the party’s presumptive nominee.Some groups affiliated with the presidential contenders will not disclose their balance sheets to federal regulators until next month, but totals released by the two candidates’ campaigns highlight the disparity between them at the end of February.Trump’s campaign and joint fundraising committee together brought in $20.3 million in February and entered this month with a combined $41.9 million cash on hand, a Trump campaign official told CNN.Those amounts trail far behind the $53 million that Biden and Democrats previously announced raising in February and the massive $155 million in available cash that the president’s team said it had amassed with its affiliated committees.In the face of his campaign fundraising crunch, Trump has taken a more hands-on approach to donors, including meeting with contributors at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. The former president is slated to headline a high-ticket fundraiser next month in Palm Beach, where top contributors can have dinner at his table, among other perks, according to an invitation obtained by CNN.Wednesday’s filings also underscore the financial strain of Trump’s continued legal woes.The Save America leadership PAC – which Trump has used as a vehicle to help underwrite lawyers’ fees incurred by him and allies – spent nearly $5.6 million on legal bills in February.Those expenses exceeded the Save America’s total receipts, most of which came in the form of a $5 million refund that the PAC received from a Trump-aligned super PAC, MAGA Inc. In all, Save America has clawed back more than $52 million from the super PAC, diverting resources from an account intended to help support Trump’s presidential bid to pay off his mounting legal bills.Save America is on track to soon exhaust the $60 million in refunds it previously requested from MAGA Inc.Trump faces 88 criminal charges in four jurisdictions and also is scrambling to secure a half-a-billion-dollar bond to appeal his civil fraud judgment in New York.A joint fundraising agreement that Trump’s campaign recently inked with the national and state Republican parties will set aside of share of the money it collects to benefit Save America, a potential way to boost the leadership PAC’s dwindling balance.MAGA Inc., the Trump-aligned super PAC, took in $12.7 million in February – boosted by a $5 million contribution from Nevada-based hotelier and space entrepreneur Robert Bigelow.Bigelow – who previously supported the campaign of onetime Trump rival Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – is among several wealthy Republican donors slated to attend a high-dollar fundraiser next month to benefit Trump and the Republican Party.Other Trump super PAC contributors last month included former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler and businessman James Liautaud.A super PAC aligned with Kennedy boosted its spending in February, pouring resources into advertising and ballot-access efforts, the new reports show.American Values 2024, the lead super PAC supporting Kennedy’s campaign, reported spending nearly $8.8 million last month, a dramatic increase over the $1.4 million it had spent in January. The biggest expense in February: more than $6 million to CBS for a high-profile and controversial Super Bowl ad that repurposed a spot from the 1960 presidential campaign of the candidate’s late uncle.The group also reported spending about $950,000 on ballot access endeavors as Kennedy seeks a place on presidential candidate rosters in the fall.American Values 2024 reported raising $4.2 million last month, with $4 million coming from megadonor ally Gavin de Becker.De Becker, a private security company executive, previously donated $10 million to the super PAC and has been refunded $9.65 million – in an unusual arrangement that super PAC officials have previously described as “bridge funding.”Super PAC officials did not immediately respond to a CNN inquiry Wednesday about the $4 million donation in February from de Becker. His firm also has been a top vendor to Kennedy’s campaign.Earlier this month, the DNC filed a complaint against the super PAC, alleging the group had failed to properly disclose de Becker’s activity as loans and loan repayments. American Values 2024 did not report refunding any more contributions in February.Meanwhile, Kennedy’s principal campaign committee raised $3.2 million and spent nearly $2.9 million last month. It entered March with about $5.1 million in cash on hand and had more than $1.3 million in debts to de Becker’s firm for security services and travel costs."

        "title": "Senate passes government funding legislation, averting a partial shutdown",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The Senate passed a government funding package early Saturday morning, averting a partial shutdown and ending a lengthy fight that has loomed over both sides of Capitol Hill for months.The legislation will next be sent to President Joe Biden to be signed into law, which he’s expected to do Saturday.The vote marks a major moment on Capitol Hill as it brings to a close an annual appropriations process that has dragged on far longer than is typical – an effort that has been punctuated by partisan policy disagreements and a historic change of leadership in the House after conservatives ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in an unprecedented vote last year.While final passage came after the midnight deadline, the Senate’s action effectively prevented any lapse in funding or government function, and the federal government is now funded through the end of the fiscal year.The Senate’s vote comes after the end of a tumultuous day on Capitol Hill, highlighting how narrow the majorities are in both chambers are and how high tensions are running among lawmakers. Immediately after the House voted to pass the legislation the Senate is considering, firebrand Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed a motion to oust Johnson from the speakership. While the resolution does not need to be addressed immediately, it represents the most formal and strident challenge to the speaker’s leadership since he took over in late last year. The final House vote was 286-134, with 112 Republicans and 22 Democrats voting against.Despite the House voting earlier in the day Friday, voting in the Senate was delayed for hours amid negotiations over an agreement to speed passage in the chamber. Republicans had demanded votes on controversial amendments that put some vulnerable Senate Democrats in tough political spots.The funding bill addresses a slate of critical government operations, including the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.Lawmakers unveiled the $1.2 trillion government funding package just before 3 a.m. ET on Thursday, and the text is more than 1,000 pages long.Schumer said Thursday that the text for the legislative package came “in the nick of time,” with fewer than 48 hours out from the deadline for a partial government shutdown. The Democratic leader added, “Now Congress must now race to pass this package before government funding runs out this Friday. Once the House acts, the Senate will need bipartisan cooperation to pass it before Friday’s deadline and avoid a shutdown,” a reference to how any one senator could slow passage of the bill and launch a partial shutdown.After months of averting shutdowns at the eleventh hour with stopgap bills, Congress finally passed a package of six bills in early March to fund a slate of government agencies for the rest of the fiscal year.Johnson, who won the gavel after McCarthy’s ouster, faces an extremely narrow majority and pushback from his right flank over his handling of the government funding fight. With the House starting a two-week recess on Friday, Greene’s resolution to oust Johnson will hang over the GOP conference as it considers what to do next in the 118th Congress.Johnson praised the bill early Thursday morning, outlining conservative wins in the package.“This FY24 appropriations legislation is a serious commitment to strengthening our national defense by moving the Pentagon toward a focus on its core mission while expanding support for our brave men and women who serve in uniform,” Johnson said in a statement.House members on both sides of the aisle lashed out Thursday over the agreement, with progressives and far-right members criticizing the legislation for different reasons.GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN he won’t be supporting any Republican who votes for the bill and that leadership “owns the bill,” describing the bill as a “failure.”“I would have a very difficult time doing that,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. “The Republican conference is a failure if they pass this bill.”House progressives have also been critical with some indicating they will vote against it over provisions that will withhold funding to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees for one year amid the alleged involvement of UNRWA employees in the October 7 attack against Israel.McCarthy’s fate has raised questions over whether Johnson could face a similar threat to his speakership, but many Republicans have made clear they do not want another speaker’s race after the intense infighting and chaos triggered by McCarthy’s removal.The separate six-bill funding package, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden earlier this month, included funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.This story and headline have been updated to reflect additional developments."

        "title": "CNN polls take voters’ pulse in two states that flipped blue in 2020",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania – two states that flipped from red to blue in the 2020 presidential election – begin this year’s general election campaign more dissatisfied than pleased with the candidates they have to choose from, with a fairly small but crucial share saying they are open to changing their minds on the race, according to new CNN polling conducted by SSRS.The surveys of registered voters find a dead-even race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in Pennsylvania (46% each), with Trump ahead in Michigan (50% Trump to 42% Biden). Both polls were fielded after Trump and Biden each clinched enough delegates to win their party’s nomination for president, according to CNN’s estimates.The polls suggest that in this rematch with Trump, Biden’s winning 2020 coalition may now be more intact in Pennsylvania than in Michigan. The Pennsylvania poll finds Biden leading among women, voters of color, college graduates and independents, and running about even with Trump among voters younger than 35. In Michigan, though, women split about evenly, Biden’s margin among voters of color is narrower and he trails Trump by significant margins among independents and young voters. In both states, Biden holds on to about 9 in 10 of his self-described 2020 supporters, while Trump keeps slightly more of his own 2020 voters.Sizing up their choices in the rematch between Biden and Trump, most voters in both states say they’ve already decided, but about a quarter in each state say they could change their minds between now and the election. That’s more than enough to swing the eventual outcome in these two pivotal states, both of which Biden won by slim margins in 2020.There’s even more room for movement among a few key subgroups: In Michigan, 45% of independents and 41% of voters younger than 35 say they’re less than solidly decided, and it’s 32% of independents and 34% of younger voters in Pennsylvania.Fewer than half of voters in either state say they are satisfied with their choices in the presidential race (47% in Pennsylvania, 46% in Michigan). In Michigan, satisfaction has dropped since a fall survey was conducted as former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s now-suspended campaign for the GOP nomination gained traction, but before any nominating contests were held (53% were satisfied in that survey). That decline is steepest among independents (from 46% satisfied in the fall poll to 29% satisfied now), with a smaller dip among Republicans (from 71% to 65%).Majorities of voters in both states say that a second Trump term would bring fundamental changes to the US, while only about a quarter say the same about a second Biden term. Biden’s own supporters are less likely than Trump’s backers to say a second Biden term would bring fundamental change, while both Biden and Trump supporters say a second Trump term would bring dramatic shifts to the country. In both states, more see the change Trump might bring as a good thing than a bad one. For Biden, just over 4 in 10 in each state say a second term would not bring much change at all, and those who do see change split a bit more evenly over whether it’s for good or for ill.In both states, the race is shaping up more as a referendum on the former president than on the current one. Majorities of Trump’s supporters in both places say their vote is largely to express support for him rather than opposition to Biden, while Biden’s backers say they are motivated more by opposition to Trump.And despite Biden’s underwater approval ratings in both states (just 40% of voters in Pennsylvania approve of his performance and only 35% in Michigan), he hangs on to the support of double-digit shares of those who disapprove of his work as president (12% who disapprove in Pennsylvania support him in a matchup with Trump, as do 13% in Michigan). In 2020, according to exit polling, Trump won just 2% of those who disapproved of his performance as president in each of these states and turned out to vote.A hypothetical four-way matchup including Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Cornel West in addition to Trump and Biden suggests significant support for Kennedy in both states. In Pennsylvania, 40% choose Trump, 38% Biden, 16% Kennedy and 4% West, while in Michigan, it stands at 40% Trump, 34% Biden, 18% Kennedy and 4% West. In both states, fewer than one-fifth of those backing candidates other than Biden or Trump say they are enthusiastic about their choice, with about half in each state saying they back their candidate mostly because they don’t like their other options.Both Biden and Trump are viewed unfavorably by majorities of Michigan and Pennsylvania voters, and about 1 in 6 in each state are so-called “double-haters,” holding an unfavorable view of both Biden and Trump (17% in Michigan, 18% in Pennsylvania). In the hypothetical matchup including third party candidates, a plurality of these double-negative voters in each state break for Kennedy, despite large shares of that group also saying they don’t know enough about him to have an opinion.Most voters say they expect that Biden and Trump will still be their party’s nominees by the time the presidential election happens (55% say that’s extremely likely in Michigan, 60% in Pennsylvania). About two-thirds of Biden supporters say it’s extremely likely in both states, while 56% of Trump backers in PA and 49% in Michigan feel the same.Asked to assess how well each candidate aligns with their expectations on policy positions, empathy, temperament and sharpness and stamina, registered voters in each state are similarly negative about Biden’s and Trump’s policies and ability to understand the problems of people like them. Biden scores particularly poorly on sharpness and stamina, and Trump sees his worst numbers on temperament. Roughly two-thirds in each state say Biden’s sharpness and stamina is not what they want to see in a president (69% in Michigan, 64% in Pennsylvania), and broad majorities, 61% in both states, say Trump’s temperament is not what they want in a president.About half of Pennsylvania voters and 44% in Michigan say that, if true, the charges Trump faces related to attempts to overturn the 2020 election disqualify him from serving as president, outpacing the roughly 4 in 10 in each state who see the charges as not relevant to his ability to serve, with the rest saying they cast doubts on his fitness for the job but are not disqualifying.Trump’s false post-2020 claims that the election outcome was rigged against him have raised broad doubts among his supporters about the validity of the election process this cycle. More than 7 in 10 Trump supporters in each state say they believe the false claim that Biden did not legitimately win enough votes to become president in 2020. And looking ahead, Biden’s supporters in both states are about 60 points more likely than Trump backers to say they are very confident that the votes in this year’s presidential election will be accurately cast and counted.About 4 in 10 voters in both states call the economy their top issue as they consider their choice for president, while protecting democracy, with about a quarter naming it, rates second. Immigration and abortion are also cited by more than 10% of voters in each state. Protecting democracy is the top issue for Biden voters in both states, while for Trump’s voters, it’s the economy by a wide margin. More than 20% of women who back Biden in both states say abortion and reproductive rights is their top issue, significantly higher than for other voters.Asked which of the two major candidates would do a better job handling several top issues, voters prefer Trump over Biden by wide margins in both states on the economy, immigration and the situation in Israel and Gaza. Trump holds a somewhat narrower edge over Biden on handling the US role in world affairs. Biden tops Trump by a wide margin in both states as better able to handle abortion policies, and he is more trusted than Trump in Pennsylvania on handling democracy in the US. Voters in Michigan, however, split about evenly between the two on that issue.The two states each have Democratic-held US Senate seats on their ballot this fall. Democrats’ narrow majority in the chamber means the GOP could win control of the Senate with as little as one flipped seat, depending on the outcome of the presidential contest. Voters in both states diverge on whether a GOP takeover of the Senate would be good or bad for the country: 45% of Michigan voters say the country would be better off if Republicans win control of the Senate in November, 35% say the country would be worse off and 20% no difference, while in Pennsylvania, it’s 42% worse off, 38% better off and 19% no difference.In Pennsylvania, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, who is running for reelection, is largely seen positively (33% favorable, 25% unfavorable, 42% no opinion), while his top GOP opponent, David McCormick, remains largely unknown (13% favorable, 17% unfavorable, 70% no opinion).In Michigan, neither of the major candidates for what will be an open seat – Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow announced her retirement last year – are particularly well-known, nor are their most prominent challengers. Majorities say they don’t have any opinion of Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin or former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers, and those who do have an opinion are largely divided on whether it’s positive or negative. Actor Hill Harper, who is running for the Democratic nod, is even less recognized than Slotkin (about 86% have no opinion). On the GOP side, former Rep. Peter Meijer has similar name recognition to Rogers, but former Rep. Justin Amash, who became an independent before leaving the House but is running for the GOP nomination, is broadly unknown (83% have no opinion of him).These CNN polls were conducted online and by telephone by SSRS from March 13 to 18. In Michigan, a random sample of 1,097 registered voters was surveyed, and in Pennsylvania, it was a random sample of 1,132 registered voters. Results for the full sample in Michigan have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points; it is 3.8 points for results in Pennsylvania.This headline has been updated."

        "category": "politics",
        "text": "President Joe Biden announced another round of student loan debt forgiveness Thursday, totaling $5.8 billion for nearly 78,000 public-sector workers, and will be sending congratulatory emails to those borrowers next week.Additionally, 380,000 borrowers who may be eligible for debt relief within the next one or two years will also be getting emails from Biden with a message that says “keep it up!”“If you continue your career in public service, you’re on track to get your eligible student loans forgiven in less than two years through Public Service Loan Forgiveness,” an example email provided by the White House reads.Under the forgiveness program, known as PSLF, qualifying borrowers – like teachers, social workers, some nurses and doctors, and government lawyers – are eligible for student debt cancellation after making 10 years of monthly payments.The emails come as the Biden administration is eager to remind voters in an election year about how it has approved more student debt cancellation than under any other president – despite the fact that the Supreme Court knocked down its broad student loan forgiveness program last year.That program would have canceled up to $20,000 for low- and middle-income borrowers, for an estimated total of $430 billion of debt relief.Instead, the Biden administration has canceled a total of $144 billion of federal student loan debt for nearly 4 million borrowers to date, mostly through existing student loan forgiveness programs that target specific groups of borrowers.Biden started sending emails to borrowers who are getting student loan forgiveness last month when it announced a round of debt relief worth about $1.2 billion. Borrowers who received debt forgiveness previously may not have gotten an email from Biden.PSLF was created by Congress in 2007 but was plagued with administrative problems before Biden took office. Just 7,000 people had ever received debt relief under the program previously, according to the White House.In 2021, Biden put a temporary waiver in place, expanding eligibility so that some borrowers could retroactively receive credit for past payments that did not otherwise qualify for PSLF.The Biden administration is also conducting a one-time recount of borrowers’ past payments to fix what officials have called “past administrative failures.” The agency expects to complete the recount by July.Generally, the recount will give borrowers credit toward forgiveness for any months in which they made payments regardless of what repayment plan they were enrolled in at the time, according to the Department of Education. The recount especially helps borrowers who may have been inappropriately steered by their student loan servicing company into a long-term forbearance, a period in which they stopped making payments.What Biden has been doing – before and after the Supreme Court ruling – is using existing student loan forgiveness programs to deliver relief to certain groups of borrowers.The borrower defense to repayment program delivers relief to borrowers who were defrauded by their college, for example. The Biden administration also made discharges automatic for borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled.Additionally, nearly 153,000 borrowers have been granted student loan forgiveness so far under Biden’s new income-driven repayment program known as SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education). Under that plan, remaining federal student loan balances are erased for those who originally borrowed $12,000 or less and have made payments for at least 10 years.None of these programs expire, meaning they will help qualifying borrowers now and in the future."

        "title": "Lawmakers unveil $1.2 trillion government funding package ahead of shutdown deadline",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "Lawmakers unveiled a $1.2 trillion government funding package on Thursday, setting up a high-stakes sprint to pass the legislation as a shutdown deadline looms at the end of the week.It’s not yet clear if lawmakers will be able to pass the legislation ahead of Friday’s deadline, raising concerns on Capitol Hill that there could be a short-term lapse in government funding over the weekend.With the release of the legislative text that’s more than 1,000 pages, the House and Senate are now facing a major time crunch to get the legislation across the finish line. A number of critical government operations need to be funded by the end of the day on Friday, March 22, including the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.Shortly after the bill was released, Speaker Mike Johnson released a statement and said the legislation is “a serious commitment to strengthening our national defense by moving the Pentagon toward a focus on its core mission while expanding support for our brave men and women who serve in uniform.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that the text “comes in the nick of time,” fewer than 48 hours out from the deadline for a partial government shutdown.“This funding agreement between the White House and Congressional leaders is good news that comes in the nick of time,” he said Thursday. “When passed, it will extinguish any more shutdown threats for the rest of the fiscal year, it will avoid the scythe of budget sequestration and it will keep the government open without cuts or poison pill riders.”“It’s now the job of the House Republican leadership to move this package ASAP,” Schumer added.Top lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed the desire to avoid a partial shutdown, but there are challenges ahead.Before the text was released, Johnson said Wednesday it is his “hope” the House will be able to pass the legislation to avert a lapse in funding by the Friday midnight deadline.Johnson has so far been non-committal as to whether House GOP leaders would adhere to a rule intended to give members 72 hours to review bill text before a vote.The Louisiana Republican faces an extremely narrow GOP majority and pushback from his right flank over his handling of the government funding fight.Top House Republicans expect they’ll have the votes to pass the spending package Friday – but it could be close. They’ll need a two-thirds majority to pass the bill, so Democrats will have to help carry it amid a revolt in some quarters of the House GOP Conference, according to senior GOP sources.It remains unclear if the GOP can win a majority of their conference – a key threshold they try to achieve on every vote.In a bad sign for leadership, GOP. Rep. Robert Aderholt, the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations subcommittee chair, announced Thursday that he would not support the spending package on the floor, citing concerns over border and abortion measures.In the Senate, agreement will be needed from all 100 senators to swiftly pass the legislation – and the objection of any one senator could derail a quick vote and delay the process.Earlier this week, Schumer warned that it will be a “tight squeeze” to pass the funding package before the deadline.“As soon as the bill passes the House I will put it on the Senate floor,” Schumer said Wednesday. “It’s no secret that it’s going to be a tight squeeze to get these funding bills passed before the weekend deadline. So I ask all of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, House and Senate, to be flexible and prepared so we can finish the appropriations process.”The package provides $19.6 billion for Customs and Border Protection, a $3.2 billion increase above fiscal year 2023, and includes $495 million for additional Border Patrol agents, which the Biden administration has repeatedly called for. It does not add funding for the border wall.The package also provides almost $90 billion in discretionary funding to the Department of Homeland Security, bolstering funding for additional resources. It funds 41,500 detention beds, which is more than the previous fiscal year and Biden’s request, according to the GOP summary. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement had recently drafted plans to wind down detention space, and as a result, release migrants, to cover their budget shortfall.The bill also increases Department of Defense funding, providing $824.3 billion, an increase of $26.8 billion above fiscal year 2023.It also provides an additional 12,000 special immigrant visas for Afghans who helped the US.The bill struck down poison pills that would have decreased the salaries of members of the administration including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other officials to $1, and blocked funds for diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across the defense and intelligence communities, and banned the flying of the Pride flag.It also kills an amendment that would have cut funding for Head Start by $750 million, and instead increases funding by $1 billion above 2023 funding levels for Child Care and Head Start.The current fiscal year began more than five months ago on October 1, 2023. Lawmakers have faced a series of fiscal cliffs since then as a result of funding deadlines created by short-term extensions.Earlier this month, finally passed funding for the rest of the fiscal year when it passed a separate six-bill funding package signed into law by President Joe Biden, which included funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.Now, Congress is finally on the verge of completing the annual appropriations package as long as it can pass this latest slate of government funding bills.If a temporary lapse in federal funding were to occur, it would likely have only a limited impact on government operations if funding were to be restored before the end of the weekend.This story has been updated with additional details."

        "title": "Blinken urged Qatar to threaten Hamas with expulsion from Doha as Gaza ceasefire talks stalled, officials say",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered a stern message to Qatar earlier this month: Tell Hamas that they must deliver on a hostage and ceasefire deal that would halt the war in Gaza or risk getting kicked out of the Qatari capital of Doha where senior members of the terror group are based, two US officials told CNN.The pressure from the US came at a time when negotiations between Hamas and Israel had stalled, before Hamas came back to the table with a new set of demands which were discussed this week in Doha. The indirect talks, held between Israel and Hamas under Qatari and Egyptian mediation, were the first to be held in Doha at that level in weeks and are set to resume on Friday.The message was delivered by Blinken to Qatar’s Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani in a meeting in Washington on March 5, sources familiar with the matter said. US officials said that Qatar, which has been a critical partner to the US in efforts to reach a ceasefire deal, understood the message and received it without major pushback.Qatari officials did not comment on the specific meeting but said that they are exerting immense pressure on Hamas. It is unclear if Qatar delivered the warning to Hamas leaders.Hamas established a political office in Doha in 2012, with senior members of the group based there permanently. As a result, Qatar plays a crucial role in the region between Hamas and other nations.While Blinken’s message this month was tough, the Biden administration has been actively discussing with Qatar its relationship with Hamas since the terror group carried out its brutal attack on Israel on October 7.A week after the October 7 attack, Blinken met with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani in Doha and publicly said “there can be no more business as usual” with Hamas.During that meeting, the Emir suggested that the country would be willing to expel Hamas leaders from Doha if they were asked to do so by the US, according to sources familiar with the meeting. But the Emir also told Blinken that Hamas was willing to turn over some hostages and Blinken agreed that it would be good to pursue the opportunity to get out the hostages, which kicked off the entire negotiating process, separate sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.The talks have gone on for months and brought about a temporary pause in fighting and a limited hostage release in November.The message from Blinken earlier this month was prompted by US frustrations over the slow pace of progress in the negotiations, US officials said.“I would have liked to have seen it done even earlier. I can’t be sure that it wasn’t done, but their behavior suggests to me that they weren’t feeling pressure from us over there,” said Dennis Ross, a former US envoy to the Middle East. “My guess is early on, there was a difference in assessment from the administration, they thought – they would get more responsiveness by not putting pressure on that [Hamas]. I think as time went on, they’ve become somewhat more frustrated.”While some US officials noted that it is unclear exactly how much leverage Hamas’s political wing Doha has over the group’s militant faction in Gaza, they also pointed to forward movement this week with the parties finally meeting again in Doha.Blinken struck an optimistic tone this week, saying on Wednesday that the negotiations are “getting closer” to a deal.“I think the gaps are narrowing, and I think an agreement is very much possible,” Blinken said."

        "title": "Prosecuting parents and suing social media, gun manufacturers in a new era of mass shooting accountability",
        "category": "politics",
        "text": "The search for accountability in the unending era of American mass shootings is turning to novel legal tactics against the parents who raise shooters, the gun manufacturers that appeal to them and the social media platforms where they might learn radical behavior.Suing gun manufacturers. This week, Everytown Law and the city of Chicago, making use of a new firearm responsibility law in Illinois, filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer Glock arguing that Glock is helping spread illegal machine guns. They argue that Glock is responsible because its handguns can easily be refashioned into automatic weapons using a so-called “Glock switch,” even though it is not manufactured by the company.RELATED: CNN Investigates filed this report in 2022 about a device that can turn a semi-automatic weapon into a machine gun.Prosecuting parents. Twin guilty verdicts for the parents of Ethan Crumbley suggest juries are willing to look beyond a mass shooter in placing blame. Crumbley is the Michigan teen who in 2021 killed four fellow students the same day that his mother and father were warned by a counselor about his behavior.The facts in that case may have been particularly damning in terms of how they implicated the parents for negligence. But the precedent could be used by prosecutors in cases that do not make national headlines.“We’re living in a new world now, and that new world is a prosecutor saying, ‘If we’re not going to have legislation, if we’re not going to have significant protections, we’re going to take it upon ourselves to use the law in a way that gets accountability to everyone and anyone who could have potentially been involved,’” CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson told CNN’s Erin Burnett last week.Karen McDonald, the Oakland County prosecutor who oversaw the Crumbley parent prosecutions, told CNN’s Jean Casarez she did not know when she brought the charges that the case would be the first of its kind, but she was always intent on finding a way to prosecute the parents.“I said, we have to find that – but I know it exists, because I know that our set of laws are based on what’s right and wrong. And I know that we have a duty to other children and other people to protect them,” McDonald said.The facts were particularly bad for the parents in this case, according to Stephen Gutowski, a CNN analyst and founder of The Reload, a website the covers the gun rights and safety debate.“I think that the success of it by itself is going to encourage more prosecutors to try this,” Gutowski told me by phone. He also pointed me to one argument complicating the prosecutions in this case: that Ethan Crumbley faced charges as an adult, but his parents faced charges as parents. But that distinction may not matter to many people who want justice for the four killed students.While prosecutors are inventing new avenues of prosecution based on old laws, activist groups led by Everytown for Gun Safety have launched a wave of new lawsuits around the country.These civil cases are being filed in spite of a 2005 federal law that gives gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits “resulting from the misuse of their products by others.”Supporters say they have crafted the lawsuits to respect that law while still seeking accountability. They were buoyed by the $73 million settlement in 2022 of a lawsuit brought by the families of children and adults killed in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School against the bankrupt gun manufacturer Remington and its insurers. The suit argued that Remington contributed to the killing with its marketing strategy.The fact that the US Supreme Court allowed the lawsuit to proceed suggests the immunity of manufacturers is not ironclad. A bonus for gun safety activists is the message the settlement sends to insurers and bankers behind manufacturers.Now, Everytown is partnering with victims and survivors across the country.“Our view of gun violence in the country requires accountability at multiple levels,” Nick Suplina, Everytown’s senior vice president for law and policy, told me in a phone call.In his view, that includes the need for accountability from lawmakers who refuse to pass new gun laws and lobbyists who fight them. “Recently, we’ve really expanded the need to hold others accountable for their role in gun violence in the country,” Suplina said, adding that Everytown now has expanded its effort to bring lawsuits.► Social media companies – In Buffalo, New York, where a racist gunman killed 10 people at a grocery store in 2022, lawsuits on behalf of victims’ families and survivors target social media companies.A judge ruled this week that the lawsuits can proceed, setting up a challenge to the portion of US telecom law known as “Section 230,” by which social media companies have enjoyed immunity from responsibility for what’s posted on their sites.The suits claim social media companies – like Meta, Alphabet, Reddit and 4chan – ”profit from the racist, antisemitic, and violent material displayed on their platforms to maximize user engagement,” including the time then 18-year-old Payton Gendron spent on their platforms viewing that material.The suits also target the manufacturer of a gun lock, a gun store and the manufacturer of body armor used by Gendron.► Gun manufacturers – In Uvalde, Texas, lawsuits allege that firearm manufacturer Daniel Defense is partially responsible for the deadly shooting at Robb Elementary School in 2022 because the company’s marketing targeted young, disaffected men and encouraged them to use weapons in a military fashion.The lawsuits also target the gun store that sold the murder weapon and the officers who failed to enter the elementary school as the shooting occurred.► Gun shops - The lawsuit against a gun shop that supplied a shooter who killed five coworkers in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2023, alleges the gun store “upsold” the shooter, directing him toward deadlier gear.It remains to be seen if these lawsuits will build on the success of the Sandy Hook families’ settlement with Remington.“They’ve adopted this tactic, but it hasn’t so far born out into success,” Gutowski said.There’s no lack of trying.California has passed multiple gun-related laws that have a mixed record so far in court.Giving people the ability to sue manufacturers of “abnormally dangerous” firearms has so far been blocked. An effort to ban guns in most public places is currently blocked. Restrictions that prohibit defendants awaiting trial from possessing guns have been allowed to proceed.The law has not kept up with low-tech, after-market ways to alter or even build so-called “ghost guns” with kits bought online and assembled at home. The Biden administration had sought to regulate ghost guns, but those efforts were declared unlawful by a federal appeals court. The administration last month asked the Supreme Court to weigh in.Meanwhile, a Michigan teen is suing a major ghost gun kit seller after he was accidentally shot in 2021 by a friend who had bought the kit despite being under age.The Supreme Court is already considering the action taken by former President Donald Trump, and continued by President Joe Biden, to ban “bump stocks,” another after-market product that makes rifles more deadly. Conservative justices were skeptical of the bump stocks ban in oral arguments last month.This headline and story have been updated."

        "title": "Everyone wants the latest chips. That’s causing a huge headache for the world’s biggest supplier",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Until just a few years ago, the world’s largest chipmaker had a simple answer to training new recruits — a buddy system that paired them up with senior engineers tasked with showing them the ropes.All that changed three years ago, when a global chip shortage and rising geopolitical tension turbocharged growth at TSMC. It needed to create an intensive training program to get tens of thousands of new recruits to work quickly.TSMC set up the Newcomer Training Center inside a sprawling science park in the city of Taichung in central Taiwan in 2021. That facility now holds the key to the company’s global expansion.In a world dominated by Moore’s Law — the idea that the number of transistors on microchips would double every two years — speed is of the essence for TSMC and its customers, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD). It also matters for US President Joe Biden, who is counting on the company to boost US manufacturing in Arizona.Today, all new engineers based in Taiwan and some overseas hires are required to spend eight weeks at the center, which CNN visited recently.“[Now], we can teach the newcomers more systematically. We can make them learn faster and build a solid foundation,” said Marcus Chen, an instructor at the center. “It’s a TSMC core value [that] we have to do everything very efficiently.”The center is modeled on the operations of a fabrication plant, called fabs, where chips are made.In one room, a rotating robotic arm cleans and polishes a semiconductor wafer by pressing it on a pad, in a process known as chemical-mechanical polishing. In another, a machine lifts a pack of wafers to the ceiling and moves it around the facility.The engineers trained at the center won’t just be deployed across TSMC’s fabs in Taiwan. Some will be used to “seed” its facilities globally.“Every new fab, at the very beginning, we need to bring a certain percentage of people from Taiwan,” Lora Ho, the company’s senior vice president of human resources, told CNN. “After many years, what we want to do is to gradually reduce assignees [and] increase the local hires.”Sometimes called the most important company in the world, TSMC (officially Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) produces an estimated 90% of the world’s super-advanced semiconductor chips, which are used to power everything from smartphones to artificial intelligence applications.To meet rising demand and facing pressure to be physically closer to its customers, TSMC is building new fabs in the United States, Japan and Germany. Its existing plants are in Taiwan as well as in eastern China and Washington state.Last month, the chip giant opened its first fab in the Japanese city of Kumamoto and is set to open two $40 billion facilities in Phoenix, Arizona in the coming years to make smaller, more advanced chips. It has committed to investing $3.8 billion to build a fab in Dresden, Germany, the company’s first in Europe.The soaring demand, particularly for chips that power AI, has created a shortage of talent for the semiconductor industry. TSMC said last year that one of its fabs in Arizona would be delayed because of a lack of specialist workers.“Finding the best talent has always been an issue but it has become even more so since the world suddenly woke up in the past few years and realized semiconductors were important,” said Stewart Randall, head of electronics and embedded software at Intralink, a consultancy.“Expanding fab numbers [and] capacity of fabs is connected to geopolitics but also market demand,” he added. “This means we need more people with IC (integrated circuits or semiconductor) design, IC manufacturing, materials science skills. Countries compete for this talent.”TSMC’s Ho said a shortage of talent is one of the main challenges the company faces.“There’s a scarcity of talent worldwide,” she said. “If we move globally, then we really need to expand our talent pool.”TSMC currently has about 77,000 employees around the world. In a few years, the number will reach 100,000, Ho added.A lack of qualified workers isn’t the only problem. TSMC has also faced challenges in adapting to differences in work culture between Asian and Western countries.While its engineers in Taiwan are paid extremely well, the job is demanding with long hours and weekend shifts. And, if an earthquake were to hit the island — a common occurrence — engineers are expected to return to their stations immediately, regardless of the time of day.Kristy Hsu, director of the Taiwan ASEAN Studies Center at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research, said that while Taiwanese employees may be accustomed to overtime and being on-call, other workers may not.“For chip fabrication, and also testing and packaging, it’s a very labor-intensive industry, and therefore, people have … to work overtime,” she said. “Also, you have to always be prepared to be called [in], whether it’s during Chinese New Year or Christmas.”“That working culture has been [in] Taiwan and some other East Asian countries like Japan for generations,” she added. “When you talk about this kind of work culture in the US and Germany, it’s going to be more problematic.”Ho said as TSMC expands globally, it is learning how it should manage teams differently and efficiently from various parts of the world.“We do need to adjust to the local practice and become socially acceptable. Certain things you can do here, but you cannot do there,” she said. “The way we manage in Taiwan cannot be totally transferred [to other countries]. In the US, we have to adjust to local culture.”“People here [in Taiwan] are willing to follow the instruction. But I think in the US, you have to explain why — in the language that they’re familiar with,” she added.The chip giant’s move to diversify its production beyond Taiwan has rattled the nerves of some locals, including lawmakers, who worry that it could eventually diminish the island’s importance as a global semiconductor powerhouse.Ho played down those concerns.“I don’t think it will take away [Taiwan’s] strengths because we are still very highly concentrated in Taiwan, and the most leading-edge technology will absolutely start from Taiwan,” she said. “It’s not taking away, but it will expand Taiwan’s exposure and we can learn how to operate globally.”— CNN’s Juliana Liu contributed reporting."

        "title": "Apple customers love Apple. The Biden administration thinks they could do better",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The Justice Department’s lawsuit against Apple wants to break the company’s notoriously tight grip on the iPhone, the device that’s made it one of the biggest and most profitable companies on the planet.But regardless of what happens in court, the case is already shining a light on the two faces of Apple: the cool, high-end tech brand that customers adore; and the ruthless, unavoidable behemoth that developers loathe.Here’s the deal: The Feds say Apple is maintaining a monopoly that stifles competition, deprives consumers of choice and ultimately forces them to pay more.Apple’s response to the allegations is, more or less, a) no we don’t, and b) good luck proving customer harm when everybody loves us.And that’s where this Goliath versus Goliath battle gets interesting.Customers really like Apple. We love the phones, the watches, the laptops and the AirPods that ensure we never have to be alone with our thoughts (unless, heaven help you, you forgot to charge them). Heck, I’m typing this article on an Apple keyboard connected to a MacBook connected to iCloud, and I would throw a fit if I had to switch to a PC.Apple even nodded to this in its widely circulated statement to the media Thursday:“We innovate every day to make technology people love – designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users.”Magical!The company added: “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”And it’s true — the gods saw fit to get Steve Jobs and Jony Ive (the revered product designer behind Apple’s biggest hits) in the same room at the same time, and the world was never the same.Their products married good design and good software. They were never cheap, but they were shiny, user-friendly, simply beautiful. With help from the best marketing team in Silicon Valley history, Apple became a tech icon with a billion devotees.But on the business side, Apple is not so beloved.The company has a reputation for quashing competition and squeezing developers with exorbitant fees. Many smaller tech companies hate Apple as much as they live in fear of its lawyers.“Apple has this practice of seeing what others innovate for the phone, copying it, and then making it so that those others can’t compete,” Adam Wolfson, an antitrust lawyer with the firm Quinn Emanuel, told me. (There’s even an industry term for when Apple appropriates a third party’s tech, called “Sherlocking” — a nod to one of Apple’s search products that rendered its non-Apple rival, Watson, redundant.)“They very much have an approach to being about as sharp-elbowed as you can possibly get,” said Wolfson, who has represented clients in Apple disputes. “Apple is extraordinarily litigious, and will fight to the very last breath, because it can.”The DOJ lawsuit argues Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by blocking innovative new apps and services.If you’re an iPhone user and you’ve ever been in a text thread with someone using an Android device, you know the green-bubble problem and how annoying it is. It’s not as if Apple can’t make that experience better, according to the DOJ — it just doesn’t want to, because it’s better for Apple if its users see Android as a social faux pas. It’s tech tribalism, and Apple is a master at cultivating loyalty.The green bubble issue is just one of several ways Apple is abusing its dominant position, according to the lawsuit. (My colleague David Goldman has more on that here.)If it succeeds, the Justice Department could force Apple to loosen some of the restrictions it has placed on its “walled garden” approach, which Apple says is meant to create a seamless experience for users and keep them relatively safe from viruses.That is a concern for investors, says Gene Muster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, because the lawsuit goes after “the juiciest part of their business.”But Muster doesn’t expect the lawsuit to be a body blow for the company, and believes “people will still gravitate to Apple products.”Indeed, customer satisfaction is, paradoxically, a tricky issue for the DOJ as well. People are pretty content with their iPhones. Could we be more content with more competition? Maybe. The DOJ will have their work cut out for them trying to prove it.Ultimately, Wolfson said, “the law wants to make sure that consumers are getting the absolute best, not just what Apple decides we want.”"

        "title": "Birkin bags are too hard to buy, shoppers allege in antitrust lawsuit",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Birkin handbags are some of the priciest, most exclusive bags in the world. Hermès produces a limited number of Birkins and they can sell for around $450,000. And just having the money often isn’t enough.A new lawsuit brought by two customers in California who were unable to buy Birkin bags alleges Hermès is a monopoly, and they say the way the company sells Birkins is a violation of antitrust law.The customers say they were told that before they would be allowed to purchase a Birkin bag, they first needed to purchase other Hermès items and accessories. They claim that Hermès has dominant power in the market for its Birkin handbags, thus making it illegal for the company to link handbag sales to customers purchasing other products like shoes, scarves or belts.“Consumers are coerced into purchasing ancillary products from [Hermès]” to buy a Birkin bag, the complaint alleges. “This is anticompetitive, tying conduct.”US law forbids monopolies from using forced buying — or “tie-in” sales — to gain sales in other markets where it is not dominant and to make it more difficult for rivals to compete.The lawsuit alleges that Hermès “tying arrangements” have allowed the company to increase the price of Birkin bags and the profits the company has made from Birkins.Hermès, which is based in Paris, did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment on the lawsuit. Its website claims that each Birkin is created, start to finish, by one craftsman.Antitrust lawyers say the lawsuit against Hermès will be difficult to prove. But even if it fails, it could be damaging to the company’s image.Birkin bags are a symbol of rarefied wealth.Getting a Birkin handbag, which can sell from $10,000 at retail to record premiums of $450,000 at auction, directly from its maker is a difficult feat — one often achieved through celebrity status or at least a spending history with Hermès. The brand produces only a limited quantity for sale each year and the bags are not sold online.“Typically, only those consumers who are deemed worthy of purchasing a Birkin handbag will be shown a Birkin handbag,” the complaint alleges. “For all practical purposes, there is no way to order a bag in the style, size, color, leather, and hardware that a consumer wants.”A 2022 report from Credit Suisse and Deloitte said that Birkin sales spiked 38% in 2020, as luxury collectibles soared in value during the Covid-19 pandemic, and resellers reported record premiums in 2021. That November, Christie’s sold a crocodile-skin version for nearly $390,000, the second-highest price ever paid for a handbag at auction at the time.Hermes, which went public in 2013, hit its all-time highest price in trading Tuesday.To win, the lawsuit will have to prove that Hermès is a monopoly and that its product tie-in strategy is illegal.Both face significant hurdles, antitrust experts say.“It’s particularly challenging because, as it stands, proving a monopoly claim is hard. Plus they have to prove a tie-in,” said Christine Bartholomew, a professor at University at Buffalo School of Law.Hermès is likely to claim that its tactics were done to preserve brand loyalty in a competitive market, and the plaintiffs will have to refute this, Bartholomew said.John Mark Newman, a University of Miami School of Law professor and former deputy director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Competition, said that the plaintiffs face an uphill battle claiming a monopoly.Even if they lose, however, it has already shed light on an alleged practice that could be embarrassing for shoppers.“At least according to the complaint, Hermes representatives basically told these people that they aren’t good enough to buy a Birkin bag,” Newman said. “It could be these plaintiffs partly just want to tell their story to the world. If so, they’ve definitely accomplished that goal already.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration will take a closer look at safety at United Airlines after a string of nearly a dozen incidents this month, the airline said in a memo Friday.“Over the next several weeks, we will begin to see more of an FAA presence in our operation as they begin to review some of our work processes, manuals and facilities,” United said in a memo to employees obtained by CNN. The review means an “even closer look at multiple areas of our operation to ensure we are doing all we can to promote and drive safety compliance.”On March 15, a United Boeing 737-800 landed in Medford, Oregon, missing an external panel.While no passengers were injured, the incident was just one in a line of recent mishaps on United flights – all involving Boeing jets. In just the last month, another United Boeing plane spewed flames from an engine after taking off, one slid off the runway, one lost a wheel during takeoff, and yet another trailed hydraulic fluid.“The number of safety-related events in recent weeks have rightfully caused us to pause and evaluate whether there is anything we can and should do differently,” the United employee memo said.In a statement, the FAA said its “safety assurance system routinely monitors all aspects of an airline’s operation. It focuses on an airline’s compliance with applicable regulations; ability to identify hazards, assess and mitigate risk; and effectively manage safety.”Boeing, the manufacturer of the vast majority of the jets that United Airlines uses, is also in the spotlight following a series of dramatic incidents involving its planes. The most notable is the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 plane that lost a door plug mid-flight on January 5, leaving a hole in the side of the plane. Last week, a LATAM Airlines flight from Sydney, Australia, to Auckland, New Zealand, plunged in mid-air suddenly, causing some passengers to be injured as they were thrown to the ceiling of the cabin.Both incidents are still under investigation, but an early report from the National Transportation Safety Board found that Boeing may have left bolts off the Alaska Air jet. Boeing has suggested that the LATAM plunge may have been caused by an incident in the cockpit rather than by the plane’s controls.Still, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has said he would look into the possibility of buying more jets from Airbus, Boeing’s European competitor.- CNN’s Pete Muntean and Chris Isidore contributed to reporting."

        "title": "How the Kate photo saga ballooned into a crisis",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Kensington Palace isn’t just the home of the Prince and Princess of Wales. It is a carefully managed brand under the parent company of the British Monarchy, which has a millennium of practice spinning a good yarn.That’s partly why so many people find the palace’s PR strategy around the Case of the Missing Princess hard to comprehend.See here: Public speculation over Kate’s whereabouts and health has ballooned into a social media frenzy of conspiracy theories and memes.Kensington Palace’s attempts to quell that speculation have only made it worse at times – particularly, after it released a Mother’s Day image on March 10 (the Brits do Mother’s Day early), showing the princess and her three children in a photo they say was taken by Prince William that same week.This was supposed to be the photo that put the growing rumors to bed — definitive proof that all is well in the House of Windsor.Instead, it turned everyone with an internet connection into an armchair Photoshop expert and badly damaged the palace’s credibility. Just hours after it was released, major photo agencies issued “kill notices,” after finding that the image had been manipulated by the source. The princess later acknowledged that she had edited some parts of the photo, “like many amateur photographers” do from time to time.“It’s as if they’re deliberately making things worse just to keep Meghan out of the news,” said Eric Soufer, a longtime crisis comms professional in New York (who was referring, of course, to the Duchess of Sussex, formerly Meghan Markle.)It all started going wrong early this year with what many PR experts see as a classic mistake: saying nothing. When gossip about Kate’s health started in January, the palace didn’t feel the need to bat down rumors.Kate had an unspecified abdominal surgery and wouldn’t be resuming her public duties until “after Easter,” it said.The message at the time was, more or less, can everyone please just give the future queen some privacy?And for most people, the answer was yes. A lot of folks outside the UK might not have even heard there was anything fishy going on with the royals, other than the usual simmering drama of a family operating under a relentless media gaze.Then there were the photos, which set the internet on fire with the kind of old-fashioned social media chatter that we haven’t seen since the Dress Discourse of 2015.Given Kate’s popularity, my CNN colleagues wrote, “every inch of it was meticulously scrutinized and eagle-eyed royal-watchers quickly questioned the absence of either her wedding or engagement ring and the lush greenery in the background despite the currently bitter March temperatures.”The following day, the official Kensington Palace X account released a statement from Kate, who apologized for any confusion created by her photo editing “experiment.”With that one photo, though, Kensington Palace wrecked its credibility with the press and much of the public.It was a “Keep Calm and Carry On” comms strategy that’s worked for the palace before. But without more details from royal spokespeople, the internet did what the internet does best: Take mostly harmless internet chatter and amplify it until it goes viral.Media organizations, including CNN, are now reviewing all handout photos previously provided by the palace.This week, Getty Images said it found another official photograph that was digitally manipulated. A CNN analysis found potential alterations in as many as 19 places.Reuters news agency said Wednesday that it is updating its procedures for vetting images from Kensington Palace following the discovery of the second altered photograph. That photograph — of Queen Elizabeth with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren — was taken by Kate and released by Kensington Palace last year.“Consistent with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles, Reuters requires that photos meet its editorial standards for image quality, accuracy and reliability,” a Reuters spokesperson said in a statement.The photo scandal also raised questions about the circumstances in which the media should be accepting and scrutinizing handout photos – from any source – particularly in the age of AI and easy photo editing.Media, including CNN, frequently disseminate photos from government officials and other sources to bring audiences images taken behind closed doors – think the famous Situation Room photo from 2011 of President Barack Obama and his advisers during the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound. But the Kate photo scandal illustrates how even professional photojournalists have to constantly update and challenge their processes.Once upon a time, it might have been easier to a) get away with doctoring images and b) rebuild your trust with journalists when you drop the ball.But in the era of TikTok and YouTube, cleaning up your PR mess is a lot harder.The hordes of royal gossipers are not letting up, even after new images of Kate emerged on Tuesday.In a video published by the British tabloid The Sun, Kate appears healthy walking alongside her husband at a “farm shop” on Saturday.Fans drew a sigh of relief. But the cynical crowd instantly began accusing the palace of deception. That’s “Fake Kate,” as one TikTok user claimed. “Look at the height differential!” The top comment on that post reads: “Listen girl my tin foil hat is ON and I’m with you.” Another quipped: “I think you’re insane, and yet I trust you entirely.”All of this is, of course, mostly harmless internet chatter. But the persistence of the conspiracies speaks to how badly the palace has lost control of the narrative.Keeping calm and carrying on, under the circumstances, now looks more like keeping quiet and hoping everyone will look the other way.— Brett Roegiers contributed to this article."

        "title": "CNBC invited Trump on its air. The network didn’t even try to stop his lies",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.Suffice to say, this was no perfect call.CNBC on Monday made the curious decision to welcome Donald Trump onto its airwaves for an extended live telephone chat, in which the business news network allowed the twice-impeached, four-time indicted, insurrection-inciting former president a safe harbor to make a number of outrageous and false comments without scrutiny.“I believe on the ‘Squawk’ news line, we are joined by former President Donald J. Trump, DJT 45. It is good to welcome you. It’s been a while, Mr. President,” Joe Kernen, co-host of “Squawk Box,” greeted Trump on the air.Almost immediately after commencing the interview, Trump launched into one of his trademark, fact-free rants. Kernen asked the Republican candidate to outline his “vision for the country” following President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address, to which Trump unleashed a stream of deceit-laced drivel. Most notably, he alleged Biden has weaponized the government and that the US legal system under the “very angry and confused man” is now comparable to that of “third-world countries.”Kernen let it all fly. Rather than fact-checking Trump, or at least providing context about the serious allegations he leveled to viewers, the CNBC host brushed the insidious comments aside and attempted to move the interview along. Kernen, trying to conduct a serious interview with a very unserious man, proceeded to asked Trump about his view toward entitlements.But Trump didn’t answer. Instead, he said he disagreed with the premise of the question (that “something has to be done” to rein in entitlement programs) and pivoted to other topics, infusing his rambling response with more lies. The former president, for example, claimed that when he was in office, the country was producing oil at a “much higher level oil” than now.“We were drill, baby, drill,” Trump boasted.But, as those paying attention to the issue know well, Trump’s claim was false. US gas and crude oil production has soared to a record under Biden, surpassing Trump’s term in office. In fact, coincidentally, the US Energy Information Administration put out a press release on Monday noting that in 2023, the US broke all previous records for oil production. Unfortunately, Kernen failed to challenge Trump on the matter.Instead, throughout the interview, the “Squawk” host effectively surrendered the channel’s air to Trump, allowing the dishonest GOP candidate to abuse the platform and mislead its audience of influential viewers — all by phone.To be fair to the “Squawk” crew, it was not only Kernen who had the opportunity to ask Trump questions during the Trump chat. Co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin attempted at times to press Trump on various issues, such as his reversal on whether the US should ban TikTok. While Kernen showed no interest in holding Trump accountable, Sorkin at least tried to compel Trump to include some substance in his responses, though it was largely to no avail.Watching the CNBC interview felt like being transported in time to 2015, back when news outlets allowed Trump to phone in to news shows and deliver a drive-by of lies to their audiences. Even after the interview aired, CNBC waited hours to do the bare minimum and publish digital stories fact-checking some of Trump’s claims. Instead, the outlet quickly spliced Trump’s comments into a handful of clips and posted them online, amplifying his comments further.It is hard to see how any responsible news executive would defend CNBC’s actions as beneficial, nevermind smart. Asked why the network allowed Trump to repeatedly lie on its air without scrutiny, a CNBC spokesperson told me: “We asked former President Trump questions that are important to our audience such as social security and entitlement spending, and challenged him throughout the discussion on business issues like tariffs and their impact on the nation’s relationship with China. Additionally, the CNBC digital team has followed up with reporting throughout the day pointing out areas of inaccuracies and including comments from others questioning his statements.”Regardless of how debatable that characterization is, it is remarkable that after nearly a decade of covering Trump as a politician, prominent news outlets, having witnessed the democracy-threatening effects of Trump’s lies, have reverted to lowering their guardrails, allowing him to once again poison the public discourse with false claims. It’s even more striking given the stakes.Trump has publicly confessed he would like to rule as a strongman and exact revenge on his political opponents, should he win in November. He has even explicitly threatened NBCU News Group parent Comcast over the media giant’s political coverage, calling its chairman Brian Roberts in November a “slime ball” and declaring “our so-called ‘government’ should come down hard on them.” (Trump was notably never asked about these overt threats during his Monday interview on CNBC.)Instead of recognizing the threat Trump poses and assuming a more cautious stance, NBC News Group appears to be moving in the opposite direction. MSNBC has recently started taking Trump’s public remarks live (to the vocal objection of star host Rachel Maddow) and CNBC is now welcoming Trump to its air for friendly chats.At the end of Monday’s “Squawk” interview, Trump claimed his legal problems “aren’t legal issues” but “Biden issues;” falsely claimed Biden installed Fani Willis as the Fulton County district attorney; alleged without evidence Biden has “weaponized government” to target him; raged against E. Jean Carroll and again called her accusation of sexual assault “false,” prompting her attorney to suggest maybe she will sue him again; and ominously warned about the “fragile” state of the country and how “people are rejecting” the government for supposedly targeting him.Kernen, a purported newsman, apparently didn’t find any of those issues worth confronting Trump on. Instead, he thanked Trump for appearing on the program and immediately moved to invite him on again for more interviews.“We appreciate all the time you’ve given us this morning, Mr. President,” Kernen said. “I look forward to another conversation in the not-too-distant future.”"

        "title": "OpenAI’s wild week. How the Sam Altman story unfolded",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week’s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating.Sam Altman — the leader of one of the world’s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the most visible figure in the fledgling industry — was fired Friday night by the startup’s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he’s back as the company’s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision.The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot.If you’re just catching up, here’s what you missed from a week so incredible you’d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI’s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public.Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board.Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO.OpenAI’s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman’s ouster just minutes before the board’s announcement.Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he “loved working with such talented people” and that he would have “more to say about what’s next later.”Brockman promptly quit. “Please don’t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,” Brockman said in a Friday post on X. “Greater things coming soon.”A key factor in the CEO’s firing was tension between Altman, who favored developing AI more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events.Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture.OpenAI’s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return.By Sunday afternoon, Altman was back at OpenAI’s headquarters — this time with a guest badge — to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman’s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO.But those talks broke down.As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon’s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI’s chief technology officer.In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as “a once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman’s firing.But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company’s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met.Altman posted on X, saying, “we have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i’m so excited. one team, one mission.”The drama was far from over. The Verge reported Monday afternoon that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign.And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was “open to both options” when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft.“Look, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,” Nadella said. “We chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.”Altman was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI’s CEO, the company said on X.“We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo.“We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said.In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm’s “strong partnership” with Microsoft.It’s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman’s return. Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work … I’m glad to have been a part of the solution.”Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X.Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI.“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”"

        "title": "FBI tells Alaska Airlines passengers they may be ‘victim of a crime’",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Passengers on board the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 that suffered a terrifying midair blowout in January have received a letter from the FBI saying they may be victims “of a crime.”Attorney Mark Lindquist, who represents multiple passengers that were on Alaska Airlines flight 1282, shared with CNN the letter that the FBI office in Seattle sent to passengers on Tuesday.“I’m contacting you because we have identified you as a possible victim of a crime,” the letter reads in part. It also notes that the FBI is currently investigating the case.“My clients and I welcome the DOJ investigation,” Lindquist told CNN, “We want accountability. We want answers. We want safer Boeing planes. And a DOJ investigation helps advance our goals.”Attorney Robert Clifford, who represents many family members of the 2019 crash victims of a Boeing 737 Max jet flown by Ethiopian Air as well as some of the recent Alaska Air passengers, said some of his clients on Alaska Air also got the letter notifying them that they could be crime victims.“I’m certain everyone on the plane will be getting this letter,” he told CNN. “The families of the Ethiopian Air victims should have also been considered crime victims.”In addition to the letters that went out to passengers, flight attendants aboard Alaska Air Flight 1282 have been interviewed by investigators from the Justice Department, according to people familiar with the situation.The letters were first reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier this month.“The FBI does not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation,” FBI Seattle’s Public Affairs Office wrote in an email to CNN, citing Department of Justice policy.But Justice opened a probe into the incident and Boeing in February, CNN has previously reported. That investigation carries the potential to upend a controversial deferred prosecution agreement that Boeing reached with the Justice Department in the final month of the Trump administration.Tha settlement, which was criticized by families of crash victims and members of Congress, was over charges that Boeing defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process for the 737 Max jets. Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of that settlement, but most of that was money Boeing had already agreed to pay to the airlines that had purchased the Max jets grounded for 20 months following the Ethiopian Air crash and an earlier crash in Indonesia.The deferred prosecution agreement could have ended the threat of Boeing facing criminal liability for those earlier fraud charges. But the Alaska Air incident came just days before a three-year probation-like period was due to end, so the criminal probe could expose Boeing to charges not just for the Alaska Air incident but also the earlier allegations of criminal wrongdoing.Boeing declined to comment.On January 5, 171 passengers and six crew members boarded the flight in Portland, Oregon, bound for Ontario, California. Abruptly after take off, a panel of the fuselage called the “door plug” blew off, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing.A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the jet, which was delivered to Alaska by Boeing in October, had left Boeing’s factory without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place.While the NTSB has yet to assess blame for the missing bolts, it has criticized Boeing for not having the documentation available showing who worked on the door plug when the plane was at Boeing’s factory.The FAA has also found multiple problems with production practices of both Boeing and its major supplier Spirit AeroSystems following a six-week audit of Boeing triggered by the January 5 door plug blowout.Subpoenas from the Justice Department were also recently sent seeking documents and information that may be related to Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems and mentions the “door plug” that is used in the Boeing 737 Max 9s, according to a report from Bloomberg.Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors last month that “We caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.”The development comes the same week Boeing said it will report massive losses in the first quarter stemming from the Alaska Airlines incident.The losses will be in part because of compensation to airlines that owned the Max 9, which was grounded for three weeks after the incident. Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci told investors last month that the incident cost his airline about $150 million, and that it expected to be compensated for those losses by Boeing.The other contributors to losses will be “all the things we’re doing around the factory,” Chief Financial Officer Brian West said on Wednesday, leading to slower production at its 737 Max plant in Renton Washington."

        "title": "Could real estate go the way of the travel industry? Not quite",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Technology has revolutionized how people book travel, buy groceries and manage their everyday finances. Yet, the process of buying a home has withstood many similar changes.Sites like Redfin and Zillow provide a way for buyers and brokers to connect online, but the role of real estate agents in closing purchases has persisted.Now the seismic settlement between the National Association of Realtors and home sellers could change that, as home buyers and sellers face the prospect of paying their agents separately, instead of sellers paying a commission split between both sides. That, in turn, opens the door for new technology to reshape the agents’ role, as people in other jobs — from the world of finance to travel — have already experienced.Given the settlement, Tomasz Piskorski, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School, said buyers’ agents might see their work simplified through technology consumers can use themselves, similar to changes in money management.“I think we are reaching a point where there’s going to be a lot of innovation in the housing market,” Piskorski said. “One simple idea is: Do homeowners really need a real estate agent?”Nearly half of home buyers began their search online, according to a 2023 report by the NAR, and many buyers do home research themselves.“Ultimately, people will understand what real estate agents really do, especially on the buy side,” Piskorski said. “The whole business model actually under which we operate right now makes these fees not very transparent to home buyers.”Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told CNN in an email that technology could make things easier for buyers in an industry that has often been opaque.“Ultimately, if these changes bring about greater consumer transparency, that’s a good thing,” Hale told CNN.But even with the possibility of major changes, Hale said, one thing will almost certainly remain the same for real estate agents. Buyers, she noted, “will likely be reluctant to navigate the financial decision of a lifetime without their professional expertise and support.”The NAR settlement essentially decouples the buyers’ and sellers’ agents. While previously home sellers have paid a commission (generally 5% to 6%) that was split between agents, the settlement makes it so home buyers might be on the hook for paying their agent up front.Experts told CNN that could affect how home buyers think about enlisting an agent.Currently, the framework of real estate solely emphasizes the buy and sell transaction, said John Bodrozic, co-founder of HomeZada, a real estate tech company. Yet, as technology simplifies the process, agents will have to advertise their value as long-term consultants in a niche industry.Bodrozic said tech will enable real estate to become more like personal finance in this sense.“I really believe it’s a bigger picture here, which is the opportunity for the real estate industry to think of their clients as a never-ending client that I want to keep happy and provide value to throughout their entire journey,” he said.Bobby Juncosa, chief technology officer of Edgewise, a real estate tech company, said there are lessons from how travel agents changed as technology has allowed people to search for, compare and purchase flights on their own.“The buyers’ agent will become, this is the part that’s a little bit more controversial, but a little bit more travel agent-esque, and they’re kind of pointing you in the right direction,” he said. “You know, ‘this neighborhood has good schools,’ all things that are public information that you could find out on your own, but you’re hoping for that local expertise.”A lot of real estate transactions could be digitized, and this settlement may provide impetus for that, Piskorski said. He said developments in tech that organize home inspections, make arrangements to hire lawyers or fulfill other duties of a buyers’ agent, would “significantly reduce the costs associated with home transactions.”Even as technology expands further into the real estate industry, Piskorski said he thinks a fully automated process, such as an Amazon marketplace for buying and selling homes, is still far in the distance.The real estate market, he said, is “too complex to be completely automated on a computer.”Juncosa said as the industry adjusts to the settlement rules, agents will become more like consultants throughout the home buying process, offering value-add insight. Yet what ultimately differentiates a travel agent from a real estate agent is the value and risk associated with the purchase.Purchasing a home is a major life decision, and some people will always benefit from the assurance of a broker, Juncosa said.A key point of home buying is the behavioral aspect, Piskorski said. “Some households just want a human being to be with them, to assure them that this is the right decision,” he said.Ultimately, Juncosa said that agents serve a fundamentally human purpose: reassuring homebuyers about the biggest financial decisions of their lives."

        "title": "Condé Nast’s parent made a $2 billion windfall from Reddit’s IPO. Now come the uncomfortable questions",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.Executives at Advance Publications are likely popping champagne bottles. But as they sip on their celebratory bubbly they are now being confronted with some uncomfortable questions.The S.I. Newhouse-founded media company, which owns the Condé Nast suite of prestigious magazines and local news outlets across the country, netted approximately $2.1 billion on Thursday when Reddit went public on the New York Stock Exchange in a long-awaited blockbuster IPO.The social media company, which priced its offering at $34 a share, rocketed 48% on its first day, closing above $50 in an impressive public debut for the 20-year-old message board platform.It’s quite a return on an investment for Advance, which acquired the “front page of the internet” for a mere $10 million in 2006, before spinning it off in 2011 and allowing others to invest in the digital forum.The windfall, however, comes at a notable time for the company. Like other media giants facing existential headwinds, Advance’s publications have endured a sustained downturn in digital advertising and seen traffic from social media platforms decline, prompting uncomfortable belt-tightening and scaled-back ambitions.Condé Nast has for months been engaged in a standoff with its union. The company announced in November that it planned to lay off 94 staffers, or roughly 5% of its workforce. (It has said it will keep operating costs consistent with the last three years, but that it wants to invest in different areas, necessitating the layoffs.)Tensions have only escalated since then. Condé Nast boss Roger Lynch told Axios’ Sara Fischer earlier this month that, while it missed its revenue target, there were no plans for further layoffs. But the Condé Union said this week that management had effectively gone back on its word and added another five staffers to its layoff list, inflaming already high emotions and prompting renewed protests Wednesday outside Lynch’s office.While Advance cannot sell its shares for six months, laying off staffers as it reaps billions of dollars from Reddit’s IPO would present, at minimum, an optics problem for Condé Nast, which has been bruised in recent months during union negotiations. The earnings also offer a few uncomfortable questions for the company. Will Advance go through with such cuts while it rains cash over at company headquarters? How can Advance expect Condé Nast management to push through with painful layoffs while the parent company experiences a gold rush?I asked representatives for Advance on Thursday if the $2 billion+ windfall it stood to reap had given it any second thoughts on allowing Condé Nast to move forward with the layoffs. As you might expect, representatives for the company were not too keen on answering such questions. My multiple emails went unreturned.But the IPO bonanza has certainly secured the attention of employees at Condé Nast. And it is sure to be a factor as the union continues contract negotiations with management. While Advance is remaining mum about the massive sum it has made on its Reddit bet, the union is already speaking out.“The fact that billions of dollars in wealth poured into Advance as we continue to fight for jobs illustrates where Condé Nast’s priorities are,” Susan DeCarava, president of The NewsGuild of New York, told me. “Management needs to stop investing in threats and start investing in the concerns of the workers who power the company’s success.”"

        "text": "Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg.Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17.That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm’s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company.Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman’s firing, is also joining Microsoft.Altman’s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive.Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the “Magnificent Seven” that have powered the lion’s share of the market’s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street’s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, reiterated his $425 price target for Microsoft’s stock following Altman’s and Brockman’s hires.“We view Microsoft now even in a stronger position from an AI perspective with Altman and Brockman” at the company, Ives wrote in a note on Monday.Other members of the “Magnificent Seven” saw a boost on Monday. Nvidia shares gained 2.3% to end the trading session at $504.20 ahead of its earnings due on Tuesday, notching a record-high close for the chipmaker."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Whether it’s an unexpected car repair or an emergency room visit, life happens. And it’s expensive. For those without any kind of safety net, paying for unanticipated expenses can mean borrowing money at astronomical interest rates, as well as forking over late fees if you can’t make payments on time.And while surveys indicate that there are plenty of people in just such a situation, there are some inexpensive and safe ways to access emergency funds.In a May 2023 report on the economic well-being of US households, the Federal Reserve reported that only 63% of Americans said they would pay an unexpected $400 expense with their own cash or cash equivalent (e.g. putting it on a credit card but paying that bill in full when it comes due). Of the remaining 37%, most indicated they would borrow the money (using everything from credit cards to payday loans to friends or family). Some said they would sell something to foot the bill. And 13% indicated they simply would not be able to pay it.Another survey, released by Bankrate.com in January, found that only 44% of US adults said they could pay a $1,000 emergency expense from their savings, while 35% indicated they would have to borrow the money. In that latter group, 21% said they would finance it with a credit card; 10% would borrow the money from family or friends, and 4% say they would take out a personal loan. Another 16% say they would have to reduce their spending on other things.An earlier survey by Bankrate, meanwhile, found that two-thirds of US adults worried they don’t have enough emergency savings to cover them if they lost their primary source of income. Typically, that would mean at least three months’ worth of living expenses.Credit card interest rates remain sky-high — the average at the end of February was 20.75%, according to Bankrate.com, with average penalty rates pushing 30%. So simply charging an emergency expense to a high-rate card should be your last resort.You might, however, look for a new credit card with a 0% introductory rate that will be in effect for a year or more, said Noah Damsky, founder of Marina Wealth Advisors. “This will provide you with the short-term cash you need, and provide you potentially with 18 months to pay it back, without interest.”Just be sure to pay it all back before the 0% introductory period ends, otherwise a high rate will kick in for the remaining balance.If your emergency is medical or dental in nature, ask the health provider if they offer a payment plan. “Many providers offer plans without interest, allowing you to spread the cost over several months,” said Marcel Miu, lead wealth planner at Simplify Wealth Planning.For some people, another low-cost option might be to borrow from a close relative or friend, but only if doing so would not jeopardize your relationship — which is a very personal decision. “While this option requires careful consideration and clear communication about repayment terms, it can be a way to cover expenses without the formalities and costs associated with traditional loans,” Miu said.In recent years, alternative ways to access cash have also been created outside of the traditional financial system, which has proven expensive for many families.Daisy Martini, a 29-year-old working for New York City’s Department of Education, felt she didn’t have many good options after she’d been temporarily laid off during the pandemic. Her bills were piling up and she had already accrued high credit card balances from her years in school.So to get small, short-term loans to tide her over, she turned to SoLo Funds, a community financing platform that puts borrowers in the driver seat: They decide how much they need to borrow, when they can pay it back and how much they’re willing to pay a lender as a “tip” for providing the loan. That tip can never exceed 15% of the loan. Borrowers may offer a much smaller tip, or even nothing. It’s up to lenders to decide if they will accept the borrowers’ terms. Loan amounts can’t exceed $575 and the average is $248, according to SoLo cofounder Rodney Williams. Once borrowers repay in full, they can then borrow again.Besides using SoLo for small emergency expenses, such as fixing a leak in the roof, Martini said she sometimes uses it for expenses she has a week ahead of when she knows she will be paid. She likes the platform better than the more anonymous interactions with a credit card company. Knowing who is lending to her gives her even more incentive to pay what she owes on time.“I knew if I borrowed from someone in the community who cared, I would … pay them back. You’re paying someone back who empathizes with your story,” she said.While getting a low-cost loan to tide you over in a pinch may be a relief, not having to borrow at all is optimal.To make the next emergency expense less stressful and costly, you can build emergency savings with small amounts consistently over time.Damsky recommends setting up automatic daily transfers from your checking account to a savings account. For example, he said, if you want to save roughly $150 a month, you could set up a transfer of just $5 a day or $35 a week. At the end of a year, you will have built up more than $1,800, plus whatever interest you earn on those savings. To maximize that interest, try to transfer your money into a high-yielding online savings account, which currently pay between 4% and 5%, according to Bankrate.com.The same pattern applies if your goal is to have at least three months of living expenses to protect you in case you lose your job. “Even small amounts, if consistent, can accumulate over time,” Miu said.He also recommends redirecting at least a portion of one-time annual windfalls — such as a tax refund or bonus — to a high-yield savings account.Two other proven ways to bolster emergency savings are increasing your income (e.g., taking on a side gig,) or cutting back on spending that you do not consider essential to your life, said Linda Grizely, a fee-only planner at Visions Financial Planning. But, she cautioned, ”It’s important to strike a balance and avoid excessive cuts. A plan that can be adhered to is the key to success.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "London — An Australian computer scientist who claims he invented bitcoin is not “Satoshi Nakamoto,” the pseudonymous inventor of the cryptocurrency, a judge at London’s High Court ruled on Thursday.Craig Wright has long claimed to have been the author of a 2008 white paper, the foundational text of bitcoin, published under the pseudonym.The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) took Wright to court to stop him suing bitcoin developers, asking for a ruling that Wright was not Satoshi.Judge James Mellor said at the end of closing arguments on Thursday that the evidence Wright was not Satoshi was “overwhelming.”“Dr Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin white paper,” Mellor said. “Dr Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011.”COPA, whose members include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s payments firm Block (SQ), said the ruling was “a win for developers, for the entire open source community and for the truth.”“For over eight years, Dr Wright and his financial backers have lied about his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto and used that lie to bully and intimidate developers in the bitcoin community,” a COPA spokesperson said in a statement.“That ends today with the court’s ruling that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.”A spokesperson for Wright said he was “not prepared to speak to anyone at this time.”COPA had accused Wright of repeatedly forging documents to substantiate his claim, including during the trial itself, which Wright denied when he gave evidence.Its lawyer, Jonathan Hough, said at the start of the trial in February that Wright’s claim was “a brazen lie, an elaborate false narrative supported by forgery on an industrial scale.”Hough said that “there are elements of Dr Wright’s conduct that stray into farce,” citing his alleged use of ChatGPT to produce forgeries.But he added: “Dr Wright’s conduct is also deadly serious. On the basis of his dishonest claim to be Satoshi, he has pursued claims he puts at hundreds of billions of dollars, including against numerous private individuals.”Wright’s lawyers, however, argued in court filings that he had produced “clear evidence demonstrating his authorship of the white paper and creation of bitcoin.”In their closing arguments, COPA’s lawyers asked Mellor to refer the case to Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service “for consideration of prosecution for the offenses of perjury and perverting the course of justice.”Mellor did not indicate whether or not he would do so."

        "title": "What happened when the world’s most populous nation turned off TikTok",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "As TikTok fans in the United States worry about losing access to the wildly-popular social media app, there are lessons they can learn from a country on the other side of the world.On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban. While the Chinese-owned app is not disappearing from Americans’ phones anytime soon, many of its 170 million users in the country are deeply rattled.But here is what they need to know: It is possible to survive and thrive in a TikTok-less world. Just ask the planet’s most populous nation.In June 2020, after a violent clash on the India-China border that left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead, the government in New Delhi suddenly banned TikTok and several other well-known Chinese apps.“It’s important to remember that when India banned TikTok and multiple Chinese apps, the US was the first to praise the decision,” said Nikhil Pahwa, the Delhi-based founder of tech website MediaNama. “[Former] US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had welcomed the ban, saying it ‘will boost India’s sovereignty.’”While India’s abrupt decision shocked the country’s 200 million TikTok users, in the four years since, many have found other suitable alternatives.“The ban on Tiktok led to the creation of a multibillion dollar opportunity … A 200 million user base needed somewhere to go,” said Pahwa, adding that it was ultimately American tech companies that seized the moment with their new offerings.The ban was not without pain. Indian TikTokkers had to grapple with confusion and even anguish in the days and months that followed.By 2020, TikTok had become hugely popular among Indians looking for relief from the pressures of strict Covid-related lockdowns.“Everyone in India wants to be a Bollywood star, and TikTok made that dream possible by making people, including those in small towns, overnight stars,” said Saptarshi Ray, head of product at Viralo, a Bengaluru-based influencer marketing platform.But it didn’t take long before other avenues for their creativity and commercial ventures sprang up.A ferocious fight ensued between US tech giants and domestic startups to fill the gap. Within a week of the ban, Meta-owned Instagram cashed in by launching its TikTok copycat, Instagram Reels, in India. Google introduced its own short video offering, YouTube Shorts.Homegrown alternatives such as MX Taka Tak and Moj also began seeing a rise in popularity and an infux in funding.Those local startups soon fizzled out, however, unable to match the reach and financial firepower of the American firms, which are flourishing.Citing independent findings from consulting firm Oxford Economics, a Google spokesperson said that “the YouTube creative ecosystem” contributed roughly $2 billion to the Indian economy in 2022.According to Ray, Indian content creators swiftly moved all the old content they had shot for TikTok to Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. “Some Influencers were uploading seven Reels a day and gaining four to five million subscribers a year,” he said.But not everyone was able to build a significant following on these platforms.“Many users and creators slipped into a deep, dark space after the ban, and some have still not emerged from that space,” said Clyde Fernandes, executive director— artist management at Opraahfx, an influencer marketing and management firm.“The way one was gaining reach and followers on TikTok is [still] incomparable to any other platform out there at the moment,” he added.US officials and lawmakers have long voiced concerns that the Chinese government could compel TikTok’s parent ByteDance to hand over data collected from American users.Cybersecurity experts say that the national security concerns surrounding TikTok remain largely hypothetical. Indian experts, however, say its purge from national digital life hasn’t resulted in a safer space.“I am not so sure removal of TikTok makes a dent in the cybersecurity threat landscape. Unless there is a step change in user awareness about the software on their phones, or what they download from the open internet, this is unlikely to change,” said Vivan Sharan, partner at Delhi-based tech policy consulting firm Koan Advisory Group.US lawmakers also fear that the app could serve as a tool for Beijing to spread propaganda, misinformation or influence Americans. The removal of TikTok hasn’t insulated Indians from those threats.“In terms of content and disinformation environment, it is plain to see we still have to grapple with serious issues like deepfakes, etc, with or without TikTok,” Sharan said. “So overall, it is hard to see which part of the risk-landscape changes significantly, assuming TikTok was certifiably problematic.”"

        "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.The dwindling ranks of the Magnificent Seven are finally getting reinforcements.The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite indexes notched record highs on Wednesday and Thursday after the Federal Reserve reiterated its forecast for three quarter-point rate cuts in 2024. Investors had worried that the central bank would adjust its expectations to fewer than three cuts following a slate of hot inflation data in recent months.But more stocks than just Big Tech have paved the way higher. The S&P 600 index, which tracks American small-cap stocks, just turned positive for the year. That’s good news for Wall Street, because smaller companies generate most of their revenue from US customers, making them bellwethers of the US economy. Small caps are often active in sectors like financials and industrials that tend to rise and fall with wider economic activity.“When you see small-cap industrials leading, that’s usually a sign that the market is saying things are on pretty firm footing here,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group.Their participation also shows that the market’s surge is extending beyond tech giants. That’s a welcome sign for investors, since a broader rally begets a healthier rally. When the market’s gains don’t depend on just a handful of names, they’re less vulnerable to pullbacks.The rally had already begun broadening in recent weeks, before the Fed-induced euphoria. Some investors say that’s because corporate earnings beats coupled with strong economic data have renewed hopes for a soft landing, or a scenario in which the Fed brings inflation down to its 2% target without triggering a recession.About 93% of S&P 500 companies have posted fourth-quarter results, and 78% have beat earnings expectations, according to Ned Davis Research data through March 19.“Recession” was mentioned in 47 fourth-quarter earnings calls of S&P 500 companies, the lowest count since 2021, according to FactSet data through March 7. In contrast, “soft landing” was cited on 37 earnings calls, the highest number of companies mentioning the term going back at least three years.Meanwhile, jobs data in recent months shows that the labor market is staying resilient against interest rates hovering at a 23-year high.That has led stocks to continue soaring after last year’s powerful rally, even though shares of Tesla and Apple have fallen, while Alphabet has lagged the double-digit percentage gains notched by Magnificent Seven peers Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta.Still, Detrick says that a 5% to 7% selloff wouldn’t be worrisome: “Just enough to shake out those johnny-come-lately weak hands … because [the rally is] almost too easy,” he said.Wall Street could also be getting too ahead of itself by expecting such a rosy outcome for the economy, some investors say.“It’s going to be important for investors to ascertain what expectations that have been embedded are realistic and which expectations are a little bit too optimistic,” said Jeffrey Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments.The US Justice Department and more than a dozen states filed a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, accusing the giant company of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market, report my colleagues Brian Fung, Hannah Rabinowitz and Evan Perez.It’s the largest in a recent string of Big Tech companies to face antitrust complaints from the US government, which is cracking down on the massive industry, whose power has gone largely unchecked over the past several decades.The complaint, said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a news conference, alleges that ”Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal antitrust law.”“Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,” he added.The long-anticipated lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its “walled-garden” approach to its hardware and software: Apple famously makes its tech easy to use, but it achieves that by tightly controlling — and in some cases, restricting — how third-party companies can interact with the tech behemoth’s products and services. In some cases, Apple may give its own products better access and features than its competitors.The company said it denied the lawsuit’s allegations and would fight them and added that the lawsuit could empower the government “to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”But Garland on Thursday said Apple’s actions have wide-ranging effects.“Monopolies like Apple’s threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers and increase cost for consumers,” Garland said Thursday.Read more here.The Swiss National Bank surprised markets Thursday by cutting interest rates, becoming the first of the world’s major central banks to do so since they began battling a post-pandemic surge in prices.The SNB announced that it would reduce the cost of borrowing by a quarter of a percentage point as it revised down its forecasts for inflation this year and next, reports my colleague Anna Cooban. “The fight against inflation over the past two and a half years has been effective,” it said in a statement.Pressure is also building for the European Central Bank to cut rates for the 20 countries that use the euro. Data released Thursday suggested the region’s economy went backward in March, bolstering the case for the ECB to break with tradition and reduce rates before the US Federal Reserve.The Purchasing Managers’ Index showed a slight increase to 49.9 in March, driven by expansion in the services sector, but remained below the 50 mark that separates contraction from growth.Europe’s manufacturers have spent the best part of the past two years grappling with steep energy costs, which surged after Russia invaded Ukraine. Manufacturing remains mired in a deep contraction, according to the latest PMI numbers.Read more here."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly attacked the network and its journalists, assailed the news media as “fake news” and promoted false claims around the 2020 vote, as an on-air commentator ahead of the 2024 presidential election.“It couldn’t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna’s on the team,” Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo to staff.McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016.During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions.McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as “fake news” and calling the media “corrupt.” At times, she even targeted NBC News and MSNBC with dishonest attacks.In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News’ chief foreign correspondent, of “actively cheering for an economic downturn.”“How can NBC let him keep his job when he’s made his bias so clear?” McDaniel asked.McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for “spreading lies” and blasted those she described as the network’s “primetime propagandists.”An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC.In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest.McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel told the officials, regarding the certification: “Do not sign it. … We will get you attorneys.”The Michigan Department of State’s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had “no merit.” The state’s “elections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,” it said in a detailed fact check posted online.In an interview with CNN’s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting “irregularity” in the election.“I think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don’t think that’s election denying,” McDaniel told Wallace. “I’m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I’m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That’s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that’s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.”In the interview, Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election.“I think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,” she said. “But I don’t think he won it fair. I don’t. I’m not going to say that.”NBC’s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the network’s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president.Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network’s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air without scrutiny.MSNBC has even started carrying Trump’s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump’s lies on the air is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it “irresponsible.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Amid a housing shortage and an affordability crisis, US homebuilding heated up in February as builders anticipate demand for new homes to stay strong.One sure way to improve affordability is to increase the availability of apartments to rent and homes to buy. In areas of the country where there has been robust homebuilding, rents and home price increases have been more moderate.The pace of new housing starts soared by 10.7% in February from the month before, after slumping in January, according to data released Thursday by the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.Starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.521 million units last month, beating analysts’ estimates of 1.425 million. The pace rebounded from January’s revised pace of 1.374 million and was 5.9% above the 1.436 million pace a year ago.Meanwhile, the pace of new building permits was up 1.9% from January, which was up 2.4% from a year ago.While the number of existing homes on the market remains historically low, new construction has provided a critical alternative for homebuyers.Mortgage applications for a newly constructed home were up a whopping 15.7% in February from a year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association; and up by 1% from January. The average loan size jumped to its highest level since last March at almost $406,000, but it was still below the record high of more than $436,000 in April 2022.“It is possible that we could see more wiggle room on pricing in the coming months, as the inventory of existing homes begins to expand,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright Multiple Listing Service, in a statement.Prospective homebuyers who are looking at new construction are still finding some builders offering concessions, upgrades, or favorable financing terms, she said.But, according to the NAHB, fewer builders are offering price cuts.The much lower mortgage rates that many homebuyers expected have yet to materialize, but builders want to be ready for when that does happen.Mortgage rates have come down from their highest levels of last year — 7.79% in October — and are now about a full percentage point below that, at 6.74%.“Lower mortgage rates are likely to bring buyers to the market in larger numbers, and builders are ramping up supply to meet this demand,” said Kelly Mangold of RCLCO Real Estate Consulting, in a statement.While existing home inventory has ticked up lately, as is typical this time of year, there is still a historically low number of homes on the market as owners see the gap between their ultra-low rate and prevailing rates as still too wide.That creates an opportunity for homebuilders who can provide inventory.“Homebuilders continue to be bullish about the spring market as homeowners are still reluctant to list their homes for sale and new homes account for an outsized share of the active inventory,” said Sturtevant.Homebuilder confidence improved this month even as mortgage rates climbed, according to a survey from the National Association of Home Builders released Monday.The lack of existing inventory that continues to push buyers toward new home construction led homebuilder sentiment index to the highest level since July and marked the fourth consecutive monthly gain for the index.Housing affordability amid high inflation and elevated interest rates remains a hot-button issue for the White House as well as the Federal Reserve.President Joe Biden is set to address the housing shortage Tuesday in a speech from Las Vegas, where the cost of rent has increased 30% from before the pandemic and the cost to buy a home has risen by over 40% since then.Biden is expected to call on Congress to pass legislation that he says could result in the building and renovation of more than 2 million homes to close the housing supply gap and lower housing costs.Housing experts agree there are not enough homes available to rent or own compared to the demand. But the size of that gap ranges from a shortfall of 1.5 million units (according to National Association of Home Builders) to 5.5 million units (according to the National Association of Realtors) or as many as 7 million (according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition and Realtor.com), depending on who is calculating it and what assumptions about housing are being made."

        "title": "Fox News sued by family of Ukrainian journalist killed while covering war over ‘reckless and negligent conduct’",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Fox News is the subject of yet another explosive lawsuit.On the two-year anniversary of the attack in Ukraine that claimed the lives of Fox News photojournalist Pierre Zakrzewski and contractor Oleksandra “Sasha” Kuvshynova, the network was accused Thursday of being culpable for the fatal incident by engaging in “reckless and negligent conduct” that put the crew in harm’s way. The network was also accused of launching “a campaign of material misrepresentations and omissions to hide its own accountability for the disaster and shift blame” to then-security contractor Shane Thomson, who allegedly warned against the crew entering the dangerous zone near Kyiv where they were killed.The lawsuit, filed by Kuvshynova’s parents and Thomson in New York State court, not only named Fox News as a defendant, but also Fox Corporation Chairman Emeritus Rupert Murdoch, Fox News Chief Executive Suzanne Scott, and correspondent Benjamin Hall, who was severely injured in the attack, but survived.Both deaths were announced at the time by Scott, who said the team’s vehicle came under fire as they were reporting. Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Ukrainian interior minister, blamed artillery shelling by Russian forces.But the circumstances that led to the 2022 tragedy, the lawsuit stated, were uncovered as part of a sweeping investigation conducted by lawyers for Thomson and Kuvshynova’s parents to get to the bottom of what happened on March 14, 2022.Their probe found that the circumstances that led to the attack were set into motion when the Fox News team disregarded warnings to avoid the Irpin-Hostomel area near Kyiv. The mayor of Irpin had barred journalists from the city and Thomson, the security contractor, had vetoed the idea of reporting from the area, according to the lawsuit. Disregarding such security warnings would be unusual in a war zone and Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst, who was also reporting from the area at the time, had indicated days prior to the incident that the network’s journalists were following protocol. Heading to the area was considered so dangerous, the lawsuit said, that the Ukrainian driver who had been working with the Fox News team “refused” to take them there, forcing the crew to “find a different driver.”Eventually, when the crew arrived in the region, they rendezvoused with a few Ukrainian soldiers, who had previously escorted The New York Times reporters into the area. That’s when they realized the vehicle the soldiers were driving was “not large enough to carry all” of them, the lawsuit said. The team decided to leave their security consultant behind, the lawsuit explained.“The absence of the security contractor was vital, as the crew made fatal mistakes,” the lawsuit said.The Fox News crew ultimately stopped at an abandoned checkpoint where they were attacked. According to the lawsuit, the “car caught fire and Sasha was burned to ashes inside it, causing her death.” Zakrzewski, the lawsuit said, “managed to escape the car but bled to death at the side of the road from a small puncture wound in his leg.” The lawsuit alleged that “the bleeding could easily have been stemmed to save his life if the security contractor trained in battlefield first aid had been present.” Hall survived the attack and was “later found grievously injured” before being taken for emergency medical care.In the aftermath of the tragedy, the lawsuit alleged that Fox News has tried to cover up its failures and hide them from the public.Fox News took “all electronic gear … that survived the attack” and “withheld any record of any evaluation or re-evaluation of the crew’s assignment,” the lawsuit said. The account of the attack that Hall later recounted in his book published by HarperCollins, the lawsuit added, was “misleading.” And, the lawsuit said, Fox News “has attempted to impose non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements on all the surviving family members.”The lawsuit also alleged that after the fatal incident, Fox News tasked Thomson with transporting Zakrzewski’s body across the Polish border to his widow. The lawsuit said that Thomson objected to the assignment, but was told he had to complete it, and was later “let go from his employment without explanation.”“He was severely traumatized by the combined experience of his colleagues being killed, transporting the dead body of his friend, and then being dismissed,” the lawsuit said. “Shane reached out to Fox repeatedly for assistance with the trauma. Fox never responded, even after Shane attempted suicide by hanging.”The lawsuit alleged that Thomson has had trouble finding work because he is “frequently associated with the Fox News disaster of being security advisor for the crew that was killed in Irpin the day after journalists were banned from the area.” The lawsuit also alleged that Fox News employees spread a bogus story that he had a “drinking problem in Kyiv at the time of the fatal incident, insinuating that this was the cause of the disastrous assignment in which Pierre and Sasha were killed.”Kuvshynova’s parents and Thomson are seeking unspecified punitive damages.“Sasha Kuvshynova’s final text message — responding to her parents, who were highly alarmed by the dangerousness of the situation unfolding on March 14, with Russian forces closing in on Kyiv — was not to worry,” the lawsuit said, “because Fox was a professional news organization that knew what it was doing and would not expose her to unnecessary danger.”"

Or the Apple mouse, with its port on the underside, rendering it unusable while charging.These frustrations don’t make a product bad, per se; they’re just irksome. The kind of little frictions that make you think, Why’d they do that?No standard spoon can fit inside the narrow openings of the typical glass caper jar. Dumping them out risks loss of essential brine. Even if you do have a supremely tiny utensil to fish them out, there’s no single-dip solution: At best you can capture three or four in one go, and any piccata recipe or lox spread worth its salt calls for, like, at least a dozen capers. Why, dear God, why do they do that?This is a story about one of modern life’s least consequential but most acutely annoying experiences: getting a sufficient number of capers out of those dollhouse-size jars they’re sold in.The short, unsatisfying answer? Capers are expensive, so producers sell them in smaller jars to make each unit more affordable. But the reason for tall jars instead of squat ones is a longer story.For the uninitiated, capers are the unripened, pea-sized buds of the prickly caper bush, or Capparis spinosa. Let them ripen, and you get caper berries, which are sort of like olives. The caper bush is a hardy shrub, happiest when rooted on a rocky cliff under a hot Mediterranean sun.Straight off the vine, capers are terribly bitter. But someone, somewhere (likely hundreds of years ago), got it in their heads to take that practically inedible drying them out in a boatload of sea salt and then rehydrating them could make for a tasty ingredient.Once they’re cured and pickled, capers become perfect little salt bombs to drop into a niçoise salad or a chicken piccata. It’s not illegal to order a lox bagel in New York City without capers, but it should be.A definitive explanation for the svelte glass jar that they come in is hard to come by. Major caper purveyors Cento and Goya did not respond to requests for comment.Reddit threads on the subject tend to upvote the theory that the tall, skinny glass jars keep the capers fresh by ensuring they stay submerged in their brine.Russell Zwanka, the director of the food marketing program at Western Michigan University, echoed that as a plausible theory.“I do understand the frustration of a spoon not fitting, and I don’t have an answer for that,” Zwanka said. “I don’t know why you can’t make it just another half an inch bigger.”There is another, more profit-focused theory. It’s courtesy of Jeff Mezzetta, the president of the privately owned California food label Mezzetta (which sells its capers in a variety of jar sizes, all with enough clearance for a regular teaspoon).Skinny jars just look nicer, Mezzetta says.After all, there’s little practical value to the skinny jar. In fact, it’s far less practical, from the producers’ standpoint.“The taller and the thinner the jar, the more difficult it is to package — because they’re tippy on the production lines, and with the smaller opening, they’re harder to get into the jar,” said Mezzetta, a connoisseur so passionate about the garnish that he even named his dog, a black Labrador, Caper.His take: “It’s primarily because some marketer feels that they’re going to look more elegant on the shelf.”There are sound economics behind that theory.Food packaging does a lot of different things, Zwanka says. It of course keeps food fresh, prevents waste and makes sure the product can be shipped efficiently.“But we also want to make sure that products are affordable,” he said.Because capers are expensive — and not exactly a staple of the American refrigerator, although sales are rising, according to Mezzetta — food companies opt for smaller jars to keep down the per-unit cost for consumers.Zwanka notes a similar packaging dilemma with saffron, one of the world’s most expensive spices. When you buy it at the grocery store, it’s perhaps disheartening to see a few tiny strings packed into the jar for $18.“You need the jar so it’ll fit in the in the spice rack,” he says. “But you also couldn’t fill that jar, or it would be $200.”If you’re only using a few capers a year, a tiny jar that can live unobtrusively in the fridge makes sense for most people. Prices vary, but a 3-ounce jar runs you about $4 at the grocery store.Still, you might wonder: Why is it a that jar so tall and narrow you need a nail file to stab at the tiny green orbs?Blame the success of Skinny Can Chic.Strolling down the soda aisle lately, you’ll notice that beverage cans have slimmed down, squeezing the same 12 ounces of fluid into a more slender package.“Consumers see slim cans as more sophisticated, which makes them feel more sophisticated,” Duane Stanford, the editor of industry trade publication Beverage Digest, told CNN last year.The same thing is happening in the beer aisle, Zwanka notes.“They’ve all adapted what you would consider the Red Bull can, because Red Bull kind of started it. But now anybody who wants to signify that it is thinner, lighter, less calories, maybe healthier … they put it thinner cans.”Labor costs are the main reason capers cost more than you might expect from what is essentially a pickled weed. The vast majority of the capers at the grocery store are grown in the wild in places like Morocco, Tunisia, Greece and Turkey, and they are picked by hand.“It takes you an hour to pick a kilo, if you’re very fast,” says Brian Noone, who runs a wholesale caper plant nursery in Adelaide, South Australia. “The other problem is, people tend to think the smaller ones taste better…But it’s a lot more work to get the smaller ones,” which are called “non-pareils.”Once they get to your kitchen, there are a number of hacks for getting them out of the jar.A Reddit page on the universally frustrating process is titled: “getting capers out of those stupid f*cking narrow jars.”Among the tips and tricks offered by Redditors:Try a a long metal bar spoon or a half-teaspoon measuring spoon. Other common utensil suggestions: An old fashioned potato peeler, chef’s tweezers, a tiny melon baller, a wide-mouth boba straw.“I use a tiny fork. Like the kind for shrimp cocktail or crab,” offers one user.“Korean dessert fork for me! It’s a tiny fork head on a long chopstick-shaped handle,” says another.But perhaps there’s no solution quite as simple as going all in — and dumping them all out.As one Redditor said: “I’ve never been in a situation where I don’t decide to just use the entire tiny jar for what I’m making.”"

        "title": "Could real estate go the way of the travel industry? Not quite",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Technology has revolutionized how people book travel, buy groceries and manage their everyday finances. Yet, the process of buying a home has withstood many similar changes.Sites like Redfin and Zillow provide a way for buyers and brokers to connect online, but the role of real estate agents in closing purchases has persisted.Now the seismic settlement between the National Association of Realtors and home sellers could change that, as home buyers and sellers face the prospect of paying their agents separately, instead of sellers paying a commission split between both sides. That, in turn, opens the door for new technology to reshape the agents’ role, as people in other jobs — from the world of finance to travel — have already experienced.Given the settlement, Tomasz Piskorski, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School, said buyers’ agents might see their work simplified through technology consumers can use themselves, similar to changes in money management.“I think we are reaching a point where there’s going to be a lot of innovation in the housing market,” Piskorski said. “One simple idea is: Do homeowners really need a real estate agent?”Nearly half of home buyers began their search online, according to a 2023 report by the NAR, and many buyers do home research themselves.“Ultimately, people will understand what real estate agents really do, especially on the buy side,” Piskorski said. “The whole business model actually under which we operate right now makes these fees not very transparent to home buyers.”Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told CNN in an email that technology could make things easier for buyers in an industry that has often been opaque.“Ultimately, if these changes bring about greater consumer transparency, that’s a good thing,” Hale told CNN.But even with the possibility of major changes, Hale said, one thing will almost certainly remain the same for real estate agents. Buyers, she noted, “will likely be reluctant to navigate the financial decision of a lifetime without their professional expertise and support.”The NAR settlement essentially decouples the buyers’ and sellers’ agents. While previously home sellers have paid a commission (generally 5% to 6%) that was split between agents, the settlement makes it so home buyers might be on the hook for paying their agent up front.Experts told CNN that could affect how home buyers think about enlisting an agent.Currently, the framework of real estate solely emphasizes the buy and sell transaction, said John Bodrozic, co-founder of HomeZada, a real estate tech company. Yet, as technology simplifies the process, agents will have to advertise their value as long-term consultants in a niche industry.Bodrozic said tech will enable real estate to become more like personal finance in this sense.“I really believe it’s a bigger picture here, which is the opportunity for the real estate industry to think of their clients as a never-ending client that I want to keep happy and provide value to throughout their entire journey,” he said.Bobby Juncosa, chief technology officer of Edgewise, a real estate tech company, said there are lessons from how travel agents changed as technology has allowed people to search for, compare and purchase flights on their own.“The buyers’ agent will become, this is the part that’s a little bit more controversial, but a little bit more travel agent-esque, and they’re kind of pointing you in the right direction,” he said. “You know, ‘this neighborhood has good schools,’ all things that are public information that you could find out on your own, but you’re hoping for that local expertise.”A lot of real estate transactions could be digitized, and this settlement may provide impetus for that, Piskorski said. He said developments in tech that organize home inspections, make arrangements to hire lawyers or fulfill other duties of a buyers’ agent, would “significantly reduce the costs associated with home transactions.”Even as technology expands further into the real estate industry, Piskorski said he thinks a fully automated process, such as an Amazon marketplace for buying and selling homes, is still far in the distance.The real estate market, he said, is “too complex to be completely automated on a computer.”Juncosa said as the industry adjusts to the settlement rules, agents will become more like consultants throughout the home buying process, offering value-add insight. Yet what ultimately differentiates a travel agent from a real estate agent is the value and risk associated with the purchase.Purchasing a home is a major life decision, and some people will always benefit from the assurance of a broker, Juncosa said.A key point of home buying is the behavioral aspect, Piskorski said. “Some households just want a human being to be with them, to assure them that this is the right decision,” he said.Ultimately, Juncosa said that agents serve a fundamentally human purpose: reassuring homebuyers about the biggest financial decisions of their lives."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "A New York state judge on Monday denied a motion to dismiss a lawsuit against several social media companies alleging the platforms contributed to the radicalization of a gunman who killed 10 people at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York in 2022, court documents show.“The Court has determined the complaint sufficiently pleads viable causes of action to go forward at this stage of the litigation,” said Erie County Supreme Court Justice Paula Feroleto.In her decision, the judge said that the plaintiffs may proceed with their lawsuit, which claims social media companies — like Meta, Alphabet, Reddit and 4chan — ”profit from the racist, antisemitic, and violent material displayed on their platforms to maximize user engagement,” including the time then 18-year-old Payton Gendron spent on their platforms viewing that material.Attorneys for the social media companies named in the lawsuit filed a motion to dismiss saying the companies are akin to message boards containing third-party content, court documents show.“However, plaintiffs contend the defendants’ platforms are more than just message boards,” the court document says. “They allege they are sophisticated products designed to be addictive to young users and they specifically directed Gendron to further platforms or postings that indoctrinated him with ‘white replacement theory’,” the decision read.“It is far too early to rule as a matter of law that the actions, or inaction, of the social media/internet defendants through their platforms require dismissal,” said the judge.CNN has reached out to Meta for comment.YouTube Spokesperson José Castañeda provided a statement to CNN expressing sympathy for the victims and families of the attack and saying that YouTube has invested in technology and policies to identify and remove extremist content.“While we disagree with today’s decision and will be appealing, we will continue to work with law enforcement, other platforms, and civil society to share intelligence and best practices,” the statement said.In a statement to CNN, Reddit said, “Hate and violence have no place on Reddit. Our sitewide policies explicitly prohibit content that promotes hate based on identity or vulnerability, as well as content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or group of people. We are constantly evaluating ways to improve our detection and removal of this content, including through enhanced image-hashing systems, and we will continue to review the communities on our platform to ensure they are upholding our rules.”Reddit plans to appeal the decision, a spokesperson confirmed.CNN’s Olesya Dmitracova contributed to this report"

        "title": "The Chevrolet Corvette is officially going electric",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.Reuss didn’t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. “We will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,” he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only.While Reuss’s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it’s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model.“Electrified” is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as “electrified.” It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car.Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla’s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production.Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn’t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though.To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels.Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari’s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035."

        "title": "Don Lemon says Elon Musk canceled his deal with X after ‘tense’ interview",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Don Lemon said Wednesday that his partnership with Elon Musk went down in flames, hours after the former CNN anchor conducted an interview last week with the erratic billionaire for the debut episode of his new independent web-based show.“Elon publicly encouraged me to join X with a new show, saying I would have his ‘full support,’” Lemon said in a statement, adding that he took Musk at his word that he was “interested in working directly with diverse voices.”In an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett on Wednesday night, Lemon spoke about his exchange with Musk and shared video excerpts from the 90 minute sit-down, in which Lemon asked Musk questions on an array of topics.Lemon said he pressed Musk about the rise in hate speech on X since the billionaire took over the social media platform last year, asking him if he believed that he and the company had a responsibility to moderate hateful content.“I don’t have to answer questions from reporters, Don,” Musk replied. “The only reason I’m doing this interview is because you’re on the X platform and you asked for it. Otherwise, I would not do this interview.”Lemon also asked Musk about a recent meeting he held with former President Donald Trump. CNN previously confirmed the meeting with Musk, one of several Trump held with donors in Palm Beach in recent weeks as he seeks to raise more money for his financially strained campaign.“I was at a breakfast at a friend’s place and Donald Trump came by. That’s it,” Musk said, adding that Trump did “most of the talking.”Musk said Trump, who is facing more than a half a billion dollars in civil judgments and multiple criminal cases playing out in the courts, did not ask him for money. Musk said he was “not paying his legal bills in any way shape or form.”Lemon also brought up Musk’s open use of the drug ketamine, asking the SpaceX founder if he believed it posed a problem for his government security clearance. Musk, Lemon said, answered no because he has a prescription for the drug.In his statement on social media, Lemon said the sit-down he conducted with Musk for the first episode of “The Don Lemon Show,” which will be released Monday on social media platforms including X and YouTube, was “respectful and wide ranging” and that “there were no restrictions on the interview that he willingly agreed to.”“His commitment to a global town square where all questions can be asked and all ideas can be shared seems not to include questions of him from people like me,” Lemon added.In a video posted on his social media Wednesday, Lemon took further aim at Musk’s claim to be a “free speech absolutist.”“Throughout our conversation I kept reiterating to him, although it was tense at times, I thought it was good for people to see our exchange,” Lemon said. “But apparently free speech absolutism doesn’t apply when it comes to questions about him from people like me.”While the interview is not yet public, a person familiar with the matter said Musk was miffed when Lemon questioned him on his use of the drug ketamine, his government security clearance, and the issue of antisemitism.In a statement, X defended Musk’s decision to pull the plug on its agreement with Lemon.“The Don Lemon Show is welcome to publish its content on X, without censorship, as we believe in providing a platform for creators to scale their work and connect with new communities,” the company said in a statement. “However, like any enterprise, we reserve the right to make decisions about our business partnerships, and after careful consideration, X decided not to enter into a commercial partnership with the show.”Asked by a user on X what led to the decision, Musk attacked Lemon and CNN, which is not involved in Lemon’s new venture.“His approach was basically just ‘CNN, but on social media’, which doesn’t work, as evidenced by the fact that CNN is dying,” Musk wrote. “And, instead of it being the real Don Lemon, it was really just [former CNN chief] Jeff Zucker talking through Don, so lacked authenticity.”But a spokesperson for Lemon told CNN that the media personality expects Musk to honor the financial terms of the agreement.“Don has a deal with X and expects to be paid for it,” the spokesperson said. “If we have to go to court we will.”Lemon technically had not inked a contract with X, people familiar with the matter told CNN. But contracts do not necessarily have to be signed to be legally binding, particularly if it is clear each side had arrived at a mutual understanding. And according to the people close to the matter, Lemon’s camp is confident that a deal had effectively been struck, as evidenced by the fact that X had touted the deal in public announcements earlier this year. Moreover, Musk himself appeared to acknowledge that there had been a deal, texting Jay Sures, the UTA power agent who represents Lemon, “contract is canceled,” according to people familiar with the matter.The deal’s implosion comes after Musk urged Lemon to launch a show on his platform, writing last year on X: “It’d be great to have [MSNBC host] Rachel Maddow, Don Lemon & others on the left put their shows on this platform. No exclusivity or legal docs required! You will receive our full support. The digital town square is for all.”In another post, Musk directly appealed to Lemon: “Have you considered doing your show on this platform? Maybe worth a try. Audience is much bigger.”Musk has claimed to believe in free speech absolutism, but he has repeatedly taken steps to limit the speech of critics. The billionaire has at times suspended journalists from his platform and filed lawsuits against watchdogs for publishing reports critical of X.While Musk frequently launches ugly attacks on journalists and traditional news organizations, he has simultaneously elevated conspiracy theories and extremist rhetoric.Last year, Musk endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory, which resulted in droves of advertisers fleeing X. Only then, days afterward, did Musk publicly express remorse for his actions.Lemon was ousted from CNN last year, in a decision that the longtime anchor said left him “stunned.” No specific reason was given by CNN for Lemon’s dismissal, but it came after he was widely criticized for making sexist comments about then-GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley. Lemon apologized for the remarks at the time, saying, “When I make a mistake, I own it. And I own this one as well.”This story has been updated with statements posted on X and additional context."

        "title": "Ben Shapiro’s The Daily Wire severs ties with Candace Owens after her embrace of antisemitic rhetoric",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The Daily Wire, the right-wing media outlet co-founded by Ben Shapiro, said Friday that it had severed ties with Candace Owens, the far-right commentator who has ignited a torrent of backlash in recent months for her repeated embrace of antisemitic rhetoric.“Daily Wire and Candace Owens have ended their relationship,” Jeremy Boreing, the chief executive of Daily Wire, said in a statement posted online.Owens confirmed the news in her own post, writing, “The rumors are true — I am finally free.”Owens, a popular commentator notorious for promoting misinformation and conspiracy theories on a wide range of topics from vaccines to immigrants, joined The Daily Wire in 2021. The online outlet has stood by her over the years, despite her penchant for trafficking in extremist and dishonest rhetoric.But since the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel, Owens has repeatedly waded into antisemitic waters as she fiercely criticized Israel, suggesting the Jewish government was committing “genocide” in Gaza and claiming there is a sinister “small ring” of Jewish people in Hollywood and Washington, DC involved in something “quite sinister.”In November, Shapiro, who is Jewish, called out Owens for her “disgraceful” rhetoric, blasting her “faux sophistication” on the topic.Without directly naming Shapiro, Owens responded that one “cannot serve both God and money,” a brazen dig at The Daily Wire co-founder that was drenched in an age-old antisemitic trope.At the time, Shapiro hit back, “Candace, if you feel that taking money from The Daily Wire somehow comes between you and God, by all means quit.”Owens then attacked Shapiro in an interview with Tucker Carlson, the right-wing extremist who was fired last year from Fox News, accusing him of “ad hominem attacks.”In recent days, Owens has continued to generate more controversy, liking a post on X in which a user accused a rabbi of being “drunk on Christian blood.”Owens’ behavior earned her the praise of those pushing hatred of the Jewish community, which the Anti-Defamation League noted Thursday when it blasted her for pushing “an antisemitic agenda” and fueling “the fire of hate.”Owens responded by accusing the ADL of having “turned their smear merchant guns” on her.“Their attacks will have the opposite desired effect,” Owens said. “Awaken world.”While Owens will no longer have a home at The Daily Wire, she still maintains a large platform. Her extremist commentary has catapulted her to fame in right-wing circles and she boasts millions of followers across her various social media accounts. In September, she was suspended from YouTube for her anti-LGBTQ commentary after violating the platform’s rules on hate speech.Owens has long been a supporter of former President Donald Trump, amplifying his culture warrior rhetoric to her younger, online audience. “I truly believe that Donald Trump isn’t just the leader of the free world, but the savior of it as well,” she wrote in a social media post in 2018.Last month, she was photographed with Trump at a UFC event in Las Vegas. “It’s fight night,” she wrote in a photo caption. “Fighters only.”The Daily Wire’s slate of hosts are no stranger to controversy and have frequently promoted anti-LGBTQ themes and tropes. Matt Walsh, another extremist commentator employed by the Nashville-based company, has demonized gay and transgender people on his program, calling for doctors who perform gender affirming care to be imprisoned or executed."

        "title": "EU leaders endorse plan to tap frozen Russian assets to arm Ukraine",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "European Union leaders have endorsed a proposal to use windfall profits on frozen Russian financial assets to assist Ukraine, including spending as much as $3 billion a year on arms and ammunition for the country.The leaders agreed Thursday to further develop the plan presented by the European Commission. The EU will now need to come up with mechanisms to deliver the aid that take account of misgivings among some militarily neutral member states such as Austria, Ireland and Malta.“We are determined to act very quickly,” Charles Michel, who chairs the council of EU leaders, said at a press conference late Thursday.The proposal goes further than a previous EU plan — crafted in late 2023 and agreed in principle last month — to use the interest payments and other profits accumulating in accounts in Brussels to help rebuild Ukraine.A “growing majority” of European countries were “pleading” for these profits to be used for the European Peace Facility, a senior EU official told reporters Tuesday. The facility was launched in 2021 to finance the EU’s defense and military measures globally. Unlike the general EU budget, it can be used to buy arms.Pressure on EU states to do more to support Ukraine militarily has increased in recent months as the flow of aid from the United States has stalled and Russia has made advances on the battlefield.The US Senate approved a supplemental bill last month that would have unlocked $60 billion of military aid for Ukraine, but House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson refused to bring it to the floor for a vote.“I’m glad that (EU) leaders endorsed our proposal to use the extraordinary revenue from immobilized Russian assets,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday, hailing “strong support” among the leaders for using the cash for weapons.She said money could start flowing by July 1.But the shift in focus to directly supporting Ukraine’s military rather than using the funds to help rebuild the country is hard to swallow for neutral EU member states such as Ireland and Austria.Before Thursday’s EU summit, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer told reporters: “There must be a guarantee that money, for which we give our approval, is not spent on weapons and ammunition.”Speaking to reporters later, he said it was now up to EU officials to come up with ways of using the cash while respecting the position of neutral states.After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Western countries froze nearly half of Moscow’s foreign reserves — some €300 billion ($327 billion). Around €200 billion ($218 billion) sits in the EU — mostly at Euroclear, a financial institution that keeps assets safe for banks, exchanges and investors.Euroclear is accumulating vast amounts of cash because of payments associated with frozen Russian assets. These payments include, for example, interest paid on bonds, known as coupons, or the proceeds generated by securities that mature and are reinvested.Last month, the group said it had earned €5.2 billion ($5.6 billion) in interest on income generated by sanctioned Russian assets since they were frozen by EU and Group of Seven countries in 2022.The proposal by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, would involve using a special levy to collect the windfall interest income on frozen Russian assets. According to EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, the revenue generated from these immobilized assets will be around €3 billion ($3.3 billion) a year.“I hope that we can reach an agreement soon, and change banknotes into weapons… soldiers don’t fight with banknotes,” Borrell told reporters in Brussels Wednesday. “They need physical arms, they need physical instruments in order to defend (their) people.”The EU and its allies are determined to make Russia foot part of the colossal bill for rebuilding Ukraine, which official figures published by the European Commission in February put at $486 billion over the next decade.Ukrainian authorities estimate the country will need around $15 billion this year alone to rebuild energy and transport infrastructure, as well as housing, among other priorities.Separately, the EU agreed a €5 billion ($5.5 billion) top-up of the European Peace Facility Monday, ringfenced in a dedicated Ukraine Assistance Fund, which will also support the country’s military needs.James Frater and Benjamin Brown contributed reporting."

        "title": "More employers now say they’re willing to hire workers without a college degree. But is that playing out?",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "For decades, not having a college degree has often been a barrier for workers seeking a higher-level, better-paying job. But more employers are now saying they’re willing to hire them.College degrees were used by companies as a proxy for skills and competence when evaluating potential hires — making it very difficult for lower-wage, non-degreed workers even to be considered.A majority of US workers have had to contend with that barrier. Only 37.7% of Americans ages 25 and up had a bachelor’s degree in 2022, according to the US Census Bureau.But employers are now — at least publicly — becoming more open to the idea of skills-based hiring, which focuses on a job candidates’ competencies and capacity to learn new skills rather than on their educational background.Why the change of heart? There are several factors. But lurking over all of them is a demographic reality: The falling US birth rate will produce fewer workers in the years ahead to replace the number of workers retiring.Additionally, employers are increasingly aware that the skills needed to do many jobs don’t necessarily require a four-year degree, and that competent workers can be trained in needed skills as they arise.President Joe Biden, in his State of the Union speech Thursday night, acknowledged the need for skills-based hiring more than once, noting that “private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America — creating tens of thousands of jobs, many of them paying over $100,000 a year, and don’t require a college degree.” He also said he is “connecting businesses and high schools so students get hands-on experience and a path to a good-paying job, whether or not they go to college.”At a Fortune conference in October last year, Ken Frazier, the former CEO of Merck, noted that roughly three-quarters of Black adults do not have college degrees, yet the vast majority of openings at leading US companies required college degrees “for almost any job.”What’s more, since George Floyd’s murder in 2020, there has been a push to improve diversity and equity in company workforces. That means the lack of college degrees can’t be ignored, since Blacks and Hispanics are least likely to have a bachelor’s degree. In 2022, only 27.6% of Black adults and 20.9% of Hispanics had one, compared to nearly 41.8% of non-Hispanic White population, according to Census data.After Floyd’s murder, Frazier co-founded the group OneTen. Its goal is to help non-degreed Black workers find better jobs with family-sustaining pay, as defined by the MIT Living Wage Calculator. OneTen’s mission has since grown to include all workers without four-year degrees, and the group has pulled together a coalition of more than 70 leading US corporations from Accenture to Yum! Brands and talent development firms that support OneTen’s mission of closing the opportunity gap for those without degrees.So far, the group has played a matchmaking role for employers in the hiring and promotion of 108,000 non-degreed workers, said OneTen CEO Debbie Dyson at the same Fortune event. She also noted its career marketplace platform has 23,000 profiles of non-degreed job seekers and those seeking training, which is a talent pool that employers can search.OneTen’s hand in more than 100,000 job advancements is notable, but it is still well below the group’s goal of 1 million hires and promotions of non-degreed workers within 10 years.That may reflect what one recent study found: Not all employers who talk about skills-based hiring and remove degree requirements from job ads are actually hiring candidates without degrees.“[F]or all its fanfare, the increased opportunity promised by skills-based hiring has borne out in not even 1 in 700 hires last year,” wrote the authors of a report from Harvard Business School and the Burning Glass Institute.Directionally, however, the signs are encouraging. The report’s authors note that the 37% of companies in its sample that did follow through on their skills-based hiring commitment are already seeing benefits.“[D]espite the limited progress to date, our analysis shows that, for those who embrace it, skills-based hiring … yields tangible, measurable value. Skills-based hiring boosts retention among non-degreed workers hired into roles that formerly asked for degrees,” they said.Candidates hired into those roles received a 25% pay increase on average, the researchers added.“If the arc of corporate practice bends toward profitability, the win-win that skills-based hiring represents is an opportunity firms are remiss to ignore,” the authors wrote.In the meantime, the Federal Reserve banks of Philadelphia and Cleveland created an interactive tool called the Occupational Mobility Explorer that was released at the end of 2020.The tool is aimed at lower-wage workers without college degrees. It helps them identify better-paying occupations that have overlap with the skills required in their current positions.For example: A cashier in the Cincinnati metro area might consider a job first as a customer service representative, then move on to the role of police or fire station dispatcher and later transition to becoming a human resource specialist or legal assistant. The strong skills overlap between cashiers and customer service reps include customer service, communication skills and retail industry knowledge. From there, the skills commonly required of customer service reps and dispatchers include customer service, communication and problem solving. And so on. With each move, the former cashier’s pay could increase considerably. (The pay data in the tool still reflects 2020 pay levels, but it will be updated later this year, according to a spokesperson for the Philadelphia Fed.)The tool can be an eye-opener not just for job seekers but also employers when it comes to seeing what skills non-degreed workers from various occupations bring to the table.“It’s a good illustration of how skills gained in prior jobs can be used to move up the career ladder,” said Keith Wardrip, senior community development research adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia."

        "title": "Sam Altman returns to OpenAI in a bizarre reversal of fortunes",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry.“We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo.“We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said.In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm’s “strong partnership” with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker’s biggest financial backer.The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving.The details of Altman’s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently “candid” with the board.That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman’s ouster was the presence of tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis.As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO.But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company’s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company’s board didn’t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO.It’s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman’s return. Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work … I’m glad to have been a part of the solution.”Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X.Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision.And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades.“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”Altman’s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out.Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he has pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly.“Is [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?” he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. “Or is it gonna be more like the atom bomb — huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?”But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit.Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI’s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft’s products.OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly been in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone.— CNN’s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting."

        "title": "Judge tosses DOJ suit against social media influencers in alleged pump-and-dump scheme",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "A federal judge has dismissed a criminal indictment against seven Twitter users and a podcaster accused of running a $100 million stock manipulation scheme over social media.The Justice Department did not do enough to describe the influencers’ activities as a “scheme to defraud,” wrote District Judge Andrew Hanen of the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas, in an order dated Wednesday.In the indictment, the DOJ had alleged a lucrative “pump and dump” scheme in which the social media influencers used the messaging app Discord to promote certain stocks to their followers before selling their positions after a run-up in the stocks’ prices. The result was an alleged conspiracy by defendants “to unlawfully enrich themselves by pumping and dumping securities … through false and misleading posts and material omissions on Twitter [and Discord].”At least one of the defendants whose account CNN previously reviewed had tweeted about Gamestop and AMC, two so-called “meme stocks” that saw significant public interest and trading in 2021.On Wednesday, however, Hanen wrote that while the defendants may well have intended to separate followers from their money, the evidence did not support a finding of actual securities fraud or conspiracy to commit fraud.“The key question is whether one statement by one of the co-defendants that ‘we’re robbing … idiots of their money,’ which is alleged in the Indictment, is sufficient,” the judge wrote. “This statement sufficiently alleges ‘intent to defraud’ … but does not on its own sufficiently allege that Defendants executed, or conspired to execute, a ‘scheme to defraud’ investors of money or property” as defined by court precedent.Unlike a traditional fraud case, Hanen added, the DOJ merely claimed investors were deprived of relevant market information — not that the influencers directly stole money from investors.The indictment was dismissed without prejudice, meaning charges could potentially be amended and refiled.The DOJ case is distinct from a civil suit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission around the same time against those same defendants and that accused them of violating US securities law. The SEC’s case is currently on hold, after the Justice Department asked the court in January 2023 to stay that lawsuit while its own criminal case against the defendants unfolded.The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified the plaintiff in the case. It is the Justice Department. The photo has also been replaced."

        "title": "Top soccer clubs are using an AI-powered app to scout future stars",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to “democratize” talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app.Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them.Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch.The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills.“We’re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts’] time,” said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app.“To say [to scouts], ‘Go over to this place today because there’s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard’ — that’s going to be the best use of your time.’”It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract with EPL team Bournemouth in 2021.Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app — which fully launched in September 2023 — according to Felton-Thomas.Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year.Felton-Thomas said the “lion’s share” of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for “tier one” sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid.The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at $2.7 billion in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research.Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods.“It’s more about evolution than revolution,” Felton-Thomas explained.“We can’t tell you when that player’s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he’s 2-0 down? What happens when someone’s shouting at him? What happens when he’s just made a massive mistake?”“We’ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you’re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.”While football remains ai.io’s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports.“You think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,” Felton-Thomas told CNN."

        "title": "A market mystery: Why do capers come in such tiny jars?",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "There are certain bad design decisions that seem to persist for no good reason. Like when you buy a pair of scissors but can’t get to them because they’re trapped inside a hard plastic shell that requires scissors to open. Or the Apple mouse, with its port on the underside, rendering it unusable while charging.These frustrations don’t make a product bad, per se; they’re just irksome. The kind of little frictions that make you think, Why’d they do that?No standard spoon can fit inside the narrow openings of the typical glass caper jar. Dumping them out risks loss of essential brine. Even if you do have a supremely tiny utensil to fish them out, there’s no single-dip solution: At best you can capture three or four in one go, and any piccata recipe or lox spread worth its salt calls for, like, at least a dozen capers. Why, dear God, why do they do that?This is a story about one of modern life’s least consequential but most acutely annoying experiences: getting a sufficient number of capers out of those dollhouse-size jars they’re sold in.The short, unsatisfying answer? Capers are expensive, so producers sell them in smaller jars to make each unit more affordable. But the reason for tall jars instead of squat ones is a longer story.For the uninitiated, capers are the unripened, pea-sized buds of the prickly caper bush, or Capparis spinosa. Let them ripen, and you get caper berries, which are sort of like olives. The caper bush is a hardy shrub, happiest when rooted on a rocky cliff under a hot Mediterranean sun.Straight off the vine, capers are terribly bitter. But someone, somewhere (likely hundreds of years ago), got it in their heads to take that practically inedible drying them out in a boatload of sea salt and then rehydrating them could make for a tasty ingredient.Once they’re cured and pickled, capers become perfect little salt bombs to drop into a niçoise salad or a chicken piccata. It’s not illegal to order a lox bagel in New York City without capers, but it should be.A definitive explanation for the svelte glass jar that they come in is hard to come by. Major caper purveyors Cento and Goya did not respond to requests for comment.Reddit threads on the subject tend to upvote the theory that the tall, skinny glass jars keep the capers fresh by ensuring they stay submerged in their brine.Russell Zwanka, the director of the food marketing program at Western Michigan University, echoed that as a plausible theory.“I do understand the frustration of a spoon not fitting, and I don’t have an answer for that,” Zwanka said. “I don’t know why you can’t make it just another half an inch bigger.”There is another, more profit-focused theory. It’s courtesy of Jeff Mezzetta, the president of the privately owned California food label Mezzetta (which sells its capers in a variety of jar sizes, all with enough clearance for a regular teaspoon).Skinny jars just look nicer, Mezzetta says.After all, there’s little practical value to the skinny jar. In fact, it’s far less practical, from the producers’ standpoint.“The taller and the thinner the jar, the more difficult it is to package — because they’re tippy on the production lines, and with the smaller opening, they’re harder to get into the jar,” said Mezzetta, a connoisseur so passionate about the garnish that he even named his dog, a black Labrador, Caper.His take: “It’s primarily because some marketer feels that they’re going to look more elegant on the shelf.”There are sound economics behind that theory.Food packaging does a lot of different things, Zwanka says. It of course keeps food fresh, prevents waste and makes sure the product can be shipped efficiently.“But we also want to make sure that products are affordable,” he said.Because capers are expensive — and not exactly a staple of the American refrigerator, although sales are rising, according to Mezzetta — food companies opt for smaller jars to keep down the per-unit cost for consumers.Zwanka notes a similar packaging dilemma with saffron, one of the world’s most expensive spices. When you buy it at the grocery store, it’s perhaps disheartening to see a few tiny strings packed into the jar for $18.“You need the jar so it’ll fit in the in the spice rack,” he says. “But you also couldn’t fill that jar, or it would be $200.”If you’re only using a few capers a year, a tiny jar that can live unobtrusively in the fridge makes sense for most people. Prices vary, but a 3-ounce jar runs you about $4 at the grocery store.Still, you might wonder: Why is it a that jar so tall and narrow you need a nail file to stab at the tiny green orbs?Blame the success of Skinny Can Chic.Strolling down the soda aisle lately, you’ll notice that beverage cans have slimmed down, squeezing the same 12 ounces of fluid into a more slender package.“Consumers see slim cans as more sophisticated, which makes them feel more sophisticated,” Duane Stanford, the editor of industry trade publication Beverage Digest, told CNN last year.The same thing is happening in the beer aisle, Zwanka notes.“They’ve all adapted what you would consider the Red Bull can, because Red Bull kind of started it. But now anybody who wants to signify that it is thinner, lighter, less calories, maybe healthier … they put it thinner cans.”Labor costs are the main reason capers cost more than you might expect from what is essentially a pickled weed. The vast majority of the capers at the grocery store are grown in the wild in places like Morocco, Tunisia, Greece and Turkey, and they are picked by hand.“It takes you an hour to pick a kilo, if you’re very fast,” says Brian Noone, who runs a wholesale caper plant nursery in Adelaide, South Australia. “The other problem is, people tend to think the smaller ones taste better…But it’s a lot more work to get the smaller ones,” which are called “non-pareils.”Once they get to your kitchen, there are a number of hacks for getting them out of the jar.A Reddit page on the universally frustrating process is titled: “getting capers out of those stupid f*cking narrow jars.”Among the tips and tricks offered by Redditors:Try a a long metal bar spoon or a half-teaspoon measuring spoon. Other common utensil suggestions: An old fashioned potato peeler, chef’s tweezers, a tiny melon baller, a wide-mouth boba straw.“I use a tiny fork. Like the kind for shrimp cocktail or crab,” offers one user.“Korean dessert fork for me! It’s a tiny fork head on a long chopstick-shaped handle,” says another.But perhaps there’s no solution quite as simple as going all in — and dumping them all out.As one Redditor said: “I’ve never been in a situation where I don’t decide to just use the entire tiny jar for what I’m making.”"

        "title": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day this year",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one.Put another way, to make 12 months’ worth of a man’s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months.In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign.That’s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today.The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity.The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women.And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field.But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women’s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women.Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues.While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time — for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year’s — the very fact that ﻿such a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women’s contributions at work.“The gender wage gap is a national disgrace,” said Jamila Taylor, IWPR’s president and CEO, in a statement. “Even in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it’s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.”The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs.There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates’ for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions.But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times.For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, “bar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work … [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.”Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming."

        "title": "The average tax refund is over $3,000. Here are 7 ways to put it to good use",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS.Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there’s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you’re also owed a refund from your state government.That money may feel like a windfall, and it’s easy to squander it on a lot of little things.But if you’re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you’ll enjoy the seventh the most.If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down.At such sky-high rates, “the debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,” said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients.Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people’s awareness of how much money they’re paying in interest over time doesn’t always register.“What I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they’re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. … They don’t understand how much interest they’re paying,” Russ said.For example, if you’re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 — and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com’s calculator.You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund.When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don’t have at least three months’ worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000.Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks.If you have high-rate debt and you’re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund.Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you’re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job — such as on your car — he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt.If you’re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you’re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. “It can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,” Russ said.You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you’re saving yourself an extra 7% ﻿or so in interest on the portion of the principal you’re paying down, Bronnenkant noted.If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you’re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years.(And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older.Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great. But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, ﻿Bronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2.(For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.)Speaking of retirement savings, if you’re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier.Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have.For instance, say you’re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000).“You want to get the max match from your employer,” Bronnenkant said.If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds.The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds.But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you’re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance.If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live.Unless you’re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy.“Sometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,” Russ said. “You can set aside some of the money to have fun.”"

        "category": "business",
        "text": "The House Education Committee formally requested a wide range of documents from the University of California, Berkeley on Tuesday as part of lawmakers’ growing investigation of antisemitism on college campuses.In a letter to UC Berkeley leaders, Rep. Virginia Foxx, the Republican chair of the committee, said lawmakers are investigating the school’s “response to antisemitism and its failure to protect Jewish students.”“We have grave concerns about the inadequacy of UC Berkeley’s response to antisemitism on its campus,” Foxx wrote, citing a list of incidents that have taken place since the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel.In a statement, UC Berkley told CNN: “UC Berkeley has long been committed to confronting antisemitism, and to supporting the needs and interests of its Jewish students, faculty, and staff.”UC Berkeley joins a growing list of universities drawing Congressional scrutiny.Foxx’s committee has previously requested documents from Harvard University, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Foxx previously said Harvard has “absolutely failed” to comply with her committee’s unprecedented subpoena for documents to that Ivy League school.The letter to UC Berkeley on Tuesday gives the school until April 2 to turn over a trove of documents, including reports on antisemitic incidents since early 2021; disciplinary action; minutes from meetings of UC leaders; and information on foreign donations.Last month, protestors at UC Berkeley disrupted an event where a former Israel Defense Forces member was set to speak by banging on and shattering glass to an auditorium, according to videos posted on social media. UC Berkeley said at the time it launched an investigation into the incident.Hannah Beth Schlacter, an MBA student at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, accused the university last month at a congressional roundtable event of fostering an environment where Jewish students are not given equal opportunity to learn and participate in activities.“When you do not call out hate against Jews based on shared ancestral identity, that sends the message to other students on campus that it is okay, socially acceptable, tolerated behavior to actively hate Jews on campus,” she said.CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald and Samantha Delouya contributed to this report."

        "text": "Searches for virtual private networking (VPN) software briefly spiked in Texas this week after Pornhub suspended service in the state over a law forcing adult websites to verify the age or identities of their users.The four-fold rise in Google searches for tools that can circumvent the state-level blocking suggests the law may already be having unintended side effects, days after a federal appeals court upheld the legislation and said it could remain in effect.Visitors with Texas IP addresses who visit Pornhub’s website are now presented with a full-page message calling the Texas law “ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous.”“Until the real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in Texas,” the message reads. “In doing so, we are complying with the law, as we always do, but hope that governments around the world will implement laws that actually protect the safety and security of users.”Search interest in VPNs began disproportionately rising in Texas Thursday compared to the rest of the country, according to a CNN analysis of Google Trends data — quadrupling in the hours following Pornhub’s announcement before retreating slightly by early Friday morning.While Google Trends merely shows correlations between events and is only useful as a gauge of relative search interest for a given snapshot of time, the immediacy of the search spike, coupled with its concentration from within Texas, highlights the potential connection between the law and Pornhub’s users.A link “seems pretty likely,” said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights advocacy group.“The apparent spike in VPN searches in Texas shows that these types of age verification laws aren’t just unconstitutional, they’re also silly and ineffective,” Greer said. “Just like millions of people in countries like China, Russia and Turkey evade their government’s draconian online censorship regimes using simple tools like VPNs, now we see Texans doing the same to get around their own state government’s invasive rules.”The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), another digital rights group, said Texas is not the only state to see such searches rise in response to age verification laws.“Similar search spikes have been reported after other states passed age verification laws, which EFF opposes,” said Hudson Hongo, a spokesperson for the group. “No one should have to hand over their driver’s license just to access free websites.”Pornhub has pulled out of multiple states in response to a wave of age verification laws sweeping the country, including in Montana, Utah, Virginia and others. It also highlights the running debate in statehouses nationwide about how and whether governments can require websites to perform age verification.The law in question in Texas is known as HB 1181. It requires adult websites to implement “reasonable age verification” methods to ensure that pornography is not being distributed to minors. Those methods include either requiring users to submit “proof of identity” such as a government-issued ID to the adult website or to a third-party contractor, or by submitting other personal data to a third-party contractor, such as biometric information, that enables the vendor to check a user’s age.Last summer, a US district judge temporarily blocked the law, finding that it was overly broad, likely violated the First Amendment and threatened marginalized communities.“It runs the risk that the state can monitor when an adult views sexually explicit materials and what kind of websites they visit,” wrote Judge David Alan Ezra in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas. “Given Texas’s ongoing criminalization of homosexual intercourse, it is apparent that people who wish to view homosexual material will be profoundly chilled from doing so if they must first affirmatively identify themselves to the state.”Later, however, in response to an emergency appeal by Texas officials, the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals overruled Ezra with an order that allowed the law to take effect.And last week, a three-judge panel of the same appeals court found that Ezra applied too tough a standard in reviewing the law.The 5th Circuit court’s latest decision formally lifts the injunction against the Texas law.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton posted on X Thursday celebrating Pornhub’s decision to withdraw from the state.“Sites like PornHub are on the run,” he wrote, adding: “In Texas, companies cannot get away with showing porn to children. If they don’t want to comply, good riddance.”Pornhub said in a blog post that it supports age verification but that forcing individual websites and third-party providers to handle users’ most sensitive personal information creates unreasonable privacy and security risks. Pornhub has proposed, and reiterated on Thursday, that age verification checks should be performed exclusively on a user’s device, without requiring them to send data over the internet to third parties."

        "title": "Trump is about to get $3 billion richer after deal is approved to take his company public. But it won’t solve his cash crunch",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Investors have approved a deal on Friday to make Truth Social owner Trump Media a publicly traded company.The green light from shareholders clears a major hurdle for a long-delayed merger that will generate a multi-billion dollar windfall for former President Donald Trump at a time when he’s facing immense financial and legal pressure.According to a preliminary vote total announced during the meeting, a majority of shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp. voted in favor of the deal to merge with Trump Media. The companies have indicated the merger could close as soon as early next week.The new company will be called Trump Media & Technology Group and trade under the ticker DJT, Trump’s initials. It will own Trump’s struggling social media platform Truth Social.Shareholders voted to approve Trump Media’s merger with a blank-check company, following years of legal and regulatory obstacles. Trump will own a dominant stake in a public company, with shares worth more than $3 billion at current market prices.However, experts tell CNN there are numerous practical, financial and legal reasons why this deal is unlikely to solve Trump’s imminent cash crunch.“President Trump won’t be able to monetize that stake right away,” said Matthew Kennedy, senior initial public offering market strategist at Renaissance Capital.Trump faces a Monday deadline to post a $464 million bond in New York’s civil fraud case against him or New York’s attorney general could try to seize his golf course and private estate north of Manhattan – or other assets.The good news for Trump is that there are strong incentives for shareholders to approve the merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp.If it gets the green light from shareholders, Trump stands to be the dominant shareholder, with a stake of at least 58.1%, according to filings.The merger agreement calls for Trump to own roughly 79 million shares of the new public company – and potentially tens of millions more if certain goals are hit.At Digital World’s share price of around $43 Thursday, that massive stake would be worth $3.4 billion – at least on paper. But Digital World shares were volatile Friday, and they were closed 14% lower.The merger could close swiftly.Regulatory filings indicate the companies expect to close the merger on the second business day after the shareholder vote is approved. That sets the stage for trading to begin under the new name and ticker symbol by Tuesday or Wednesday, although it could take longer, according to Kennedy.But the deal still faces legal uncertainty. There is ongoing litigation seeking to block the merger from closing.The bad news for Trump is that this stake is not as liquid as it sounds. Those paper gains would be very difficult for Trump to translate to actual cash.In fact, Trump’s shares in this company are in many ways even less liquid than his real estate holdings, according to Charles Whitehead, a law professor at Cornell Law School.First, experts say the market is drastically overvaluing Trump Media based on the company’s fundamentals.That means Trump would have a hard time dumping the stock or even pledging it as collateral.“The stock price is clearly a bubble,” Yale law professor Jonathan Macey told CNN. “No rational investor would take the stock at face value, especially if they had to hold it for any length of time.”SEC filings indicate Trump Media’s revenue amounted to just $1.1 million during the third quarter. The company posted a loss of $26 million that quarter.Not only that, but Truth Social appears to be shrinking.The number of Truth Social’s US monthly active users on iOS and Android is down 39% year-over-year, according to Similarweb data shared with CNN earlier this month. Truth Social remains much smaller than X (formerly Twitter), which is also shrinking but at a slower pace.And yet Trump Media is being valued north of $6 billion on a fully diluted basis, which includes all stocks and options that could be converted to common stock, according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida.Ritter said the current market price is hard, if not impossible, to justify.“It is grossly overvalued,” said Ritter. “It qualifies as a meme stock for which the price is divorced from fundamental value…Meme stock investors are usually buying on the basis of the greater fool theory of investing: It is overvalued today, but I hope to make money selling it to an even greater fool tomorrow at an even higher price.”But even in the unlikely event that Trump found a taker for those shares, experts say he is likely not allowed to sell or pledge that stock – at least not yet.As is typical in a deal like this, certain shareholders are subject to a lock-up period that prevents insiders from immediately selling.“No one wants to buy into a company where the largest shareholder – and really the face of the biggest product – is selling,” said Whitehead.In this case, key shareholders of Trump Media, including its management team, have agreed not to sell their common stock for six months to maintain “important stability to the leadership and governance” of the company, according to SEC filings.Not only does that lock-up agreement prevent these key shareholders from selling their stock for six months, it says they have agreed not to “lend, offer, pledge…encumber, donate” that stock during the period.If the share price stays above $12 for a period of time, it’s possible that insiders can sell or pledge their stock 150 days after the deal closes.“The lock-up is meant to stop insiders from selling immediately after the merger,” said Xavier Kowalski, a former partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel who is now a lecturer in the finance department at the University of Florida. “It also stops them from pledging the stock, like with a margin loan. So it’s going to be difficult to find a way to use those shares to get cash for now.”Moreover, there are additional lock-up restrictions contained in an amended charter that experts say appear to include Trump. That lock-up also restricts certain shareholders from immediately selling after the deal closes.“If his shares are covered by the charter’s lockup provisions then, absent an amendment to the charter, President Trump cannot pledge this stock. Full stop,” Whitehead said.And amending the charter would be tricky – even for Trump and his outsized sway over the company. That’s the kind of thing that would have to be disclosed ahead of time because it would impact potential buyers of the stock.“He can’t do this quietly. If President Trump today intends to amend the charter and they are not disclosing this intention, that’s a problem,” Whitehead said. “Presumably, they would need to take the position after the vote approving the merger that President Trump woke up and suddenly said, ‘Hey, let’s amend the charter.’”Now even if Trump overcame these potentially insurmountable obstacles, there is no guarantee any bank would take this stock as collateral in a loan.“If I’m a bank, I’m going to be troubled by the idea of a significant shareholder pledging his stake,” Whitehead said. “Any bank doing a proper credit analysis must be sensitive to the fact that this stock may very well tank if it turns out that President Trump is looking to sell down the position.”This story has been updated with additional developments and context."

        "title": "Why lab-grown diamond sales are surging",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "It’s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales.Not that you’d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag.“The result is really stunning,” said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst.He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period.Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.“The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,” he said. Too late. “It’s actually happening.”Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.“This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.“A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.”This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds.The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world’s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output.Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious.Mined diamonds have a controversial history that’s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded “conflict diamonds” that fund conflict in war-torn areas.Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot.Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small.Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world’s largest jewelry company, Pandora (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.Pandora said it’s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it.Signet, (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts.Calling it a “fast-growing category” in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don’t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it.“As the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn’t surprising,” said Don O’Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. “[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they’re conflict-free. They’re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.”Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting.There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won’t get much for it.But the value of a ring isn’t just monetary.“As a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,” said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. “I always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.”"

        "title": "This social app prohibits edited photos to encourage users to be more authentic. It’s growing fast",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Scoot over, Facebook and Instagram.There’s a newer photo-sharing app – and it’s not like other social media platforms.The app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance.We joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it.BeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users – at least 65% – have signed up this calendar year.As its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they’re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life.It has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that’s what people will see.The result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms.The concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it’s time to “BeReal.” That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you’re doing, no matter how mundane.There’s no set time – the notification comes at random times of the day – adding to the app’s mystique.“Push notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,” the company said in a statement. “It’s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it’s not random.”That means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you’re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo – a selfie and one showing what’s in front of you. (BeReal doesn’t permit videos yet.)The result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things – lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner.With only one post a day, there’s no clutter of friends’ pictures to mindlessly scroll through. You can only see friends’ posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time.Georgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August.“What I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. … solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,” says Telerski, a junior majoring in government.Telerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms.“I try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,” he says. “I think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.”When you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what’s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie.The app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you’re ready.BeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity.BeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via its college ambassador program, which allows students to host events that educate others about the app.Telerski believes the app is popular because it’s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online.“I have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,” he says.Morgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend’s suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people’s lives.“It’s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren’t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,” she says. “It’s something different.”In a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create “an alternative to addictive social networks” that focus on amassing influence, it says.“BeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,” the company says. “BeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.”The app doesn’t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos.But some users may still try to curate their lives on the app.“There is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,” Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says.“It is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,” he says. “BeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.”The young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps.Nott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal – and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well.Telerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says.“For those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,” he says.“Think about what social media was originally intended for – real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.”"

        "title": "Welcome to the market, RDDT! Reddit stock jumps on first day as a public company",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Reddit, one of the original social media companies, is finally making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday — more than a decade after many of its peers.Trading under the ticker “RDDT,” shares started trading at $47 and reached a high of $57.80 early Thursday afternoon, up as much as 70% from its initial price offering of $34. At its peak, shares of the stock had a market cap of about $10.9 billion.It’s a major milestone for the nearly 20-year-old company, something Reddit has been preparing for since at least 2021, when it hired its first chief financial officer. It also marks the first social media company to go public in years, and its performance could be a signpost for other companies considering IPOs.Funds raised from a successful IPO could help Reddit invest in key areas for growth, including building out new revenue streams as it seeks to stake a claim as a data provider for the burgeoning artificial intelligence language model industry. A successful public offering could also establish a sustainable ownership structure for a company with a history of ownership changes and leadership controversies.But its success is far from guaranteed. Reddit has never turned a profit, and by its own admission, “we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.” The company is also giving loyal users a chance to buy IPO shares, a move that’s “great for PR but practically risky,” according to Kamran Ansari, Venture Partner at investment firm Headline, because those users could cause volatility in the share price right out of the gate if they quickly sell the stock.It’s been a rough few years for the IPO market — and successful IPOs typically beget other successful listings. While 2021 was a record-breaking year for companies looking to make their public debuts on the US stock market, dealmaking on Wall Street has largely dried up since, as executives have contended with recession fears, elevated interest rates and geopolitical tensions.While IPO activity is now trending higher — there have been 23 IPOs priced so far this year, a 15% change over last year — companies that have gone public have underperformed the S&P 500 by about two percentage points, according to data from the Renaissance IPO Index.Reddit priced its shares at $34 each, valuing the company at around $6 billion, less than the $10 billion valuation the company targeted on the private market in 2021 — which may be a reminder that in the age of continued high interest rates, money now comes at a higher cost.“Reddit’s IPO marks the return of the junk IPO,” David Trainer, CEO of New Constructs, said in an email. “We think the company may never monetize its platform without angering its users and the entire premise of Reddit is user-generated content.”Still, there may be no time like the present for Reddit to go public. The social media industry is bracing for a potential shakeup if a bill that could see TikTok banned in the United States — which has already passed the House — progresses further.Some on Wall Street also believe Reddit has more room to grow, after increasing its user base by some 40% between 2021 and 2023.“There’s really substantial growth potential when it comes to certain places outside the US, particularly ones where English is a primary language. India has been highlighted, for example, as a very substantial opportunity,” said Scott Kessler, global technology sector lead at research firm Third Bridge. He added that Reddit is available in fewer than 10 languages, meaning the company could also find new growth by making the platform accessible to more users around the world.“The big challenge, of course, is not just user growth, but the related monetization,” Kessler said.Among Reddit’s plans to better monetize those users is licensing their data to help train AI models. The company recently announced an AI licensing deal with Google that’s said to be worth $60 million per year.And while the so-called “front page of the internet” certainly seems to have potential as a data source, some users appear frustrated with the idea of their content being sold off to train AI tools. And regulators have questions, too.Reddit disclosed last week that the US Federal Trade Commission is looking into its plans to license data to AI firms, although the company said it does not believe it has violated US consumer protection law."

        "title": "Trump sues ABC News and George Stephanopoulos for defamation over Nancy Mace interview",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Former President Donald Trump filed yet another lawsuit against the news media late Monday, accusing ABC News and George Stephanopoulos of defamation over assertions the anchor made in a combative interview.In an interview on “This Week,” Stephanopoulos pressed Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, a rape survivor, over her continued support of Trump after a jury found he sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $88 million for battery and defamation. Stephanopoulos asserted multiple times in the interview with Mace that Trump had “raped” Carroll.“You endorsed Donald Trump for president. Judges and two separate juries have found him liable for rape and for defaming the victim of that rape. How do you square your endorsement of Donald Trump with the testimony that we just saw?” Stephanopoulos asked Mace.The South Carolina Republican defended her support of the former president, arguing that the jury decision was merely in a civil case. “It was not a criminal court case, number one,” she told Stephanopoulos. “Number two, I live with shame. And you’re asking me a question about my political choices trying to shame me as a rape victim.”While a Manhattan federal jury last year found that Trump had sexually abused Carroll, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, the jury did not find that she proved he had raped her. Dismissing a countersuit months later, however, the judge in the case concluded that the claim Trump raped Carroll was “substantially true.”“Indeed, the jury’s verdict in Carroll II establishes, as against Mr Trump, the fact that Mr Trump ‘raped her’, albeit digitally rather than with his penis. Thus, it establishes against him the substantial truth of Ms Carroll’s ‘rape’ accusations,” Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote.Trump’s lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida, claims that Stephanopoulos’s statements were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.”A representative for ABC News did not provide an immediate comment.But Trump, who regularly demonizes the press, has a long history of filing meritless lawsuits against the news media. He was recently forced to pay $392,000 in attorney fees to The New York Times for a failed lawsuit against the newspaper."

        "title": "FCC cracks down on cable ‘junk fees’",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The US government is cracking down on cable TV “junk fees,” forcing providers to publish a single, comprehensive price — so consumers know up front exactly how much they’ll pay for services inclusive of all extra costs.The junk fees crackdown is part of a series of moves the Federal Communications Commission announced Thursday. During its monthly open meeting, the agency addressed other consumer issues, including finalizing a new cybersecurity product label for hack-resistant tech gadgets and releasing a report finding that 24 million Americans still lack high speed internet access.The new junk fees rule requires cable and satellite TV companies to list “all-in” prices to consumers in their billing and marketing materials — including any miscellaneous fees, such as those related to sports programming or local broadcast channels.Between 24% and 33% of the typical consumer’s bill can be attributed to fees, consumer advocates told the FCC.The new rule aims to help consumers comparison shop among different providers. The move could simplify what is currently a difficult process of comparing apples to oranges, the FCC said.“No one likes surprises on their bill,” said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. “The advertised price for service should be the price you pay when your bill arrives. It shouldn’t include a bunch of unexpected junk fees that are separate from the top line price you were told when you signed up.”In a report released Thursday alongside the agency’s 3-2 vote, the FCC cited a filing that Consumer Reports submitted to the agency, alleging that cable companies publicly advertise “relatively low base rates” to lure customers in before imposing “a dizzying array of other charges.”The cable industry has pushed back, saying “all-in” pricing is unnecessary and that the current practice of breaking out fees into separate line items is a more transparent approach that helps consumers.“Our members clearly disclose the specific amounts of the fees that will apply and the total amount customers will pay for service, thereby ensuring that customers are not ‘surprised by unexpected fees,’” said NCTA, a trade association representing some of the nation’s largest cable companies, in a filing to the FCC.In a separate move last year, the FCC proposed banning certain cable fees altogether, including early termination fees that the agency says hinder competition and prevent customers from easily switching providers. That proposal would also require companies to provide consumer refunds if a subscriber cancels their plan mid-month.In addition to cable, the FCC also addressed internet availability during its Thursday meeting. Tens of millions of Americans still don’t have access to high-speed home internet, the FCC added Thursday in a new report highlighting the digital divide.The problem affects more than 1 in 4 Americans, or 28%, who live in rural areas, the FCC said, and the same is true for 23% of people living on tribal lands. Overall, 7% of the country, or 24 million Americans, lack high-speed access.“It was four years ago this week that so many of us were told to go home,” said Rosenworcel, referring to the Covid-19 lockdowns of 2020. “The pandemic exposed our digital divide in living color.”The new report is based on 2022 data and first-time insights from a massive, years-long revamp of FCC coverage maps — which officials say provide radically more accurate service estimates. Previously, entire census blocks were considered served by broadband if just one household within a census block had high-speed internet, dramatically overstating the number of connected Americans.The report also reflects newly adopted revisions in how the country defines high-speed internet, which the FCC voted to approve on Thursday.The definition of high-speed home internet has not been updated since 2015, when the FCC set the threshold at a minimum download speed of 25 megabits per second and a minimum upload speed of 3 megabits per second.Thursday’s revisions set the new standard at 100 Mbps for downloads and 20 Mbps for uploads, reflecting advances in technology and how faster internet speeds have become an absolute necessity for everyday life, supporting everything from telehealth visits to remote work.The definition of broadband is more than academic; it has far-reaching implications for how the country allocates billions in federal funding for infrastructure and government aid programs.The FCC moves follow Congress’ decision to spend billions of dollars in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law to build out internet service to hard-to-reach and underserved areas. It also comes as more than 23 million low-income households are at risk of losing their internet service, or could face potential bill shock, due to the expiration this spring of a critical benefit program popular with both parties known as the Affordable Connectivity Program.Thursday’s FCC report sets a long-term goal to serve Americans everywhere with download speeds of at least 1,000 Mbps, also known as gigabit speeds, and download speeds of 500 Mbps or more.Republican members of the FCC criticized the report on connectivity and the vote to increase the definition of broadband, saying the moves appear intended to justify more regulation of internet service providers and taxpayer spending.A Biden administration plan to protect consumer electronics from hackers also received final approval on Thursday as the FCC voted unanimously to greenlight a product label that will soon appear on smart home devices, baby monitors and other common gadgets.The label, which resembles a shield and that officials compare to the Energy Star certification program that denotes energy-efficient products, is intended to help buyers pick out connected appliances that voluntarily meet rigorous cybersecurity standards.A wide range of products will be eligible for the label, including internet-connected refrigerators, washing machines, doorbell cameras and smart speakers — provided that they meet criteria published by the National Institute for Standards and Technology.Some of the participating electronics makers and retailers in the program include giants such as Logitech, LG, Samsung, Best Buy and Amazon.“You want to know that when you bring that monitor into your house to watch your newborn, that connection is secure and is not going to invite any malware or malicious activity into your home,” said Rosenworcel, the chairwoman. “I think parents everywhere feel that way.”US officials have said that consumers have their own role to play in protecting the nation from cyberattacks — and that is by making informed decisions about what tech products to buy.“Imagine you’re a mom, and you’re worried about someone taking pictures of your infant lying in a crib and posting them on the dark web,” US deputy national security advisor Anne Neuberger said during an onstage appearance this year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “Think about your home alarm system, somebody hacking into it and unlocking digital locks. Those are examples we see today.”The “US Cyber Trust Mark” label will improve the country’s baseline cybersecurity by ensuring that the most widely used tech products in America are those that have been specifically hardened against hacking, the Biden administration has said. It could also encourage competition among electronics manufacturers to offer the most secure devices on the market.Thursday’s action by the FCC establishes the Cyber Trust Mark program, plus a publicly available database that will list all the trusted products that have received the label.Neuberger has said the Biden administration is working with overseas counterparts to extend the labeling program to the European Union, and that the partnership will make US products more attractive and competitive in the EU. She has also said consumers could begin seeing the label on store shelves by the end of the year."

        "title": "Top news outlets acknowledge Hur’s characterization of Biden’s mental state didn’t match reality",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "Oops?After spending weeks breathlessly questioning President Joe Biden’s mental faculties in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Hur’s explosive report, some of America’s top news organizations on Tuesday effectively stated that Hur’s characterization of the commander-in-chief was off base.The Wall Street Journal declared that the transcripts of Biden’s deposition with Hur released on Tuesday painted “a more nuanced picture” than the report indicated. The New York Times found that Biden appeared “clearheaded,” despite having fumbled some dates. And The Washington Post concluded Biden “doesn’t come across as being as absent-minded as Hur has made him out to be.”In other words, the Hur report offered a misleading view of the president’s mental state. That’s a significant problem for news organizations, given that much of their recent coverage about Biden’s age was derived from that very report where Hur offered a wince-inducing depiction of the president as a “sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.”The acknowledgement from some, but not all, news outlets on Tuesday about the true nature of Biden’s deposition marked another embarrassing moment for the national press, which has floundered at pivotal moments in the lead up to the crucial 2024 presidential election.The deposition transcripts not only indicated that Biden appeared fairly sharp during his testimony, joking with investigators and retelling stories with granular detail, but that Hur was misleading in how he presented some of the information included in his report.As The NYT’s Charlie Savage noted on X, in one instance, “Based on a garbled moment, Hur claimed Biden forgot that the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan was an ally who shared his opposition to the surge. Hur omitted that a few minutes later, Biden brought up the ambassador again in a way that made clear he knew that.”Particularly jarring, was that at another point during the depositions, Hur actually went out of his way to praise Biden’s memory. “You have — appear to have a photographic understanding and, and recall of the house,” Hur told Biden, referencing the president’s Wilmington home.Strangely, that characterization of Biden didn’t find its way into his report — and, thus, the crush of ensuing news stories. Instead, Hur chose to portray the president as a mentally diminished elderly man who struggled to recall basic information during his deposition, raising alarm bells about whether he had the fitness to serve in the nation’s highest office.Hur’s characterization of Biden played directly into a years-long campaign waged by Biden’s political opponents and the powerful right-wing media machine to depict the president as a senile, aloof man.The special counsel’s report was something of a gift to outlets like Fox News, which used the special counsel’s characterization to validate its years of ugly attacks on Biden. Such outlets then pointed to the fact that Biden’s mental fitness was being covered by prominent news organizations, contending that the issue had grown so serious the supposed “liberal media” could no longer ignore it.To be fair to news organizations, they were faced with a thorny, difficult decision after the Hur report dropped. If they chose to dial back coverage, it could have looked like they were covering for Biden. On the other hand, leaning hard into the report, producing scores of stories and television segments about Hur’s characterization of Biden’s age, proved ultimately to be unwise as well.What news organizations can do now, however, is forcefully acknowledge that the deposition transcript poured cold water on Hur’s over-the-top characterization of Biden’s mental fitness. Given the extensive coverage in the prior weeks, which seeped into the national consciousness, it is not sufficient to only tacitly acknowledge the reality of the situation.﻿But don’t hold your breath that the news media will shout its findings from the mountain tops at the same volume and with the same vigor as it did after Hur’s report was released. While The NYT, The WaPo, The WSJ, and a few others commendably acknowledged that the deposition transcripts rendered a more nuanced picture of Biden than Hur offered in his report, other outlets did not.As Bill Grueskin, a renowned professor of professional practice at the Columbia Journalism School noted to me, “It’s very hard for someone who was involved in the coverage to critique their own methods. Because these things don’t always lend themselves to straightforward corrections, like misspelling a name. It has to do more with how a news story is framed so readers understand the incompleteness of it.”"

        "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration will take a closer look at safety at United Airlines after a string of nearly a dozen incidents this month, the airline said in a memo Friday.“Over the next several weeks, we will begin to see more of an FAA presence in our operation as they begin to review some of our work processes, manuals and facilities,” United said in a memo to employees obtained by CNN. The review means an “even closer look at multiple areas of our operation to ensure we are doing all we can to promote and drive safety compliance.”On March 15, a United Boeing 737-800 landed in Medford, Oregon, missing an external panel.While no passengers were injured, the incident was just one in a line of recent mishaps on United flights – all involving Boeing jets. In just the last month, another United Boeing plane spewed flames from an engine after taking off, one slid off the runway, one lost a wheel during takeoff, and yet another trailed hydraulic fluid.“The number of safety-related events in recent weeks have rightfully caused us to pause and evaluate whether there is anything we can and should do differently,” the United employee memo said.In a statement, the FAA said its “safety assurance system routinely monitors all aspects of an airline’s operation. It focuses on an airline’s compliance with applicable regulations; ability to identify hazards, assess and mitigate risk; and effectively manage safety.”Boeing, the manufacturer of the vast majority of the jets that United Airlines uses, is also in the spotlight following a series of dramatic incidents involving its planes. The most notable is the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 plane that lost a door plug mid-flight on January 5, leaving a hole in the side of the plane. Last week, a LATAM Airlines flight from Sydney, Australia, to Auckland, New Zealand, plunged in mid-air suddenly, causing some passengers to be injured as they were thrown to the ceiling of the cabin.Both incidents are still under investigation, but an early report from the National Transportation Safety Board found that Boeing may have left bolts off the Alaska Air jet. Boeing has suggested that the LATAM plunge may have been caused by an incident in the cockpit rather than by the plane’s controls.Still, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has said he would look into the possibility of buying more jets from Airbus, Boeing’s European competitor.- CNN’s Pete Muntean and Chris Isidore contributed to reporting."

        "text": "Things have gone from bad to worse for Adidas. After a costly break-up with US rapper Ye that helped push the German sportswear giant into a rare loss last year, it’s now suffered a bruising defeat on home turf.The German Football Association (DFB) announced Thursday that the company’s arch rival Nike (NKE) will be the official kit supplier for national soccer teams from 2027 until 2﻿034. The decision brings to an abrupt end more than seven decades of the sport’s partnership with Adidas that spanned four World Cup wins for the men’s team.In a statement, DFB President Bernd Neuendorf said German football owed “a great deal” to the partnership with Adidas and that the association was “fully committed” to achieving further joint success through the end of 2026, when their contract expires.The DFB said Nike had made “by far the best financial offer” and impressed with its vision for developing women’s football, and amateur and grassroots sport in Germany. It did not say how much the new deal was worth.An Adidas spokesperson said in a statement that “we were informed by the DFB yesterday that the federation will have a new supplier from 2027 onwards.”Germany will be the host for the Euro 2024 men’s championship, taking place this June and July. Adidas will supply the kits for seven national teams, including the German, Italian and Spanish teams.In just under three years’ time, however, fans will see Nike’s trademark ticks, not the three stripes of Adidas, on the shirts of Germany’s national teams. German economy minister Robert Habeck told local news agency DPA Friday that he could “hardly imagine” the prospect.The partnership between Adidas and German football was a “piece of German identity,” he said. “I would have liked a bit more local patriotism.” An economy ministry spokesperson confirmed his comments to CNN.Adidas was founded in 1949 in Herzogenaurach, a small town outside Nuremberg in south-east Germany, the same year it registered its now-iconic three-stripe logo.DFB’s announcement comes at a bad time for Adidas, which last week posted a net loss of €58 million ($63 million) in its core business for 2023, citing a slowdown in sales of its Yeezy-branded clothing and sneakers, and a large tax burden.It came after Adidas abandoned its lucrative nine-year partnership with Yeezy designer Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, in October 2022, after he made a string of anti-semitic remarks.“We didn’t have a great year,” chief financial officer Harm Ohlmeyer told journalists last week.Chris Stern in Berlin contributed reporting."

        "category": "business",
        "text": "Stellantis is recalling almost 285,000 Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans in the United States because they have side curtain airbag inflators that could burst, sending metal shrapnel flying through the cabin.Airbag inflators rely on a chemical reaction that produces gas that rapidly inflates the airbag. Moisture may have gotten inside inflators installed in some 2018 through 2021 Charger and 300 models in the manufacturing process. That water could lead to internal corrosion and, possibly, cracks in the inflator, according to documents Stellantis filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The Charger and 300 are large sedans that share most of their engineering. The airbag inflators involved in this recall were not installed in any other Stellantis models, according to the documents.While the situation is similar to that which led to the recall of millions of Takata airbag inflators used in many different vehicles, this problem is apparently unrelated.Beginning in early May, Stellantis will mail letters to Charger and 300 owners with cars that could have the problem. Owners will be instructed to bring their cars into a dealership to have the side airbags on both sides of the vehicles replaced. The work will be done at no charge to owners, and people who may already have had their side curtain airbags replaced will be reimbursed for the cost.Stellantis is not aware of any accidents or injuries resulting from these issues. There were five known instances in which the airbag inflators burst. In each case, they were in parked vehicles in which the interior temperature reached over 120 degrees, which it can, especially in hot weather."

        "text": "The owner of Novo Nordisk, the drugmaker that gave the world Ozempic and Wegovy, is funding a new supercomputer powered by Nvidia’s artificial intelligence technology with a key aim of discovering new medicines and treatments.The Novo Nordisk Foundation has awarded France’s Eviden a contract to build what the computing company says will be one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers, able to process vast amounts of data using AI.It should provide “unprecedented potential to accelerate groundbreaking scientific discoveries in areas such as drug discovery, disease diagnosis and treatment,” Cédric Bourrasset, Eviden’s head of quantum computing, said in a statement.The supercomputer is expected to be ready for pilot projects before the end of the year and will be housed in Denmark’s national center for AI innovation.Named Gefion, the supercomputer will be available for use by researchers from Denmark’s public and private sectors, and will enjoy the backing of two of the hottest companies in the United States and Europe.Nvidia is now one of the largest companies on the US stock market, valued at $2.21 trillion. The new supercomputer will use Nvidia’s latest chip technology.The foundation, meanwhile, has a controlling stake in Novo Nordisk (NVO), a company worth more than Tesla. Its business is booming thanks to the widespread use of its diabetes drug Ozempic for weight loss and the popularity of Wegovy, which contains the same active ingredient as Ozempic.AI’s potential to speed up scientific research was highlighted earlier this year when Microsoft (MSFT) said that a new battery material had been found “in a matter of weeks, not years.”The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy, used a Microsoft system that includes AI models and high-performance computing to winnow 32 million potential inorganic materials to 18 promising candidates in less than four days, Microsoft said in January.Writing about its collaboration with Microsoft, the PNNL said on its website: “The entire process, from receiving the simulated candidates through producing a functioning battery, took less than nine months, a blink of an eye compared with traditional methods.”"

        "text": "After no ticket matched all numbers drawn in Tuesday night’s Mega Millions lottery, anyone feeling lucky has another chance to win the jackpot, which now stands at a whopping $977 million, at the Friday drawing.To be sure, there’s nothing wrong with fantasizing about winning the grand prize, or dropping $5 to $10 to buy lottery tickets or scratch-offs on occasion. In fact, Americans spent over $113 billion on lottery tickets last year, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.However, given everyone’s dreadfully poor odds of winning big — you have a better chance of being struck by lightning — spending hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars a year in hopes of becoming a fast millionaire is a little like setting your cash on fire.If your real goal is to improve your financial situation and enjoy your life more, here are a few easy ways to do that with the same amount of money you’d spend playing your numbers — but with a guaranteed return:Let’s be real. If you’re willing to spend hundreds of bucks on lottery tickets, scratch-offs and other games of chance, you may not be psyched to redirect that money into a retirement fund, since the payoff may be decades from now.If that’s the case for you, why not spend most of your lottery money on experiences you know you like doing now.“Simply enjoy the money. Put it in a ‘fun’ fund. To go out to a fancy dinner or go on a vacation,” said personal finance educator Tiffany Aliche, founder of TheBudgetnista.com and the Live Richer Academy. “If that money is going to be gone anyway, I’d rather you have lovely experiences. Let it be gone in a way that holistically enriches your life.”If you’re carrying credit card debt, one of the best ways to leave yourself with more money is to pay off, or at least substantially pay down, your highest-interest debt. And — reality check — all credit card debt is expensive today, since rates are at record highs.So, redirecting most of your lottery-spending dollars toward that end may improve your life markedly by relieving you of some financial strain.“You’ll have more money to spend on what you enjoy,” Aliche said. Or, even if it’s not something you enjoy per se, it can help you pay for what you need, like housing.Overall, your odds of winning the big Mega Millions jackpot are very low — think 1 in 303 million — why not put most of what you usually spend on the lottery into an online high-yield savings account instead, many of which are offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35%?Think of it this way: Let’s say you spend $35 a week on lottery tickets ($1,820 a year). And, all in, maybe you win $100 over the course of a year. That means you’re out $1,720.If instead you had banked that $1,820 at 5.35%, you’d have $1,917.37 on hand instead.High-yield accounts at FDIC-insured online banks let you park money you can tap any time you need it. And when you see your balance grow through regular, automated deposits, you might grow fond of the habit.That, in turn, will put you in a better position financially, whatever your goals.— CNN’s Chris Isidore contributed to this report"

        "title": "The US economy is nowhere near a recession, Goldman Sachs’ top economist says",
        "category": "business",
        "text": "The soft landing that once looked nearly impossible for the Federal Reserve to pull off is still on track. That’s the message from Jan Hatzius, the chief economist of Goldman Sachs.“Certainly, it doesn’t look like the economy is anywhere close to a recession,” Hatzius told CNN.Even though he concedes inflation has come in hotter-than-expected so far this year, the Goldman economist is sticking by his prescient call for a soft landing.“If I look at the news flow overall over the last year, it’s still very, very positive,” Hatzius said. “Inflation has come down very substantially over that period. And more importantly, it’s come down without significant weakness in activity. We haven’t seen a recession. We haven’t been close to a recession.”To fight inflation, the Federal Reserve spiked interest rates in 2022 and 2023 at the fastest pace since the 1980s under legendary Fed chief Paul Volcker.Many feared that war on inflation would cause unemployment to surge and short-circuit the economic recovery from Covid-19. At one point in the fall of 2022, a model by Bloomberg projected a 100% risk of a US recession over the following 12 months.Now, many economists are in the soft landing camp as consumer spending and the jobs market have proven to be much more resilient than anticipated.Hatzius told CNN he’s “pretty confident” there won’t be a US recession over the next 12 months, placing just a 15% risk of a downturn. That’s more or less the average recession risk on any given year.That upbeat forecast should be a relief to those in the White House trying to sell voters on President Joe Biden’s economic message. A recession could doom that effort.Since 1900, all five president running for reelection who had a recession in the year they ran for reelection lost, according to TD Cowen Washington Research Group. (Those five presidents were William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Donald Trump.)Hatzius told CNN that inflation will likely have cooled enough by June to pave the way for the Fed to start cutting interest rates. That would help ease high borrowing costs on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards.“Our forecast and current market expectation is that the first cut comes in June, but it’s going to be data dependent,” Hatzius said.The Fed could speed up interest rate cuts if the historically-strong jobs market starts to weaken.“If we were to see more pervasive signs of labor market deterioration, I’d say it becomes more urgent to move,” Hatzius said.Even as hiring has remained sturdy, the unemployment rate climbed to 3.9% in February, up from the historic low of 3.5% as recently as July 2023.Hatzius said that if the unemployment rate moves into the low-4% range, that would make officials inside the Fed nervous enough to start pulling forward their rate cut plans.Even though recession risks have eased, there are always wildcards that could change the picture quickly.“Almost by definition, I think shocks are negative. Now what am I worried about? Geopolitics would certainly be high up on the list,” Hatzius said. “We live in a much more unstable world with military conflict, the war in Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, more tensions between the US and China.”And then there are the unknown unknowns, as Donald Rumsfeld famously phrased.“The shock that occurred four years ago was kind of the most extreme version of an unknown, unknown that we have seen in many decades, if not ever,” Hatzius said, referring to Covid.One risk that is casting a shadow over the economy is empty office buildings in the $20 trillion commercial real estate market — a problem caused in part by Covid and the rise of remote work.Yet Hatzius, like Fed Chair Jerome Powell, doesn’t think empty office buildings will sink the US economy the way toxic mortgages did in 2008.He pointed to the fact that office construction is a relatively small part of the economy and the fact that this problem is expected to play out over several years.“It’s hard to see how that would cause a recession,” Hatzius said."

        "category": "health",
        "text": "Medicare could start covering Wegovy for certain senior citizens and other beneficiaries with a history of heart disease now that the US Food and Drug Administration has approved drugmaker Novo Nordisk’s application to add cardiovascular benefits to the medicine’s label.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it has informed insurers that provide Medicare Part D drug plans that they could cover the medication after the FDA expanded the approval this month.“CMS has issued guidance to Medicare Part D plans stating that anti-obesity medications (AOMs) that receive FDA approval for an additional medically accepted indication can be considered a Part D drug for that specific use,” CMS said in a statement.Medicare is not allowed by law to cover drugs for chronic weight management, although Congress is facing pressure to change that. But if the same medication also receives FDA approval to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other major adverse cardiovascular events, it could be added to Part D formularies for people with established heart disease, the agency said.Insurers may use prior authorization – or advance approval – to ensure that Wegovy is being used for a medically accepted indication, CMS said. The FDA approval applies to adults with cardiovascular disease and who are either obese or overweight.The Wall Street Journal first reported the CMS guidance.Wegovy is one of four wildly popular – and super expensive – medications called GLP-1 receptor agonists. Two of them, Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro, are approved to treat people with diabetes. They are more likely to be covered by Medicare Part D plans and by commercial insurers for diabetes patients.But Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound were approved only as anti-obesity drugs, until the FDA’s recent expanded approval for Wegovy. So they are much less likely to be covered by insurers in commercial plans and were covered by only a few state Medicaid programs.CMS also said that states would be required to cover Wegovy in their Medicaid plans to prevent cardiovascular disease in people with obesity but could also take steps to control usage, such as requiring patients to try other medications or treatments first.Though the drugmakers provide some discounts for all four medications, their high list prices put them out of reach for many Americans. Wegovy costs $1,349 for a four-week supply, while Zepound is priced at $1,060. The list price for Ozempic is $969 for a four-week supply, and Mounjaro costs $1,069.The FDA approval was based on a 17,000-patient study that showed that people taking Wegovy had a 20% lower risk of a cardiac event than those taking a placebo.“Wegovy is now the first weight loss medication to also be approved to help prevent life-threatening cardiovascular events in adults with cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight,” Dr. John Sharretts, director of the FDA’s Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders, and Obesity, said in a news release.Although coverage of Wegovy and similar drugs could reduce other health care spending, these medications at their current prices would probably still cost the federal government more than they would save, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis released Wednesday. Some of the cost would be borne by Medicare enrollees through higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs.CNN’s Meg Tirrell contributed to this report."

        "title": "Marriage rates are up, and divorce rates are down, new data shows",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "After Covid-19 lockdowns, 2022 was a year of marriages, according to new data.The number of marriages took a dive around the start of the pandemic, numbers show. For the past two decades, the number of marriages stayed around 7 to 8 per 1,000 people a year, according to new data released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics.But in 2020, the marriage rate was down to 5.1 per 1,000 people, the data showed. The rate started to climb the next year, and by 2022, the number of marriages had reached 6.2 per capita and over 2 million in a year, according to the report.Growth in marriage rates may be due to more than just rescheduling, said Marissa Nelson, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Washington, DC.Being in lockdown together gave many couples a unique hurdle to overcome, one that made them get intentional about how they approached important things like finances, compromise and autonomy. Many people walked out of that experience with a better sense of what they need in a life partner, Nelson said.Intentionality may also be behind declining divorce rates, she added.In 2022, the divorce rate was 2.4 per 1,000 people. Although that isn’t the lowest it has ever been – in 2021, it was 2.3 – it continues a downward trend, according to the data.By comparison, the rate of divorces in 2000 was 4 per 1,000, which means the current rate is a big decline from two decades earlier.Being stuck in a home together during lockdown forced a lot of couples to face problems in their relationship head-on, Nelson said. That might have caused additional strife, or it could have helped them lay better groundwork for a stable future, she added.Changes over the past two decades may also have helped. Therapy has become more normalized, roles in marriages have become more flexible, and people are more used to talking openly about how they want their marriages to work, Nelson said.Another big change recently has been the way people enter marriages, said Ian Kerner, a licensed marriage and family therapist and CNN contributor.“In my practice over the last decade, I’ve noticed a gradual shift from the ‘romantic marriage’ to the ‘companionate marriage,’ meaning that people are increasingly choosing spouses at the outset who are more like best friends than passion-partners,” Kerner said via email.Doing so may lead to problems with attraction, but it also means those people are choosing partners based on qualities likely to promote long-term stability and satisfaction, he said in a previous CNN article.“At its bare minimum, the concept of commitment implies the experience of being bonded with another. At its very best, it means being bonded with someone who is a consistent safe and secure home base that will be there for you in the face of any adversities,” said Dr. Monica O’Neal, a Boston psychologist, in a recent CNN article."

        "title": "EPA bans last form of asbestos used in United States",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "The US Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that it is taking a “historic” step by banning ongoing uses of asbestos, which has long been linked to multiple types of cancer.The agency’s announcement of the final rule applies to chrysotile asbestos, the only form of asbestos currently being used in or imported to the United States. It is the most common type of asbestos used in the world, used in car parts such as aftermarket automotive brakes and linings and other vehicle friction products and gaskets. It’s been banned in 50 other countries.Asbestos is a thin, fibrous, naturally occurring material that is flexible and resistant to corrosion, electricity and heat. It’s inexpensive, which led manufacturers and builders to use several forms of the material in cigarette filters, hair dryers and home insulation. Manufacturers dialed back the use of asbestos once scientists determined that the fibers could easily separate into tiny particles that could be inhaled into the lungs, causing damage.While the use of asbestos has been declining for decades in the US, asbestos exposure is linked to more than 40,000 deaths in the US, according to the EPA.People who are exposed to asbestos can develop lung cancer, mesothelioma, ovarian cancer and laryngeal cancer, studies show.Calling it a “major milestone” for chemical safety “after more than three decades of inadequate protections and serious delays during the previous administration,” the EPA celebrated the change Monday.“The science is clear – asbestos is a known carcinogen that has severe impacts on public health. President Biden understands that this concern that has spanned generations and impacted the lives of countless people. That’s why EPA is so proud to finalize this long-needed ban on ongoing uses of asbestos,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.The EPA set different deadlines for different industries to transition away from asbestos.For the auto industry, for brakes, linings, other vehicle friction products and gaskets, the ban goes into effect six months after the date of the final rule, which is 60 days after it appears in the Federal Register.The chlor-alkali industry, the main source of chlorine globally, uses asbestos diaphragms to make sodium hydroxide and chlorine, which the EPA says is “critical” to disinfect drinking water and wastewater. The agency said there are other methods to produce chlorine, but the eight plants in the US that still use these asbestos diaphragms will have to find other methods to do their work. They will get at least five more years to make this transition.The American Chemistry Council, a trade association that represents companies that use asbestos products, said in a statement that its Chlorine Panel provided the EPA with data that suggested it needed a 15-year transition timeline to “support an orderly transition and to avoid a significant disruption of chlorine and sodium hydroxide supplies.” The council said it has not seen the final rule.The EPA said it will require strict workplace safety measures to protect workers’ health where there is a phaseout that is longer than two years.The AFL-CIO, the country’s largest labor federation that includes unions, applauded the EPA’s ban for providing “landmark protection” for workers.“This action once more shows the deep commitment of the Biden administration to ensure working people remain safe and healthy on the job,” the federation said in a statement. It added, though, that although it is a critical step forward, Monday’s action does not eliminate all types of asbestos fibers and does not address “legacy” asbestos through the country’s old buildings and infrastructure.“We urge the EPA to move swiftly to address those risks as well,” the AFL-CIO said.The EPA also announced Monday that it is evaluating legacy uses of asbestos and asbestos-containing talc, a super-soft mineral that is often mined alongside asbestos.Monday’s ban is something Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said is a “long overdue step forward for public health.”“However, it cannot be the end of the road when it comes to phrasing out other dangerous asbestos fibers, and Congress has a role to play here when it comes to providing stronger protections for our health,” Merkley said."

        "title": "Diet drinks may boost risk of dangerous heart condition by 20%, study says",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Drinking two liters or more per week of artificially sweetened beverages — the equivalent of a medium-sized fast-food diet soda a day — raised the risk of an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation by 20% when compared to people who drank none, a new study found.Known as A-fib, atrial fibrillation is an irregular heartbeat often described by many people who have it as a “quiver,” “flutter” or “flip-flop” of the heart in the chest.Drinking a similar number of added-sugar beverages raised the risk of the condition by 10%, while drinking about four ounces of pure, unsweetened juices, such as orange or vegetable juice, was associated with an 8% lower risk of atrial fibrillation, the study found.“This is the first study to report an association between no- and low-calorie sweeteners and also sugar-sweetened beverages and increased risk of atrial fibrillation,” said Penny Kris-Etherton, a professor emeritus of nutritional sciences at the Pennsylvania State University, in a statement. She was not involved in the new study.While the study could only show an association between sweetened drinks and A-fib, the relationship remained after accounting for any genetic susceptibility to the condition. A 2017 study found people with European ancestry had about a 22% risk of inheriting the condition.“We still need more research on these beverages to confirm these findings and to fully understand all the health consequences on heart disease and other health conditions,” said Kris-Etherton, who is also an American Heart Association nutrition committee member.“In the meantime, water is the best choice, and, based on this study, no- and low-calorie sweetened beverages should be limited or avoided,” she added.Atrial fibrillation is the leading cause of stroke in the United States. In addition, strokes connected to A-fib tend to be “more severe than strokes with other underlying causes,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Atrial fibrillation can also lead to blood clots, heart failure and “can increase the risk for heart attack, for dementia, for kidney disease. All of those things are likely long term risks,” Dr. Gregory Marcus, professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and associate chief of cardiology for research at UCSF Health, told CNN in a prior interview.Nearly 40 million people worldwide are living with atrial fibrillation, 6 million of those in the United States alone, according to the Heart Rhythm Society, who represents more than 7,000 specialists in cardiac rhythm disorders from more than 90 countries.Many of those people suffer chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath and fatigue. But for others, A-fib is symptomless, a potentially silent killer. Once detected, however, the condition can be treated with medications, lifestyle changes and if necessary, surgeries to slow or restore the heart’s normal rhythm.The rate of atrial fibrillation in the US population is growing: The CDC estimates some 12 million Americans will have A-fib by 2030.“Age is one of the most important risk factors, so with the aging of the population it’s becoming more common,” Marcus said.The epidemic of obesity is also contributing to the growing numbers, along with other risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, smoking and drinking alcohol.“Previous research has shown high soft drink consumption to be association with increased risk of AF (atrial fibrillation),” said Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, in a statement. He was not involved in the new study.“Risk of AF is well known to be associated with type 2 diabetes, binge drinking of alcohol (commonly called holiday heart) as well as illicit drug use (cocaine),” Sanders said.The study, published Tuesday in the journal Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology, analyzed data on nearly 202,000 people participating in a large, biomedical database called the UK Biobank. Followed for an average of 10 years, people in the analysis ranged in age from 37 to 73 years old, and more than half were female.Higher consumers of artificially sweetened beverages were more likely to be female, younger, weigh more and have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, the study found. Those who drank more sugar-sweetened beverages were more likely to be male, younger, weigh more and have a higher prevalence of heart disease.People who drank both sugar-sweetened beverages and pure juice were “more likely to have a higher intake of total sugar than those who drank artificially sweetened drinks,” according to the statement.“Our study’s findings cannot definitively conclude that one beverage poses more health risk than another due to the complexity of our diets and because some people may drink more than one type of beverage,” said lead study author Dr. Ningjian Wang, a professor at the Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in Shanghai, China.“However, based on these findings, we recommend that people reduce or even avoid artificially sweetened and sugar-sweetened beverages whenever possible,” Wang said in the statement. “Do not take it for granted that drinking low-sugar and low-calorie artificially sweetened beverages is healthy, it may pose potential health risks.”"

        "title": "CDC urges vaccination amid rise in measles cases in the US and globally",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "US health officials are warning doctors about the dramatic rise in measles cases around the world, and advising families traveling to a measles-affected country to get babies as young as 6 months vaccinated before they go.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert to doctors on Monday to increase awareness of the international spread of measles, and urged them to vaccinate infants a few months ahead of the typical schedule if families are planning to go abroad.The warning comes ahead of the busy spring and summer travel season. Many countries, including Austria, Philippines, Romania and the United Kingdom–destinations frequented by American tourists–are experiencing measles outbreaks, the CDC noted.The CDC also warned about lagging vaccination rates in 36 US states where fewer than 95% of kindergarteners have been vaccinated against measles, putting them below the herd immunity threshold. Herd immunity is the portion of the population that must be immunized against an infection to prevent its spread through the community.Even so, vaccination rates against measles in the U.S. are “pretty strong,” said Dr. Nirav Shah, CDC’s principal deputy director, so this isn’t a situation like Covid, where everyone is susceptible.“For vaccinated individuals … the likelihood of contracting measles is thankfully not what it was in days gone by because the vaccination rates are high,” Shah said. “That said, we are concerned that vaccination rates have fallen just a little bit from 95% to 93%.”Shah says two percentage points may not seem like a lot, but across the population, it represents about 250,000 kindergarteners who are unprotected.﻿The measles vaccines is considered one of the most protective. Two doses are about 97% effective at preventing infection, while a single dose is about 93% effective against infection.“The overwhelming scientific evidence shows that vaccines remain among the most effective and safest intervention to both prevent individual illness and protect the health of the public,” said Dr. Jesse Ehrenfeld, president of the American Medical Association, said in an emailed statement.In updated travel guidelines, the CDC is advising international travelers who are unsure about their vaccination status to see a doctor at least six weeks before their trip to make sure they have time to be fully immunized. Previous guidelines recommended seeing a doctor at least a month before the planned trip abroad.Normally, infants get their first measles, mumps and rubella shot at a year of age. The CDC says it is recommending the vaccination timeline be pushed up a few months to protect babies who have no immunity against the highly contagious infection.The CDC also recommends that unvaccinated children who are at least a year old get two doses of that measles containing vaccine at least 28 days apart before they travel.Measles virus can linger in the air for two hours after an infected person has passed through a room. People can also become infected if they touch a surface with virus particles, then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth. People can spread measles up to four days before and four days after they develop the characteristic rash.Approximately 9 out of 10 exposed individuals who don’t have immunity against the virus from previous infection or vaccination will catch it themselves.Travelers who get sick with a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes should seek medical attention, but the CDC advises giving the clinic some advance notice before you go, so they can take precautions to prevent potential measles spread.The CDC says that 46 countries currently have high numbers of measles cases, including 26 in Africa, four in Europe, eight in the Middle East, seven in Asia, and two in Southeast AsiaThe US has officially eliminated measles as an endemic infection, but the nation still sees imported cases every year. These cases are usually unvaccinated US residents who become infected during international travel.The US is on pace for a busy year. So far in 2024, the US has seen 58 measles cases in 17 jurisdictions, according to the CDC — the same number of cases seen in all of 2023 — and some were spread locally.Recent cases in the US have been reported in Chicago, California, Arizona, Florida and Pennsylvania.The CDC is warning all international travelers that they may be susceptible to measles if they have not been fully vaccinated at least two weeks prior to departure or have not had measles in the past.Measles can be severe in all age groups and can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia and death.Groups who are more likely to face severe complications include children younger than age 5, adults older than 20 years of age, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune function.Many countries have seen declines in childhood vaccinations. Over 61 million doses of vaccines that protect against measles were missed during the Covid-19 pandemic, increasing the risk of measles outbreaks, according to the CDC.That led to a steep rise in measles cases around the globe. For example, the WHO’s European region, which includes parts of Asia, had less than 1,000 measles cases in 2022 and more than 30,000 last year.WHO’s most recent data shows that measles cases jumped 18% around the globe last year to around 9 million. Measles deaths increased 43% to about 136,000."

        "title": "Eli Lilly warns of temporary short supply of two insulin products",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Drugmaker Eli Lilly warned this week that two of its formulations of insulin would be temporarily out of stock through the beginning of April, citing a “brief delay in manufacturing.”The 10-milliliter vials of Humalog and insulin lispro injection will be in short supply at wholesalers and some pharmacies, Lilly said in a statement posted online Wednesday. The company said that prefilled pen versions of those medicines are still available in the US and that it continues to manufacture the 10-milliliter vials “and will ship them as soon as we can.”More than 8 million people in the US rely on insulin to survive, according to the American Diabetes Association. Although other forms are available, it’s not always simple for patients to switch between different brands of insulin or delivery methods, said Laura Marston, an advocate for lower insulin prices who has type 1 diabetes and uses Humalog.Marston said she gets a reaction when she uses an alternative brand, and she relies on Humalog vials for her insulin pump. She said she may be able to use the prefilled pens for her pump, but her insurance covers only vials, via a complicated step known as prior authorization.“If Lilly doesn’t fix this fast, I actually don’t know what I’m going to do,” Marston told CNN.With the insurance issues, Marston noted, she may seek a new prescription and try out the company’s coupon program offering insulin for $35 for those without insurance — a complicated set of steps to access a medicine that people with diabetes rely on to live.Lilly said in its statement that the company recognizes “that any supply challenge may cause a disruption in people’s treatment regimens, and we are moving with urgency to address it.”People who have trouble getting their prescription filled should contact their health-care provider to discuss switching to the same insulin in a prefilled pen “or other insulin treatment options,” Lilly said. The company also suggested that patients check other pharmacies.Those who need insulin immediately “and cannot access their healthcare provider for an alternative treatment option should seek emergency care,” Lilly said.More than 6 million units of insulin lispro injection, the form facing the supply disruption, were sold in the past three months, said Evan Seigerman, a stock analyst with financial firm BMO Capital Markets, citing data from provider IQVIA. Slightly more than half of those were the vials in short supply, he said. Humalog is the brand name of insulin lispro injection.“This could be a bit of a problem,” Seigerman said. “Folks will need to use the pens.”Tarsis Lopez, a spokesman for Lilly, told CNN that the “dynamic nature of insulin supply and demand, coupled with a brief delay in manufacturing, led to the temporary supply constraint.”Dr. Jeff Jonas, a veteran drug industry executive whose son relies on insulin for type 1 diabetes, said he’d have thought insulin “demand and supply are pretty predictable, so when something like this happens, it really heightens the sense of insecurity amongst patients about the supply of their drug.”Jonas said he’d been worried about the prospect of shortages since Lilly and other makers of insulin announced major price cuts on the drugs last year.“My concern as a parent in this whole area is the notion that if you set a price that’s arbitrarily too low, you run the risk of disincentivizing manufacture and further investment,” Jonas said, noting that he has no specific knowledge of what’s driving the situation at Lilly.Drug shortages are an increasing problem in the US and oftentimes happen with older medicines whose prices have fallen because their patents have expired but are still complex to manufacture.Disruptions in access to insulin, Jonas said, “can be life-threatening for patients.” He noted that the feeling of insecurity could lead to stockpiling, which could exacerbate shortages further.Lilly and other manufacturers of insulin said last year that they would reduce the list price of the drugs by 70%, under pressure from patient advocates and politicians, and after a law affecting Medicaid rebates took effect that would have cost the companies money because of price hikes taken on insulin over the years.The companies have also put into place programs that enable patients to get insulin for $35 a month, with or without insurance; doing so for seniors on Medicare was a key part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. As many as 1 in 4 patients has reported having to ration insulin because of the cost.Insulin has been a shrinking part of Lilly’s business; Humalog brought in $1.7 billion in revenue for the company last year, down almost 20% from the year before. In contrast, the company’s newer drugs for type 2 diabetes and weight loss, Mounjaro and Zepbound, brought in more than $5 billion and are growing so quickly that the company is struggling to keep up with demand.Lopez said the insulin supply disruption is unrelated to those products, noting, “we take both diseases very seriously.”Seigerman said he didn’t think “pricing is overly driving the shortage, as it seems to be temporary. Lilly still seems to be doing its job in getting patients these life-saving medications.”Jonas, now a partner with Boston-based venture capital firm Cure Ventures, said he credited Lilly and other makers of insulin with continuing to ensure a safe, high-quality supply of a drug that’s complex to manufacture.But he said he and his son, now a young adult who’s used an insulin pump since he was a kid, are feeling anxious about this supply disruption.The companies are “supplying an important drug,” Jonas said. “The question is: How do we balance the need for affordability with the ability to maintain supply in a way that’s economically feasible for companies to do it?”"

        "title": "Global fertility rates to plunge in decades ahead, new report says",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "A new study projects that global fertility rates, which have been declining in all countries since 1950, will continue to plummet through the end of the century, resulting in a profound demographic shift.The fertility rate is the average number of children born to a woman in her lifetime. Globally, that number has gone from 4.84 in 1950 to 2.23 in 2021 and will continue to drop to 1.59 by 2100, according to the new analysis, which was based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, a research effort led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. The study was published Wednesday in the journal the Lancet.“What we are experiencing now, and have been experiencing for decades, is something that we have not seen before in human history, which is a large-scale, cross-national, cross-cultural shift towards preferring and having smaller families,” said Dr. Jennifer D. Sciubba, a demographer and author of “8 Billion and Counting: How Sex, Death, and Migration Shape Our World,” who was not involved with the new research.Dr. Christopher Murray, senior author of the study and director of IHME, said there are many reasons for this shift, including increased opportunities for women in education and employment and better access to contraception and reproductive health services.Dr. Gitau Mburu, a scientist in the World Health Organization’s Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research who wrote a comment that was published alongside the study, said in an email to CNN that economic factors such as the direct cost of raising children, the perceived risk of death to children and changing values on gender equality and self-fulfillment are all forces that may contribute to declining fertility rates. The relative contribution of these factors varies over time and by country, he added.To maintain stable population numbers, countries need a total fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman, a number called the replacement level. When the fertility rate falls below the replacement level, populations begin to shrink.The new analysis estimates that 46% of countries had a fertility rate below replacement level in 2021. That number will increase to 97% by 2100, meaning the population of almost all countries in the world will be declining by the end of the century.A previous analysis by IHME published in the Lancet in 2020 predicted that the world population will peak in 2064 at around 9.7 billion and then decline to 8.8 billion by 2100. Another projection by the UN World Population Prospects 2022 predicted world population to peak at 10.4 billion in the 2080s.Regardless of the exact timing of peak world population, it will likely begin declining in the second half of the century, Sciubba said, with dramatic geopolitical, economic and societal consequences.Although fertility rates are declining in all countries, the rate of decline is uneven, creating a shift in the distribution of live births around the globe, according to the analysis.The study predicts that the share of the world’s live births in low-income regions will nearly double from 18% in 2021 to 35% in 2100. Sub-Saharan Africa alone will account for 1 in every 2 children born on the planet by 2100.This shift in the distribution of live births will create a “demographically divided world” where high-income countries face the consequences of an aging population and declining workforce while low-income regions maintain a high birth rate that strains existing resources, according to the analysis.“An important contribution of the study is to highlight the demographic contrast between the richest countries (with very low fertility) and the poorest countries (with still high fertility),” Dr. Teresa Castro Martín, a professor at the Institute of Economics, Geography and Demography of the Spanish National Research Council, who was not involved with the new research, said in a statement from the Science Media Centre. “Globally, births will be increasingly concentrated in the areas of the world most vulnerable to climate change, resource scarcity, political instability, poverty and infant mortality.”On one end of the spectrum, high-income countries with plummeting fertility rates will experience a shift toward an aging population that will strain national health insurance, social security programs and health care infrastructure. They will also have to contend with labor shortages, according to the study.The researchers suggest that ethical and effective policies that encourage immigration and labor innovations, like advancements in artificial intelligence, could help reduce some of the economic effects of this demographic shift.The analysis also looked at the efficacy of pro-natal policies that some countries have implemented, such as child care subsidies, extended parental leave and tax incentives. The projections show an effect size of no more than 0.2 additional live births per female if pro-natal policies are implemented, which does not suggest a strong, sustained rebound, according to the study.Although policies supporting parents may be beneficial to society for other reasons, they do not seem to change the trajectory of the current demographic shift, Murray said.The researchers emphasize that low fertility rates and the modest effects of pro-natal policies should not be used to justify measures that coerce women into having more children, such as limiting reproductive rights and restricting access to contraceptives.“There is a real threat in some governments trying to pressure women to have more children,” Murray said. “It’s very easy to go from encouraging women to have more children to being a little bit more coercive.”A shrinking population poses great economic and societal challenges, but it also has environmental benefits, Mburu said.A smaller global population could alleviate strain on global resources and reduce carbon emissions. However, increasing consumption per capita due to economic development could offset these gains, the study says.On the other end of the spectrum, more live births in low-income countries will threaten the security of food, water and other resources and will make improving child mortality even more difficult. Political instability and security issues also may arise in these vulnerable areas, the analysis predicts.The predictions show that improving access to modern contraceptives and female education – two primary drivers of fertility – would reduce fertility rates and limit the increase of live births in low-income areas.In sub-Saharan Africa, universal female education or universal contraceptive access by 2030 would result in a total fertility rate of about 2.3 in 2050, compared with 2.7 in the reference scenario, according to the study.Additionally, these changes would contribute to women’s empowerment, which has important societal benefits, the study says.“The main strain comes from our inability to adjust,” Sciubba said. “How do we adjust to what we have? I think that is where we really lack innovation and political will.”Sciubba said she thinks about three alternative approaches that society can take to adapt to a shrinking, aging global population.One scenario is the status quo world, where we go about our business as usual, maintain economic policies that rely on continued population growth and perhaps implement a few pro-natal policies that don’t make much of a difference, she said. This will not solve any of the economic and societal problems that this study outlines.The second scenario is a fearful world in which fear-mongering and alarmism take over and women are coerced into having more children.And the final scenario is a resilient world, where we realize that we are not going to shift the number of children people have but instead learn to adapt our systems to the new reality, she added.Studies like this one that model and predict global demographic changes are important, Sciubba said, because they can inform proactive planning for a resilient future. However, projections should always be interpreted with caution, she said. It is most helpful to look at the overall trends instead of the specific details.“The most useful thing is to zoom out and say, ‘there’s no doubt there has been a shift,’ ” she said. “ ‘It’s changing, so what do we do?’ “"

        "title": "Ditch your air fryer and replace it with this magic multitasker",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "My love affair with small appliances started at an early age.The Easy-Bake Oven was my first glimpse of what magic could come from a miniature box, leading to a few experiments with microwave cooking — think nachos and Rice Krispie Treat bowls—during my latchkey kid years. And the minute I got my own off-campus apartment in college, I invested in my very own toaster oven.Twenty-something years later, toaster oven technology has moved far beyond the analog dial and hot coils of my first model. But my small oven love remains strong, and it’s the most-used appliance in my daily life.The word “oven” is crucial in its name because it does everything my full-size conventional oven can do and more. In fact, it’s not just a toaster oven; it’s a countertop oven.If I had to choose to keep only one of my kitchen toys — the high-speed blender, the stand mixer, the compressor ice-cream maker, the multicooker — the countertop oven would likely come out on top. (OK, I admit it would be difficult to give up the stand mixer.) That’s how deep my commitment to my countertop oven reaches. Here’s why.Instead of having multiple appliances crowding my countertop, the countertop oven does the work of many. It toasts bread and bagels, sure, but it also has the capability to do convection baking, air frying, dehydrating and dough proofing.Its broiler is spacious enough and functions so much more effectively than my oven’s broiler that I don’t even risk throwing out my back to shove sheet pans into the drawer underneath the full-size oven. (Who designed these bottom broiler drawers, anyway?)My countertop oven is also my secret weapon in the fight for better leftovers. When I create a monthly meal plan, I’m always planning to reheat half of what I’m cooking, so this is a crucial function. And because most dishes taste better when they’re not zapped in a microwave, I let my countertop oven restore my meals to their original crispy, bubbly texture. No more soggy cutlets or mushy pasta casseroles in this house!Yes, I understand that a countertop oven will never heat food as quickly as the one-minute express cook button on a microwave can. But I’ll argue that the taste trade-offs are worth it, and that you’ll still be heating food and cooking more quickly than you would in a large conventional oven.My countertop oven preheats to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius) in five minutes (I’ve timed it), whereas my full-size oven takes 15 minutes to reach the same temperature. That’s a big difference — I can be done eating my leftover-but-perfectly-heated pizza in those 10 minutes!Moreover, the convection and air-fry functions on my countertop oven cook food more quickly and efficiently than conventional heat, since the convection method circulates hot air around the food for a more even heat distribution. I can shave at least five minutes off my baking and roasting times every time I make meals in my countertop oven.When the decades-old range in our kitchen finally went to the big scrap pile in the sky a few years ago, I refused to replace it with a high-end model. My top-of-the-line countertop oven cost half as much as the range we purchased, and I use it twice as often.I’ll never forget the process of testing my first cookbook, “Classic Snacks Made from Scratch,” during a sweltering New Jersey summer. It was July, and I was working on various recipes for homemade crackers, which meant keeping my oven on for hours — in a house without central air-conditioning.In between batches, I laid on my kitchen floor, sweating and crying, wondering why I was voluntarily putting myself through such torture.I still don’t have central air, but thankfully, I’m not regularly tasked with developing and testing multiple baked goods every day of the week. For everyday summer baking and roasting, however, I’ll use my countertop oven, which gives off much less heat than my full-size oven and cools down much more quickly once its cooking cycle is finished.If I want to bake some goodies that require my larger baking sheets or multiple sheet pans, I’ll simply bake on my grill.So, I’ve convinced you to ditch all your other appliances and replace them with a countertop oven. Great! But before you rush out to buy one, think about what oven best suits your cooking habits.Choose a model that can fit your everyday cookware and bakeware. My countertop oven is deep and wide enough to fit a standard 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-centimeter) casserole dish or sheet pan or a 10-inch (25-centimeter) round baking pan or cast-iron skillet. This means I can cook meals for up to six or eight people in one little appliance.Size does matter. Yes, choosing a smaller oven can be tempting when it comes to keeping your kitchen looking open and tidy. For the most versatility, however, I’d recommend going with the largest model that can comfortably fit the space you’re planning to use it in. Your foods need the air circulating around them in the oven to cook most efficiently, so having a space that’s too small to allow that won’t be doing you any favors.Consider what extra functions you’ll need. As I noted earlier, my countertop oven comes with a lot of bells and whistles — including a few functions I don’t even bother using. I’ve never tried the slow cook function, for instance, even though it’s there. Some models come with wi-fi functionality so you can control them via an app. Decide if these things are worth the money to you.Casey Barber is a food writer, artist and editor of the website Good Food Stories."

        "text": "Doctors have performed the first transplant of a genetically modified kidney from a pig into a living human, they announced Thursday.The four-hour surgery was performed Saturday at Massachusetts General Hospital, which was also the first hospital to perform a kidney transplant in 1954.The patient, Rick Slayman, a 62-year-old manager with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation who had been diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease, is recovering well and expected to be discharged from the hospital soon.Doctors said Thursday that they thought his new kidney could last years but also acknowledged that there are many unknowns in animal-to-human transplants.In a written statement provided by the hospital, Slayman said he had been a patient in the hospital’s transplant program for 11 years. He previously received a kidney from a human donor in 2018 after living with diabetes and high blood pressure for many years. That kidney began to show signs of failure five years later, and he resumed dialysis in 2023.When he was diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease last year, he said, his doctors suggested that he try a pig kidney.“I saw it not only as a way to help me, but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive,” Slayman said in the statement.Doctors who were not involved in the case said the surgery represented a significant medical milestone.“To finally see this come to fruition after years of work and collaboration is really a huge step forward and a great moment for transplant,” said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, chief of surgical transplantation at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, director of the Legorreta Center for Clinical Transplant Tolerance and the surgeon who performed the operation, said the pig organ was exactly the same size as a human kidney.When they stitched it in, connecting its blood vessels to Slayman’s, Kawai said, it immediately “pinked up” and began to make urine. The 15-member transplant team in the operating room burst into applause, he said.“It was truly the most beautiful kidney I have ever seen,” Kawai said Thursday in a news briefing that was emotional for the doctors involved, some of whom have worked on this research for their entire careers.One doctor choked up as he thanked the patient, his colleagues and their biotech partners. A fellow physician put a hand on his shoulder and said, “You did it.”The need for organs far outstrips the number that are available. Every day, 17 people in the US die waiting for an organ, and kidneys are the organ in shortest supply. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, roughly 27,000 kidneys were transplanted in 2023, but nearly 89,000 people were on the waitlist for those organs.Experts say xenotransplants – transplants of animal organs into people – are crucial to solving the organ shortage.“It also could be a potential breakthrough in solving one of the more intractable problems in our field, that being an unequal access for ethnic minority patients to the opportunity for kidney transplantation,” said Dr. Winfred Williams, associate chief of the Department of Nephrology at Mass General, in the news briefing.This is the third transplant of a pig organ into a living human. The first two were hearts transplanted into living people who had run out of other transplant options. The organs were transplanted under special rules that permit compassionate use of experimental therapies for people in especially dire situations. Both patients died weeks after receiving their organs.The researchers at Mass General Brigham said that although the latest advance was important, more research is needed – ideally a large study conducted at many hospitals – to better understand how effective pig kidney transplants may be.“Our hope is that dialysis will become obsolete,” said Dr. Leonardo Riella, medical director of kidney transplantation at Mass General. “Dialysis will be like a ventilator for a patient with respiratory failure. You use it for a period of time, and hopefully if they’re healthy enough, they could have a more permanent solution, which could be a human transplant or a xenotransplant.”Williams said Slayman had been his patient for more than a decade before the procedure.He said the xenotransplant made a lot of sense for Slayman, who had “great difficulty” on dialysis. Vascular disease, diabetes and high blood pressure meant the blood vessels that that fed the dialysis machine would frequently clot, complicating treatment.Slayman needed more and more interventions to remove the clots. He estimates that he endured 30 to 40 procedures to address the problems.“At one point, he told me he thought he would not be able to go on. He literally said, ‘I don’t think I can go on like this. I don’t want to go on like this,’ ” Williams said.At that point, Williams said, he began to explore extraordinary options and landed on the idea of using pig organs for Slayman.The organ came from a pig that was genetically modified by a company eGenesis Bio to make it more compatible with a human. Other companies are also working to make pig tissues and organs suitable for xenotransplants.Experiments taking blood and skin from animals and using them in humans began in the 1600s with blood and skin.Researchers say the goal of transplanting pig kidneys to humans began to be pursued in the 1960s.Although pig kidneys are remarkably similar to human kidneys, figuring how to prevent the human immune system from rejecting them has not been easy, they noted.“The human immune system reacts incredibly violently to a pig organ, much moreso than to a human organ,” said Dr. Joren Madsen, director of the Mass General Transplant Center.Madsen noted that if you gave a person the same medicines used to prevent the rejection of other human organs and tried it with pig kidneys, “that transplant would reject and turn black in minutes. Minutes.”There are three key advances that have finally made xenotransplantation a reality, Madsen said.First, eGenesis was able to use CRISPR-Cas9 technology to make 69 precise edits to the pig’s DNA – in some areas, snipping things out, in other spots putting things in – to prevent the human body from recognizing the pig kidneys as foreign and rejecting them. They knocked out three genes that for sugars that are expressed on the surface of pig cells that can be recognized by human antibodies and and attacked. They also used gene editing to deactivate pig retroviruses that can reawaken and infect humans.The second: Pharmaceutical companies were able to make special monoclonal antibodies specifically tailored to prevent the rejection of pig organs.Finally, Madsen said, they were able to test pig organs in non-human animal models to develop the best protocols to translate the technology to people.“This successful procedure heralds a new era in medicine in which we have the potential to eliminate organ supply as a barrier to transplantation and realize our vision that no patient dies waiting for an organ,” Dr. Michael Curtis, CEO of eGenesis, said in news release.“We are humbled by the courage and generosity of this patient, who is a true pioneer, enabling this major break-through in science and transplant medicine,” he said."

        "title": "After four years with Covid-19, the US is settling into a new approach to respiratory virus season",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "With the arrival of spring, the United States is easing out of respiratory virus season, a familiar pattern that has been challenged by Covid-19 for the past four years.The addition of a novel germ has complicated and expanded respiratory virus season, which was already notoriously difficult to predict. This season had its own unique set of circumstances as public health balanced a significant transition out of the public health emergency with efforts to find a sustainable way forward.Experts say that focused planning and forecasting efforts helped avoid some of the worst-case scenarios. But there was still a significant number of severe outcomes, and there are still key areas of improvement – especially around vaccination.“I am grateful that we’re not still in the height of the pandemic, but we saw some really strong, severe respiratory disease season increases, and some groups were incredibly impacted by it,” said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.There have been at least 29 million illnesses, 320,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths from flu this season, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. And the burden from Covid-19 has been about twice as large.At least 42,000 people have died from Covid-19 since the beginning of September, according to provisional data from the CDC, reaching a peak of more than 2,500 deaths during the week ending January 13. Covid-19 hospitalizations also peaked in early January, with more than 35,000 new admissions during the week ending January 6 and more than 570,000 total hospitalizations since September.With flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and “with the addition of a third virus (COVID-19) that can cause severe disease, even an average respiratory season can place significant strain on our healthcare system,” the CDC’s Center for Forecasting Analytics wrote when it released its first outlook for the season in September. It predicted that this respiratory disease season would be similar to the year before — which saw hospitals more full than at any other point in the pandemic — and worse than pre-pandemic years once again.In developing the seasonal outlook, the Center for Forecasting Analytics identified a number of key variables could have shifted the season’s outlook for the worse, including a new coronavirus variant, a more severe flu season or overlapping peaks for multiple viruses.The forecasts have held relatively steady throughout the season, in large part because the viruses spared us from these more severe scenarios. But the US still lagged on one key factor that was fully within human control: vaccination rates.Only about 23% of US adults and 14% of children have gotten the latest Covid-19 vaccine, according to data from the CDC. And just about half of the population got their flu shot this year, a tick down from recent years.“The Covid vaccine is a really safe and effective vaccine that’s kind of a miraculous scientific advancement. It’s discouraging to me that so many people seem to be ambivalent or unwilling to get it, and we really need to work on that,” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “This should be a real asset for our society, and people should be taking better advantage of it.”A complicated set of reasons may have contributed to low vaccination rates this year, experts say – especially for the Covid-19 and RSV vaccines.The timing for the Covid-19 vaccine was a bit off this season, Plescia said. The latest shot was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in mid-September, when Covid-19 hospitalizations had already been on the rise for months.“One of the problems with the Covid vaccine is that it came out kind of late in the process,” he said. “If we had the vaccine approved and available earlier — maybe in the summer — that gives people a little bit longer to become familiar with and take advantage of the recommendations. That might make a difference.”Shifting perceptions on where people can get vaccinated — and emphasizing the important role that physicians can play in promoting vaccination at doctor’s visits, in particular — could also really lift vaccination rates, Plescia said.“It’s great that pharmacies are such an easy and efficient and convenient way for people to get vaccinated, but that only works for people who specifically want and seek the vaccine,” he said. “Early in the pandemic, everybody wanted to get vaccinated, so we really leaned heavily on pharmacies. But I think that’s where we’ve lost some ground.”But there were challenges in accessing vaccines this season, especially at pediatrician offices. People also had trouble finding vaccines at pharmacies early on, running into roadblocks that didn’t exist before the government commercialized the Covid-19 vaccines last year.“I think we need to shift back to really work with the medical care community on addressing whatever the issues are that may be making it difficult for them to stock the vaccines,” Plescia said. “We need to really make sure that when people are going to see their doctors, particularly people who are vulnerable, that they’re getting these recommendations, they’re having the chance to talk through it with their clinician and work through any concerns or issues.”The sense of urgency around vaccination also faded as attention on respiratory viruses waned, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communication and director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center. Her work has focused on health and science communication, including research on vaccine confidence.“When people become attentive, they become pretty good at seeking out knowledge, and they’re pretty effective at aligning their behaviors with that knowledge,” she said. “The problem is that most of the time, we’re inattentive to most of these things, and as a result, it takes a lot more effort to get the attention that is required to get the messaging in place and the messaging tied to a behavior.”Habits have built up around flu vaccination for much of the population in a way that hasn’t developed for Covid-19 vaccines, she said, which is probably why Covid-19 vaccination rates fell so much further.“Flu vaccination is a habitual behavior. We don’t have that same kind of habitual behavior associated with the Covid vaccine. And when you stop hearing on a regular basis that Covid is a severe problem, it fades to the background in a way that flu does not,” Jamieson said.“It’s not vaccination hesitancy that you’re measuring. It’s whether or not you incentivize people or prime people by making the risk of the virus season salient enough for them decide if they need a vaccine.”For vaccines and otherwise, focused and effective communication is at the heart of a successful public health response, experts say, especially in a time as unique as this.“In all the chatter that was going on about the season, we really focused on what mattered the most and what would change the risk profile the most,” said Dylan George, director of the CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics.Ongoing and “vigilant” tracking of these factors helped the forecasts stay “spot-on in terms of helping people know what level of hospitalizations to expect from the big three: Covid, RSV and influenza,” George said.They “gave more specificity to what it meant to be ready,” which served as a helpful communication tool with state epidemiologists, state health officials and health care systems, he said.Although flu is known to be seasonal, there’s a lot of variation in the timing and severity each year. And Covid-19 is still revealing its patterns, too.The CDC launched the Center for Forecasting Analytics about two years ago, and the group’s respiratory virus season outlooks mark a “subtle but powerful shift” in the ways public health can think about the respiratory virus season, George said.“For infectious diseases that are changing very quickly, we need to be more prospective,” he said. The outlook “was a good addition to help the institution of public health and CDC start looking more forward in how we’re trying to anticipate risks as they are coming at us instead of just getting hit with something and then trying to understand what we’re hit with.”Despite elevated levels of disease, hospitals generally avoided large-scale spikes in admissions from respiratory viruses this season.Even before the pandemic, hospitals would plan for respiratory virus season and the variability that comes with it, and Covid-19 added a few more factors to that equation, said Akin Demehin, senior director of quality and safety policy with the American Hospital Association.“There’s an ongoing process of assessment, reassessment, planning, flexing up or down depending on what the needs are on the ground,” he said. “Going into this season, I think hospitals and health systems knew there would be some unknowns around the amount of strain that Covid-19 was going to put on the health care system, and certainly rates of vaccination are one of those contributing factors to that uncertainty.”Still, better vaccination rates could have eased some of that unpredictability and helped keep hospital capacity levels even more stable this season, experts say.“I think what the Covid-19 pandemic really underscored for everybody in the health care system is just how much the situation on the ground can change and how rapidly it can change,” Demehin said. “We know that [vaccines] are incredibly effective tools in keeping people healthy, keeping them out of the hospital and, ultimately, on taking some pressure off of the health care delivery system when we do experience these annual spikes in respiratory viruses.”Data collection ramped up significantly during the Covid-19 pandemic, much of which has scaled back since the public health emergency ended about a year ago, in May 2023. The federal government still requires hospitals to report various data points related to Covid-19, but that will end next month.Experts emphasize that this is just the fourth data point we have to understand the new trajectory of respiratory virus seasons in the US.“We are one step closer to understanding more about what respiratory season is going to be looking like, generally, but we’re not there yet,” Hamilton said."

        "title": "‘It’s like staring at demons’: Meet a man who lives with a disturbing condition",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "For 59-year-old Victor Sharrah, the terrifying symptoms began on a winter day in Nashville.“I just woke up and was sitting on the couch watching TV when my roommate came into the room, and (looking at him) I’m like, ‘What am I seeing?’ Then his girlfriend walked in and her face was the same,” Sharrah told CNN.Each of the once-familiar faces had a grotesque grimace, elongated eyes and deeply etched scars. When turned to the side, pointy ears suddenly appeared, he said, much like those of Spock, the Vulcan first officer on the USS Enterprise in Star Trek.“I tried to explain to my roommate what I was seeing, and he thought I was nuts. Then I went outside and all of the faces of people I saw were distorted and still are,” Sharrah said.“It’s like staring at demons,” he added. “Imagine waking up one morning and suddenly everybody in the world looks like a creature in a horror movie.”Sharrah has a rare condition called prosopometamorphopsia, or PMO, in which parts of the faces of other people appear distorted in shape, texture, position or color. Objects and other parts of a person’s body, however, typically remain undisturbed.“I helped create a computer-generated 2D picture of what I see in faces, but there’s so much more to it,” said Sharrah, speaking about research on his case that was published in the “Clinical Pictures” section of The Lancet Thursday.“What people don’t understand from a picture is that the distorted face is moving, contorting, talking to you, making facial gestures,” he added. “It does kind of distance me from other people a bit. I try not to let it because I know what it is, it’s PMO. Yet I still feel like I’m not getting as close to people as I used to.”Prosopometamorphopsia is different from “face blindness,” the condition shared by actor Brad Pitt, former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, renowned neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks, Sweden’s Crown Princess Victoria and perhaps as many as 1 in 50 people. In face blindness, faces are not distorted; instead the brain simply has trouble recognizing faces, even familiar faces — making nearly everyone a stranger.With PMO, however, a person will often have little trouble recognizing a loved one or familiar face, yet that face will be distorted, often in predictable ways.“For me the basic distortions are the same for each person, with the lines in the face, the stretching of the eyes and the mouth, and the pointy ears,” Sharrah said. “But the size and shape of a person’s face or head and how they move can be different and change just how distorted they might be.”Some people with PMO see their own faces as distorted or even damaged. Two patients, “while standing in front of the mirror, saw one eye popping out of its socket and slithering down the cheek,” according to an April 2023 review of literature.For others with the condition, like Victor, the entire face of another person appears misshapen, much like a “funhouse mirror,” according to a description in another published case study. Others see only half the face as crooked or malformed.After a tumor was removed from the left side of his brain, one patient described the right side of his doctor’s face in which the “eye became a ghastly staring hole, cheek bone a cavity; he had teeth on the upper lip, often had two ears.” Others with PMO have eloquently described faces as “like clocks in a Dalí painting” or “kaleidoscopically changing.”Still others have seen faces morph into dragons or fish heads, or ears pop out of the top of people’s heads. Some patients report seeing shortened arms attached to faces, people’s eyes leaving the skull and rotating in front of it, or third eyes in the middle of people’s foreheads.“The woman who saw dragons began seeing them as a child, so there are development cases of PMO in which people grow up with the condition and don’t know that faces are supposed to look different,” said Brad Duchaine, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.Only 81 cases of PMO exist in published literature, according to a June 2021 review, but there are likely many more people living with the condition, said Duchaine, the senior author on the Lancet case study.“We started a website so people can learn about PMO, and we’ve heard from at least 80 people so far,” he said. “And we’re finding that people from around the world are reporting the same symptoms without knowing anything about others with the condition.”With so little knowledge available, many people with PMO can be diagnosed with schizophrenia or other similar hallucinatory conditions and put on anti-psychotic medications or even institutionalized, said Antônio Vitor Reis Goncalves Mello, a doctoral student in psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth, who is first author on the case study.However, science now knows that people can develop PMO after a brain injury, tumor or infection, or after seizures such as in epilepsy, he said.“A piece of good evidence is that in more than 50% of cases with half-face distortions, for example, the patient has a lesion to a particular part of the brain,” Mello said. “In those cases we’re confident they’re not making it up, so when other people come along and report very similar experiences it seems unlikely that they are not being truthful.”Diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a teen, Sharrah struggled with mental illness that intensified into post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after a stint in the US Marine Corps.“I was in Beirut on October 23, 1983 when they bombed our barracks. And anytime something goes wrong in my life, my biggest battle is with suicidal psychosis — it’s the first place my brain turns,” he said.As part of his coping, Sharrah has been a long-time member of a Facebook suicide support group. Increasingly fearful of what was happening to him after the distortions began, he posted his symptoms online.“I feel like I’m shutting down. Like I’m dying inside. Every face I see that’s not on a screen looks evil, twisted and demented. I mean literally looks like something from a John Carpenter movie,” he wrote in January 2020.“I’m growing cold, hateful and uncaring. I don’t know how to stop it. Maybe it’s too late.”In Casper, Wyoming, Catherine Morris was waiting for a meeting to start and just happened to check Facebook, where she was a volunteer for the same suicide support group. Having worked in schools with the visually impaired for over 30 years, she was familiar with how people sometimes saw visual distortions based on how their brains perceived different colors and intensities of light.“I saw his post pop up, and I thought what do I do? I can reach out and maybe I can help him, but I don’t want to give him false hope,” Morris said. “I told him that he had to promise me one thing — while we were working together, he couldn’t hurt himself.”Morris knew from her training that such distortions could be triggered by a specific area of the brain called the fusiform gyrus, which is responsible for face perception, object recognition and reading. Light distorts, so the solution, she thought, might be finding a particular color or intensity of light that might reduce his symptoms.“I’ve bought one of the multi-colored light bulbs with an app that Catherine was able to control from Wyoming,” Sharrah said. “Then we got on a video call and did a whole bunch of our own tests.”Afraid for his mental health, Morris had asked Sharrah for his phone number and address before the tests because if “he became too upset, I was calling 911.”Then she had him look into a mirror while she manipulated the colors of light.“When I got to the wrong color of light, the red light that intensified the distortions, I watched it happen. He started to have a full on panic attack. He withdrew from the screen and the expression on his face was quite horrified,” Morris said.“I told him to shut his eyes and remember that this wasn’t real, his brain was tricking him,” she said. “Then I moved the light to green and asked him to open his eyes. He did and the distortion was gone. And he just sat there and bawled like a baby.”Boyed by their success, Morris ordered a pair of glasses tinted with the proper shade of green. Knowing that Sharrah was soon due to see his estranged daughter and meet his grandchildren for the first time, she sent them rush delivery.“And they arrived the morning he met his granddaughters,” she said. “He got to meet them for the first time, and they looked normal.”Today, Sharrah is working closely with Duchaine and Mello at their Dartmouth lab, helping test various interventions to ease or reverse the symptoms of PMO.The research has duplicated the benefits of green lenses in countering Sharrah’s symptoms and found that manipulating colors in lenses helped others with PMO as well — although the colors that work might differ. Another promising treatment – showing people with PMO completely symmetrical faces, which appears to reduce distortion.“If that stands up to more testing, perhaps glasses can be made to help people see faces more symmetrically,” Mello said.But one of the biggest breakthroughs came when the team realized that Sharrah did not see distortions on 2D images.“Most of the participants with PMO will see distortions to faces in real life and faces on images, which has kept us from being able to capture exactly what they see,” Morro said. “With Victor, we were able to have him describe a real person’s face while (also) looking at an image of them that we manipulated” until it reflected the distortions he saw.The research is “wonderful work,” and the first time that an accurate illustration of PMO has been captured, said psychiatrist Dr. Jan Dirk Blom, who heads the Outpatient Clinic for Uncommon Psychiatric Syndromes at Parnassia Psychiatric Institute in The Hague, Netherlands.For Sharrah, the research is a way that he might help save another person from being misdiagnosed by doctors unaware of the rare syndrome.“I almost had myself committed to a mental hospital, and one of the people who reached out to Dartmouth was institutionalized for psychosis. How many other people are institutionalized and being put on anti-psychotics when they’re not psychotic?”"

        "title": "How to talk to kids about a cancer diagnosis, according to experts",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "In the time Catherine, Princess of Wales, spent away from the public before revealing her cancer diagnosis, one of her biggest priorities was finding the right way to tell her children, she said.“Most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that’s appropriate to them and to reassure them that I’m going to be OK, she said in a video statement released Friday.After weeks of speculation about why the princess hadn’t been seen in public since having abdominal surgery in January, Kate released the video explaining that she was recovering to prepare for preventative chemotherapy treatment.Talking to children about the cancer diagnosis of their parent or loved one is important, and while families may have an instinct to protect their child from the scary feelings that come with it – clear communication is helpful for kids, said Dr. Claudia Gold, a pediatrician and early relational health specialist in Massachusetts.Exactly how to have conversations around cancer will vary depending on the individual child and family, but there are guidelines that can help direct adults, said Hadley Maya, a clinical social worker at Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers.“This is one of the most difficult conversations that parents and adults ever have to have with the children in their lives,” said Maya, who is also one of the coordinators for Talking with Children about Cancer, which provides support and guidance to parents and families facing a cancer diagnosis.Take the child’s age into account when talking to a young person about a parent’s cancer diagnosis, expert say.Preschool and younger: Children three and under will be most concerned about separation, abandonment and change in their daily lives, according to the American Cancer Society.“If there is a change to their routine, babies and toddlers might get easily confused, become more clingy, and might have changes to their usual sleeping, eating, or other daily habits,” the society states on its website.Suggestions include frequent cuddles and hugs, having a person the child is close to nearby to keep their routine as normal as possible, and using allowing the child to see a parent in the hospital in real time via video, phone or other technological means.Kindergarten and early elementary: For children between the ages of 4 and 6 — Prince Louis is 5 — being sick is often equated to having a cold or other contagious disease. Therefore, the child may worry they can “catch cancer,” the society said. Children this age may also feel as if the sadness and distress the family is feeling may be in some way their fault.Routine is still very important, as is having a familiar, reliable caregiver. Always use clear and simple language when communicating with children in this age range. Consider using playtime and art to help them understand the concept of cancer. Follow up by encouraging the child to role play with toys which may undercover misconceptions or misunderstandings.Elementary age children: Children between the ages of 7 and 12 — Princess Charlotte is 8, and Prince George is 10 — are more likely to understand the concept of cancer and be able to anticipate the future, the society said. However, they may also hide their feelings in order not to further upset loved ones.“For older children, more detail about the cancer can be given, as appropriate. Try not to overwhelm them with information, but be open and honest in answering any questions they might have,” the website said.“Listen for unasked questions, especially about the child’s own health and well-being. It’s OK for the child to see the parent cry or be angry if the child understands that they’re not to blame for these feelings. Try to help them understand that it’s normal to have strong feelings and it’s good to express them.”Keep the child in school and in after school activities, if possible, and inform any teachers, coaches or school staff about the illness, the society recommended. Tell the news to the families of their friends and assure the child that having fun is OK.Teenagers: Because they are old enough to understand the significance of a cancer diagnosis and the possibilities for the future, teens may worry more and need to be reassured that nothing they did or said caused the disease. Like younger children, they may also try to hide their sadness, anger or fear so as not to cause others further pain. Routine is still helpful, as are honest and open updates about the parent’s illness.“Give detailed information about the parent’s condition, symptoms, possible side effects of treatment, what they might expect, and other information, if they’re interested,” the agency said. “Keep open lines of communication and let them know they can talk to you at any time and ask any questions.”At this age, friends and social influences are key, so a teen may turn to the internet or lean on friends for help. Ask a friend or relative to pay special attention to each teenager in the family and assure the child that it’s OK to have fun and not feel guilty about it.“Teenagers experiencing distress might act out, withdraw from friends and family, and feel overwhelmed. Reassure them that it is OK to have these feelings and encourage them to learn how to respond and cope in healthy ways,” the society suggested.One of the most difficult and perhaps most pressing questions from a child when they learn their loved one has cancer is “are you going to be OK?”Even as the adult, you may not know the answer to that question.“You can always say, you know, I’m not ready to answer that question right now, or I don’t know right now, but I promise I’ll come I’ll get back to you,” Maya said.The most important things to give your child in that answer is reassurance that they are loved and protected no matter what, she said, modeling that it is OK to be unsure and sit in the difficult feelings.“That’s the most important thing, acknowledging it’s really hard to sit with uncertainty. That’s such a such a scary feeling,” Maya said.Parents often come to Maya looking for a script of the right thing to say, but the truth is that there isn’t one perfect way to talk about it, she said.In fact, it is often better when you don’t know exactly what to say and instead listen and respond to how your specific child reacts, Gold added.And don’t worry about having all the answers or addressing every feeling in the first conversation, because it is just that – the first of many conversations, Maya said.Some families like to set up regular check ins all together after doctor appointments to give updates. Others like to set up one on one time to talk about concerns or questions. And some children like to be involved – sending written questions for the doctors or seeing pictures of their toy at the treatment center or with the doctor, she added.The important thing is to take cues from your child and keep an open-door policy so that they know they can still come to you for support and love, Maya said."

        "title": "Nearly half of the tap water in the US is contaminated with ‘forever chemicals,’ government study finds",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Almost half of the tap water in the United States is contaminated with chemicals known as “forever chemicals,” according to a study from the US Geological Survey.The number of people drinking contaminated water may be even higher than what the study found, however, because the researchers weren’t able to test for all of these per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, or PFAS, chemicals that are considered dangerous to human health. There are more than 12,000 types of PFAS, according to the National Institutes of Health, but this study looked at only 32 of the compounds.PFAS are a family of ubiquitous synthetic chemicals that linger in the environment and the human body. PFAS exposure is linked to problems such as cancer, obesity, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, decreased fertility, liver damage and hormone suppression, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.In June 2022, based on the latest science, the EPA issued health advisories that said the chemicals are much more hazardous to human health than scientists originally thought and are probably more dangerous even at levels thousands of times lower than previously believed.Health effects from the chemicals can be difficult to specify in part because people may be exposed in different ways and at different stages of development and because there are so many types of PFAS chemicals with types and uses that have changed over time.Most people in the United States have been exposed to some PFAS, and some may be at higher risk, such as industrial workers involved in making PFAS and people who live near those facilities. There’s ongoing research to determine how different levels of exposure to PFAS chemicals might lead to various health effects.Experts say it’s important for people to understand their risk of exposure through tap water. Water filters may help somewhat if tap water is contaminated, and there are moves to regulate some PFAS chemicals in US drinking water.Previously, there was limited information on exactly how much PFAS chemicals are in residential tap water, said the authors of the research, published in July 2023 in the journal Environmental International. They added that this study is the most comprehensive to date that includes both private wells and public water sources.The scientists collected water samples directly from taps at 716 locations — 269 from private wells and 447 from public sources — between 2016 and 2021. Based on their findings, they estimate that at least one PFAS chemical would be detected in 45% of US drinking water samples.Most of the contamination came from water sources near urban areas and in areas that generated PFAS, like manufacturing that uses the chemicals in its products or sites where waste was collected.The highest concentrations of PFAS in drinking water were found in the Great Plains, the Great Lakes, the Eastern Seaboard and Central/Southern California, the study said.Concentrations were similar between private wells and public supplies.PFAS can be found in many places, studies show, so toxicologist Dr. Jamie DeWitt is not surprised that it is in so much drinking water.“There’s been almost no place scientists have looked where they have not found PFAS,” said DeWitt, director of the Environmental Health Sciences Center at Oregon State University’s College of Agricultural Sciences. DeWitt was not involved in the 2023 study.PFAS are found in hundreds of household items. The chemicals are used to make carpets and clothes stain-resistant. They keep food from sticking to pans and food packaging, and they’re good at keeping grease and water from soaking through. PFAS are in mobile phones, commercial airplanes and low-emission vehicles, in the foods you can buy at the farmers market or the grocery store, and in rainwater and dental floss. They’re even in the dust that collects in your home.A 2019 study suggested that PFAS chemicals could be found in 98% of the US population. With that in mind, the new 45% number may sound low, but DeWitt said there could be a couple of factors at play. For one, a number of utilities have been making an effort to remove PFAS from the water. Homeowners could also have filters on their systems that make it so PFAS are not as easily detectable.“I think that’s still a pretty high number, considering,” she said.DeWitt said that it’s important for people to know what’s in their drinking water but that they don’t necessarily need to be scared.“I don’t think people should be afraid, but they should be aware and armed themselves with knowledge so that they can get information that will help them to make decisions,” she said.She recommended looking at your local utility website to get its most recent water report. Utilities will disclose what’s in the water and what they are doing to reduce contaminants.A carbon filter can help, but it has to be changed regularly. If used too long, the filter can become saturated with chemicals and not work as well. Households can also use reverse osmosis filtering systems, but those can be expensive.The EPA has proposed the first national drinking water standards for six PFAS chemicals. The proposed limits set the allowable levels for these chemicals so low that they could not be easily detected.If the standards are finalized, water systems will have to determine whether levels of these PFAS pose a potential risk. They may also need to install treatment or take other actions, the EPA said, and may even need to switch to different water sources.In August 2023, the EPA said it is conducting the “most comprehensive monitoring effort for PFAS ever” at large and midsize public water systems and hundreds of small water systems.If PFAS is in 45% of US water systems, the country will have a lot of work to do, said Dr. Graham Peaslee, a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and concurrent professor of chemistry and biochemistry who does PFAS research at the University of Notre Dame.“I think that we should try our best to work on how to clean this up. My fear is that this is, global warming aside, this is probably the most expensive environmental problem we’re ever going to face,” said Peaslee, who was not involved in the 2023 study. ”There’s nothing that will magically fix it. It’s fairly expensive to clean this up. And it’s a recurring cost, and there’s no permanent solutions to it for any particular utility. It looks frightening.”But the cleanup will have to be done, he said, because these chemicals carry real health consequences, and people can’t exactly avoid drinking water.“It’s really insidious, this poison,” Peaslee said. “We are going to have to get inventive on how to filter it out for all of our days.”"

        "title": "Why do I wake up at 3 a.m. every night?",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Now wide awake from a once peaceful slumber, you roll over to check the clock and find it’s 3 a.m. That’s the same time you woke up last night. And the night before.If that sounds familiar, it’s because nocturnal awakenings happen to a lot of people. Waking up several times throughout the night is a natural occurrence often due to sleep architecture, which are the stages of sleep that one cycles through every night.These awakenings usually only last for anywhere from a few seconds up to a few minutes — if they happen too frequently in one night or there are disruptions to falling back asleep, that could be a problem. Here’s what experts say could help.Sleep architecture refers to the four stages of sleep people cycle through during the night in about 90 to 120-minute intervals, said Dr. Brandon Peters-Mathews, a neurologist with Virginia Mason Franciscan Health in Seattle.The cycle begins with a light sleep that transitions into a deeper sleep, and then into the deepest sleep that occurs in the third stage, often referred to as “slow-wave sleep,” Peters-Mathews said. During the fourth stage, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, brain activity picks up to levels that almost reach normal activity while awake — it’s after this stage when people often wake up naturally, he said, and once they fall back asleep the cycle begins again.“Because we tend to go to bed at roughly the same time on a nightly basis, and these cycles are roughly the same length, we may wake at the same time in the night,” Peters-Mathews said. Most of these awakenings will be brief and forgettable, but “there might be one or two cycles into the night that we wake up and look at the clock and are aware of the time.”Waking up several times throughout the night is typically not disruptive to one’s health, as long as falling back asleep occurs within about five to 10 minutes, said Dr. Michelle Drerup, director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at the Cleveland Clinic.On the other hand, when people find themselves waking up multiple times within the hour, that could cause a sleep cycle to be fragmented and the individual might not get any deep sleep, Drerup said. These frequent awakenings could be a sign of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or nocturia, she added.When people naturally wake up in the night, they are more likely to remember it happening during the second half of the night. That’s when people typically have longer REM stage, light sleep, while the first half of the night has longer stages of deep sleep instead.“People will say, ‘Oh, I sleep like really solidly for four hours. And then I feel like I have more waking. And that’s also very normal based on our sleep architecture,” Drerup said.It’s often a person’s emotional response to the awakening that can pose challenges, Peters-Mathews said, and could result in someone developing secondary insomnia if their reaction triggers prolonged wakefulness.“If somebody wakes in the night, and the first thing they do is look to their alarm clock, and see what time it is, and that’s something that makes them feel frustrated or upset or anxious as they anticipate the next day — it’s the reaction that’s problematic,” he said.A person’s circadian rhythm, or internal biological 24-hour clock, could also be at play, said neurologist Dr. Cathy Goldstein, a sleep medicine physician at the Michigan Medicine Sleep Disorders Centers.Your circadian rhythm tells the body when it’s time to sleep and tends to line up with your past sleep-wake cycles and the exposure to light throughout the day. If this rhythm is thrown off, or the sleep-wake cycle changes a lot, the body is not going to have a great idea of when to have high-quality deep sleep, said Goldstein, who is also a ﻿professor of neurology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.“Circadian rhythm is our internal biological clock, it times when we’re awake, it times when we’re asleep — it times most of our physiological processes, so our body does what it needs to do at the right time of day,” Goldstein said.Circadian rhythms and sleep architecture change with age, which might be why someone could feel like they received more deep sleep when they were younger. As people age, they tend to spend more time in light stages of sleep, she added.These cycles are inherent and might also establish someone as a night owl or an early bird, Goldstein said, and could cause difficulty with keeping up with a work schedule that does not align with an individual’s biological cycle, resulting in daytime sleepiness.Often, even though someone wakes up early for work, falling asleep at a time that allows them for enough sleep can be a challenge. What’s more, many night owls also tend to go to bed late on the weekend, which can result in drowsiness known as “social jetlag” and will weaken the circadian rhythm — possibly causing less deep sleep and resulting in more awakenings, Goldstein said. But there are ways to move around your internal clock.Falling asleep and waking up at the same time every day, as well as getting natural light exposure throughout the day and dimming artificial lights at night, will help strengthen your circadian amplitude — the peaks and troughs of the cycle — Goldstein said, resulting in more restful sleep.It could also be helpful to take a very low dosage of melatonin, no more than half a milligram, a few hours before someone tends to naturally fall asleep, which could help to move the body clock earlier, she added.The most important thing to do when waking up in the middle of the night is to resist looking at the clock, Peters-Mathews said. “If the alarm is not going off, it’s not time to wake up. It doesn’t matter what time it is. You get to roll over, get comfortable and go back to sleep.”If you don’t fall back asleep within 15 minutes, it’s best to get out of bed to avoid developing an association with wakefulness with your bed, Drerup said. She recommends doing a quiet activity that will help one feel sleepy again, which could be meditation or listening to music.“Our brains are highly associative, and they can get easily conditioned so that if we stay in bed for a long time, and we’re awake, our brains start to associate the bed with wakeful activities, like worrying and doing all kinds of things besides sleep, so getting out of bed breaks that association,” Drerup said.It’s also important to ensure the awakenings are not happening from something external, such as disturbances from your sleep partner, Peters-Mathews said. “Optimizing the sleep environment is important. … It sometimes means locking pets out of the bedroom and optimizing noise, light and temperature within the bedroom environment.”But if the awakening is naturally caused by your sleep architecture and does not affect how you function the next day, there is nothing to worry about, Goldstein said."

        "title": "Cold water immersion benefits are not backed by quality science, report says",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "A systematic review of scientific studies on the Wim Hof method of cold water therapy found the quality of the research inadequate to support most claims of effectiveness without addition investigation.Wim Hof, a Dutch extreme athlete and motivational speaker, is well-known for his ability to withstand the cold.“It must be noted that the quality of the studies is very low, meaning that all the results must be interpreted with caution,” according to the analysis published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One.Hof attributes his success to his training method, which focuses on a commitment to practicing cold water therapy with a specific form of breathing. The training reduces stress, improves sleep, bolsters the immune system, and increases energy, focus and willpower, according to Hof.While some research did hint at “promising” anti-inflammatory effects from a combination of cold water immersion and the Wim Hof method of breathing, “more research of higher quality” would be needed to verify that finding, the researchers noted.“As revealed by the review, the science is too weak/biased to conclude what the Wim Hof method achieves,” said cold water survival expert Mike Tipton, professor of human and applied physiology at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom, in an email. He was not involved in the study.Known as “The Iceman,” Hof has swum under ice for 66 meters (72 yards), run a half-marathon barefoot in the snow and climbed Mount Everest without a shirt on. According to the Guinness World Records Hall of Fame, Hof has earned 18 Guinness World Records titles, often beating his own records to do so.Other health benefits listed on Hof’s website, which have not undergone scientific validation in large, clinical trials, include increasing sports performance, reducing recovery time after workouts, improving blood pressure, providing pain relief, boosting the body’s metabolism, overcoming multiple sclerosis, and providing relief from arthritis, asthma, autoimmune disease, fibromyalgia and post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome.The review examined eight randomized clinical trials — considered the gold standard of research — but found the small sample size ranging from 13 to 40 mostly male participants in each study hindered the ability to generalize the results to other populations.In addition, Tipton said, studies in the review did not compare the impact of ice water with any other physical activity such as indoor swimming, yoga or walking.“We have no idea what, if any, ‘active ingredient’ is in the Wim Hof method. We have no idea if any benefits arising from the Wim Hof method could not be obtained more safely by other means,” Tifton said. “I do not agree that anyone can do things like cold water immersion.”Submerging the body in cold water is not advised for a range of medical conditions, Tipton said. Those include asthma, high blood pressure, cardiac rhythm disturbances or any heart disease, unstable diabetes, seizure disorders such as epilepsy, and a family history of sudden or unexplained cardiac death.“We acknowledge the need for more high-quality research to substantiate the Wim Hof Method’s promising effects,” a spokesperson for Hof told CNN via email. “It’s our ongoing commitment to collaborate with the scientific community to conduct larger, more inclusive studies that address these concerns.”Cold water drains heat from the body up to four times faster than cold air, according to the National Weather Service. “When your body hits cold water, ‘cold shock’ can cause dramatic changes in breathing, heart rate and blood pressure,” the service’s website says. “The sudden gasp and rapid breathing alone (create) a greater risk of drowning even for confident swimmers in calm waters.”Yet the popularity of cold water therapy has exploded, with many people immersing themselves in home-based ice baths and cold showers as well as open water swims and dips, Tipton said.“Wim Hof is encouraging people to get more physical which, at a time of increasing illness associated with a sedentary lifestyle, is a good thing, provided it is done safely,” Tipton said.For anyone wanting to give the method a try, Tipton published a list of tips in September 2022 on how to do so safely.First, get a thorough medical checkup.“A recent study suggests that up to 43% of drownings are associated with pre-existing medical conditions,” Tipton said. “Pharmaceutical therapies, both acute and chronic, can alter an individual’s response to CWI (cold water immersion) and their perception of cold.”Only swim on a beach with lifeguards and others, he noted, and be sure to check the forecast to avoid dangers such as rip currents. Wear a visible hat, take a tow float and consider a thermal wet suit for buoyancy.Acclimate to the water by starting the process in warmer weather. As the water becomes colder, enter slowly, allowing the shock to dissipate before submerging your body. Avoid holding your breath; don’t stay in colder water longer than 10 minutes; and don’t rely on how you feel, as that can be “dangerously unreliable,” Tipton said. If you get into trouble, float on your back.Once you exit the water, dry and dress quickly in warm clothing with a windproof outer layer and avoid driving a car for at least 30 minutes after the swim."

        "title": "Bottled water packed with nanoplastics, study finds",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "In a trailblazing study, researchers have discovered bottled water sold in stores can contain 10 to 100 times more bits of plastic than previously estimated — nanoparticles so infinitesimally tiny they cannot be seen under a microscope.At 1,000th the average width of a human hair, nanoplastics are so teeny they can migrate through the tissues of the digestive tract or lungs into the bloodstream, distributing potentially harmful synthetic chemicals throughout the body and into cells, experts say.One liter of water — the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters — contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles from seven types of plastics, of which 90% were identified as nanoplastics and the rest were microplastics, according to the study.Microplastics are polymer fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) down to 1/25,000th of an inch (1 micrometer). Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter.“This study, I have to say, is exceedingly impressive. The body of work that they put into this was really quite profound. … I would call it groundbreaking,” said Sherri “Sam” Mason, director of sustainability at Penn State Behrend in Erie, Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the study.The finding reinforces long-held expert advice to drink tap water from glass or stainless steel containers to reduce exposure, Mason said. That advice extends to other foods and drinks packaged in plastic as well, she added.“People don’t think of plastics as shedding but they do,” she said. “In almost the same way we’re constantly shedding skin cells, plastics are constantly shedding little bits that break off, such as when you open that plastic container for your store-bought salad or a cheese that’s wrapped in plastic.”Mason was the coauthor of a 2018 study that first detected the existence of micro- and nanoplastics in 93% of samples of bottled water sold by 11 different brands in nine countries.In that past study, Mason found each tainted liter of water held an average of 10 plastic particles wider than a human hair, along with 300 smaller particles. Five years ago, however, there was no way to analyze those tiny flecks or discover if there were more.“It’s not that we didn’t know nanoplastics existed. We just couldn’t analyze them,” Mason explained.In the recent study, published in January 2024 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from Columbia University presented a new technology that can see, count and analyze the chemical structure of nanoparticles in bottled water.Instead of 300 per liter, the team behind the latest study found the actual number of plastic bits in three popular brands of water sold in the United States to be in between 110,000 and 370,000, if not higher. (The authors declined to mention which brands of bottled water they studied.)However, the new technology was actually able to see millions of nanoparticles in the water, which could be “inorganic nanoparticles, organic particles and some other plastic particles not among the seven major plastic types we studied,” said coauthor and environmental chemist Beizhan Yan, an associate research professor at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.The innovative new techniques presented in the study open the door for further research to better understand the potential risks to human health, said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, an alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors committed to reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals, who was not involved in the study.“They suggest widespread human exposures to minuscule plastic particles posing largely unstudied risks,” Houlihan said in an email. “Infants and young children may face the greatest risks, as their developing brains and bodies are often more vulnerable to impacts from toxic exposures.”Nanoplastics are the most worrisome type of plastic pollution for human health, experts say. That’s because the minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, potentially interrupting cellular processes and depositing endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenols, phthalates, flame retardants, per- and polyfluorinated substances, or PFAS, and heavy metals.“All of those chemicals are used in the manufacturing of plastic, so if a plastic makes its way into us, it’s carrying those chemicals with it. And because the temperature of the body is higher than the outside, those chemicals are going to migrate out of that plastic and end up in our body,” Mason said.“The chemicals can be carried to your liver and your kidney and your brain and even make their way across the placental boundary and end up in an unborn child,” Mason said.In studies of pregnant mice, researchers have found plastic chemicals in the brain, heart, liver, kidney and lungs of the developing baby 24 hours after the pregnant mother ingested or breathed in plastic particles, said study coauthor Phoebe Stapleton, associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Rutgers University’s Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy in Piscataway, New Jersey.“Micro and nanoplastics have been found in the human placenta at this point, Stapleton said. “They’ve been found in human lung tissues. They’ve been found in human feces; they’ve been found in human blood.”In addition to the chemicals and toxic metals plastics may carry, another relatively unstudied area is whether the plastic polymer itself is also harming the body.“The new frontier in plastics is understanding the polymers — the plastic part of plastic,” Mason said. “We’ve been very limited in our ability to understand the potential impact of the polymers on human health because we have not been able to detect down to that level. Now, with this new approach, we will be able to start doing so.”CNN reached out to the International Bottled Water Association, which represents the industry, for a response to the study’s findings.“This new method needs to be fully reviewed by the scientific community and more research needs to be done to develop standardized methods for measuring and quantifying nanoplastics in our environment,” a spokesperson for the association told CNN via email.“There currently is both a lack of standardized methods and no scientific consensus on the potential health impacts of nano- and microplastic particles. Therefore, media reports about these particles in drinking water do nothing more than unnecessarily scare consumers.”The study’s new method of identifying nanoparticles in bottled water relies on a modified version of Raman spectroscopy, a laser-based technique that can analyze the chemical composition of cells by measuring how molecules vibrate in response to light.The altered version, called stimulated Raman scattering microscopy, or SRS, adds a second laser to “amplify the previous signal by several orders of magnitude, allowing the previously unseen nanoparticle to be detected,” said senior author Wei Min, a professor of chemistry at Columbia University in New York City, who coinvented SRS in 2008.“This study is the first one to apply this microscopy to the nanoplastic world,” Min said.By dramatically boosting the image, SRS can clearly identify and capture images of nanoparticles in microseconds rather than the hours needed by the older technique — and do so without harming the tissues being imaged.“But seeing the particles is not good enough because how do you know this is plastic or not? To do that we developed a new machine-based learning technology that allows us to identify and classify which plastic it is,” Yan said.At the time of publication, the study’s algorithm was able to identify seven types of plastics: polyamide, polypropylene, polyethylene, polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate.“Based on other studies we expected most of the microplastics in bottled water would come from leakage of the plastic bottle itself, which is typically made of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic,” said lead author Naixin Qian, a doctoral student in chemistry at Columbia University.“However, we found there’s actually many diverse types of plastics in a bottle of water, and that different plastic types have different size distributions,” she said. “The PET particles were larger, while others were down to 200 nanometers, which is much, much smaller.”Studies have found that particles of PET plastics can be broken off by repeatedly opening and closing the cap of the bottle, crushing the bottle or subjecting it to heat, such as in a car.Now that nanoplastics can be identified and classified, it’s possible to research the answer to all sorts of questions. For example, if the nanoplastics floating in the bottled water weren’t from the bottle itself, where did they come from? The Columbia team is investigating a hypothesis that the other nanoplastics may come from source water, perhaps tainted by some part of the manufacturing process.Another important question: Which has fewer nanoplastics and chemical residues, bottled or tap water?“Several studies have reported lower microplastic levels in tap water. Hence, it’s plausible to expect lower nanoplastic levels in tap water as well, considering their common sources,” Yan said. “We’re conducting research on that right now.”What happens once the plastic polymer and the endocrine-disrupting chemicals enter the body’s cells? Do the invaders remain, wreaking havoc by disrupting or damaging cellular processes, or does the body succeed in kicking them out?“We know these microparticles are getting into the body, and we know even greater percentages of the smaller nanoparticles are getting into cells, but we don’t know exactly where they’re going in the cell or what they are doing,” Stapleton said. “And we don’t know if or how they’re getting back out again.”However, the new technology is well-suited to analyzing human tissue samples and should soon provide some answers, Min said.“If you look at our raw data, it’s actually a series of images,” Min said. “In fact, we have plenty of data to show if a particle has entered a particular location in a certain type of cell, then we will be able to locate it precisely in space.”While science explores these and other questions, there are things people can do to reduce their exposure to plastics, said Healthy Babies, Bright Futures’ Houlihan.“We can avoid consuming foods and beverages in plastic containers. We can wear clothing made from natural fabrics and buy consumer products made from natural materials,” Houlihan said. “We can simply take stock of the plastic in our daily lives and find alternatives whenever feasible.”"

        "title": "Can’t sleep without your partner? Here’s what to do about it",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Over the last few years, couples going through a “sleep divorce” has been all the rage — or just the realization that partnered sleep isn’t always the harmonious thing people think it should be. But what if you actually have trouble falling asleep or sleeping when your partner isn’t there?That’s also common, especially among people whose partners have passed away, said Dr. Wendy Troxel, a Utah-based clinical psychologist and senior behavioral and social scientist at the RAND Corporation.Some of the reasons this happens have to do with the partner alone, while others are more about the bedtime routine you have with them, which might be more conducive to sleep than the one you have without them.“There has been so much focus on couples sleeping apart but it was sort of missing the other part of the story about why many couples do prefer to sleep together and why there tends to be this psychological drive to sleep with a person,” Troxel, author of “Sharing the Covers: Every Couple’s Guide to Better Sleep,” said. “At the basic level, sleeping together provides a sense of safety and security, which can really facilitate healthy sleep.”The sound of a partner’s breathing, the weight and warmth of their body next to you, and the feeling of being more secure and protected — especially for women — all can put your mind at ease, a necessary state for good sleep, she said.“Our brains want to feel safe and secure in order to fall asleep, and one of the best ways to feel safe and secure is to have relatively predictable routines and environments,” Troxel said.There’s also the positive physiological effect of cuddling, holding hands or having sex before falling asleep, which can stimulate feel-good hormones such as oxytocin, which is stress-reducing, Troxel said.Doing these activities likely also mean you’re spending less time on screens before sleep, said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, associate professor of clinical medicine at Huntington Health in Pasadena, California. Sleep experts recommend turning off screens at least half an hour before going to bed.Additionally, “partners also become part of the ritual and routine of going to bed,” Troxel said.The routine aspect is key for a good night’s rest, since it helps regulate our circadian rhythms and signal to our brains that it’s time for sleep, experts said.When you’re missing out on that shared experience with your partner and feeling less safe, that can increase your stress levels, experts said.“Sometimes it is possible that a person may feel the need to master sleeping alone, even though they prefer to sleep with their partner — just for the sake of logistics and continuity when their partner isn’t there,” said Dr. Joshua Tal, a New York City-based clinical psychologist specializing in sleep issues.One of the problems in trying to improve your sleep health alone is that the partner typically isn’t gone long enough for you to substantially develop the skill of sleeping independently, Tal added.“After a couple of nights of not sleeping well, you will sleep. So, it’s important to give yourself a chance to experiment without the person in order to learn that you can sleep properly without them,” Tal said.Whether you take more time for yourself to practice or not, there are things you can try to obtain the comfort you need and make sleeping alone easier.Those can include stretching, yoga, meditation, a warm shower, aromatherapy or breathing techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation, 4-7-8 breathing or diaphragmatic breathing, experts said.If you need to feel your partner’s presence in some way, keep near you a photo of them or an object that has their smell, Tal said. Maybe that’s one of their recently worn shirts or a pillow with their cologne or perfume sprayed on it.A body pillow can help replace their weight in the bed, Troxel said.If you’re anxious about the room feeling too quiet without the sound of your partner’s breathing, “fans or using white noises are really good for simulating breathing noises,” Tal said.Some couples sleep apart — or at least start the night that way — because of different sleep habits even though they want to sleep together.If you’re a morning person but your partner’s a night owl, perhaps they could cuddle with you in time for you to fall asleep, then quietly leave the room to do whatever they please until they’re ready for sleep, Troxel said.If your bodies don’t agree on the bedding or mattress, try using different blankets. If you have the means, two mattresses of a different firmness can be pushed together, or you could look into a mattress with technology that allows different textures and elevation levels on separate sides.Some couples have a habit of calling to say good night right before sleep, but for some people this can be more harmful than helpful if it increases feelings of longing and loneliness rather than comfort, Troxel said. Pay attention to what works for you.And of course there’s the age-old guidance for a healthy sleep routine, Dasgupta said. It’s important to not eat or drink alcohol or caffeine too late; to have a cool, dark and quiet environment; and to wake and sleep at the same times on a regular basis, he added.Doing all these things even while your partner is there can make your chances of maintaining a healthy sleep routine even better, experts said."

        "category": "health",
        "text": "What happens when others assume people with Down syndrome can’t hit hard, aim high or drink a darn margarita?Well, it can become a reality.A new Down syndrome awareness ad cuts right to the philosophical heart of this often-misunderstood condition, reminding us that the way we treat people with Down syndrome can help smash false limits — or reinforce them.False limits like, say, someone of-age not being able to drink just because they have Down syndrome.“If your assumptions become reality, then assume I can drink a margarita. So you serve me a margarita, so I drink a margarita,” says actress Madison Tevlin in the now-viral ad.The same goes for things like living alone, having sex or any other achievement, both great and small.“Assume that I can, so maybe I will,” the spot concludes.The ad, created by an Italian Down syndrome organization called Coor Down, was released in recognition of World Down Syndrome Awareness Day, March 21. Its tagline, #AssumeICan, is being used by people with Down Syndrome to show that many of the assumptions about their drive and abilities are just that … assumptions.Tevlin, the 22-year-old actress who starred in the ad, talked to CNN about tearing down stereotypes while also celebrating the differences people with Down syndrome bring to the table.“When I was born, the doctor told my mom and dad that life would be really hard for me, saying that I can’t talk, or walk, or dance, or model, or act — or drinking or getting married — any of this stuff that’s part of normal life,” she said. “And it’s so much fun proving people wrong.”Tevlin was connected to the Coor Down campaign through the National Down Syndrome Society, and says she’s loving the reactions to the ad, which has 160,000 views on YouTube and has been burning up social media feeds.“I’m just so happy everyone looks up to me as a role model.”Other Down syndrome activists and achievers are sharing their own ways they defy stereotypes, like 17-year-old triathlete Caleb Prewitt, or members of the Hijinx Theatre, an inclusive theatre company in Wales.Down syndrome is a condition caused by an extra partial or full chromosome. According to the National Down Syndrome Society, one in 772 babies in the US is born with Down Syndrome. It’s not a disease or an affliction, it’s just the way some people are made.While Down syndrome results in slight cognitive delays, the NDSS says these issues are usually “mild to moderate” and don’t affect people’s ability to vote, contribute to their communities or make decisions about their own lives.As an actress and advocate, Tevlin has taken control of her own life. She says getting past stereotypes about Down syndrome allows the whole person to shine through.“I always say that I have Down syndrome, and it’s the least interesting thing about me,” she said. “The part of who I am, well it’s not all of me. We should all celebrate our differences in our own special and unique ways.”CNN’s Taylor Galgano and Krista Bo contributed to this report."

Time to chop an onion.Onions are flavorful and an essential part of so many dishes, but that sting in your eyes may make them not feel worth it.Everyone claims to have the best trick to cut back on tears when cutting onions, but CNN talked to experts to see which ones are worth their salt.That stinging feeling in your eyes serves a purpose for onions, said Dr. Abbey Thiel, a food scientist and host of the YouTube channel Abbey the Food Scientist.“It’s really the plant’s defense mechanism to prevent it from being eaten,” Thiel said. Many plants have ways to avoid becoming lunch, such as thorns, spines or a bitter taste, she added.An onion’s defenses come from its cell structure, which has different ﻿compartments to separate substances that could have a reaction, she said.When you damage those cells — such as with a knife — an enzyme and an amino acid are combined to form sulfur compounds and another enzyme that sends vapor into the air and eventually to your eyes, said Dr. Bryan Quoc Le, faculty research fellow at Pacific Lutheran University in Parkland, Washington.“After reacting with the moisture in our eyes, small amounts of sulfuric acid are produced which irritates the cornea and leads to the tears,” Thiel said via email.A great method for producing﻿ less tears when chopping onions is placing a fan near you to blow the air near the vegetable away, Thiel said.“This way the wind carries away the molecules that usually enter your eye and lead to the tears,” she said.Yes, they look dorky, but goggles are a foolproof method, Thiel said. They protect your eyes from the molecules in the air, she said.“I’ve noticed that wearing contacts (instead of glasses) makes a big difference when I’m cutting an onion,” Thiel said. “You just want to have some type of shield protecting your eyes.”The fridge, freezer or a bowl of icy water can also help, Le said.Freezing, like microwaving, can change the texture of the onion, so only use that method when you are making something such as a soup, he said.And storing onions in the refrigerator can dampen their﻿ flavor, Le said. Instead, keep your onions in a cool, dry place and pop them in the refrigerator or in cold water about 20 minutes before it’s time to chop, he said.Heat can help cut down on the vapors, so you could microwave an onion before cutting it, Le said.Depending on the size of the onion, it should take anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes, he added.But Le only recommends doing this if you are making something where the onion’s texture isn’t that important because using the microwave can interfere with the crispness of the onion.Acids added to your onions may help reduce the stinging in your eyes and increase the flavor for your taste buds, Le said.The enzyme that converts amino acids in onions to cause the stinging feeling works well at a specific pH range, he said. An acid such as lemon or vinegar will slow down the enzyme making the vapors that lead to tears.Slowing the onion’s tear-inducing enzyme has another perk: It keeps the amino acid intact that gives the onion its flavor-enhancing ability in a recipe, Le said.Some people swear by lighting a candle while they cut up an onion. It’s possible that doing so could work, Le said.“I could see that working, but it really just depends on the kind of candle,” Le said. It could block the vapors, or a scented candle could have a reaction with the vapors that’s helpful.But it isn’t a guaranteed method, he added.“Maybe it’ll distract you with the nice-smelling ﻿odor,” Thiel said.Does it work to hold a piece of bread or toast in your mouth to avoiding crying or stop the tears? It’s hard to say, said Le, who is also the author of “150 Food Science Questions Answered.”Some people may find that this method cuts down on the stinging, teary feeling, but it is not one you can count on to work every time, he said.Le said he isn’t sure about the theory behind it. It could be the bread absorbing the vapor, or it could be psychological, he said."

        "title": "Toxic plastic chemicals number in the thousands, most are unregulated, report finds",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "“Life in plastic; it’s fantastic,” so the song goes, but in reality, plastics and the chemicals used to create them have been increasingly linked to numerous harms to human health and the environment. And with new plastic chemicals entering the market all the time, it’s been difficult for regulators and policy makers to determine the scope of the problem.Now, for the first time, researchers have pulled together scientific and regulatory data to develop a database of all known chemicals used in plastic production.It’s a staggering number: 16,000 plastic chemicals, with at least 4,200 of those considered to be “highly hazardous” to human health and the environment, according to the authors.“Only 980 of those highly hazardous chemicals have been regulated by agencies around the world, leaving us with 3,600 chemicals that are unregulated — and these are only the known chemicals,” said Martin Wagner, first author and project lead of the PlastChem Report, released Thursday.“There are many more unregulated chemicals that we’re just unaware of how they may be hazardous to our own health or the environment,” said Wagner, an associate professor of biology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim.The report is an important one, said pediatrician and biology professor Dr. Philip Landrigan, director of the Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good and the Global Observatory on Planetary Health at Boston College.“It’s the most comprehensive catalog of the chemicals in plastics that I’ve seen today,” said Landrigan, who was not involved in the report’s creation.Landrigan, however, was the lead author of a massive undertaking by the Minderoo – Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health, a global consortium of scientists, health care workers and policy analysts charged with following plastics from creation to final product.In its March 2023 report, the consortium determined that “plastics are associated with harms to human health at every single stage of the plastic lifecycle,” Landrigan said.“This new report underscores what we found: Plastics pose a very real threat to human health,” he added. “The plastics and the chemicals in them require a much tighter regulation than they have had up until now.”Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, told CNN in an email that “plastic as a material continues to offer safety, protection and efficiency while also being able to be reused and recycled. Chemicals are chemicals, and policies should be developed that are applicable to all of them. Trying to focus exclusively on ‘plastics chemicals’ risks redundancy and tunnel vision in policy.”Kimberly Wise White, vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs for the American Chemistry Council, told CNN in email that “unfortunately, today’s report seeks to advance a hazard framework that ignores real-world exposures and paints an incomplete picture for regulators and the public. This contrasts with risk assessments, used to underpin the most effective chemical management laws.”The PlastChem Report report outlines a systematic approach to identify and prioritize chemicals of concern that can be used by agencies and regulators around the world, including those attending the April meeting of the International Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution. The committee is part of the United Nations Environment Programme, which has committed to developing a Global Plastics Treaty between 175 nations by the end of 2024.“The most important criterion we used is toxicity,” Wagner said. “Many of these chemicals are known to be very toxic for human health or the environment. They are carcinogenic or mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. Some have organ-specific toxicity, typically the liver, as that is where many of the chemicals are absorbed from circulation.”Other chemicals like phthalates, bisphenols, flame retardants and pesticides are also endocrine disruptors, interfering with the body’s hormones and contributing to obesity, low birth weight, gestational diabetes, some cancers, birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders, Wagner said.In addition to toxicity, the report characterized chemicals of concern by how long they stayed in the environment or the human body, Wagner said.“The chemicals of concern we identified are also persistent, in that they don’t easily degrade in the environment; bio-accumulative, meaning they build up in the body over time; and mobile, which means they spread easily in drinking water or in the aquatic environment,” he added.Scientific studies are often criticized by the plastic industry as not being specific or as able to show only an association, not cause and effect, due to ethical concerns about experimenting on humans. To alleviate that concern, the researchers mined data from regulatory agencies around the world that had already flagged a chemical as potentially hazardous.“Our report is not only based on the scientific evidence in the literature but also on regulatory agencies saying ‘this chemical is likely to cause cancer or have another toxic impact.’ It’s a quite conservative approach to identifying plastics of concern,” Wagner said.Using data from regulatory agencies in addition to scientific research “adds a whole layer of credibility” to the report, Landrigan said.In the United States, the regulatory process requires proof of an individual chemical’s harm before action can be taken. Critics of this approach say this allows industry to change a small molecule in that chemical’s structure, effectively sending scientists back to the lab to prove that the chemical harms the body in the same way as its predecessor.“The chemical industry has become very skilled at this kind of bait and switch,” Landrigan said, even though all of the chemicals in that group will have a similar biological impact on the body.Along with many other advocates, the PlastChem Report suggests bundling similar chemicals into groups that would then be regulated as classes. The report identifies 15 such priority groups, which include familiar names such as bisphenols (BPA and its offspring); phthalates; per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS); and parabens (preservatives).Although grouping would capture about 1,000 of the most toxic chemicals in plastics, Wagner said, that still leaves about 2,600 chemicals that still need to be regulated.In addition to the massive number of toxic chemicals, the report found that detailed hazard information is missing for more than 10,000 of the 16,000 chemicals. Without this information, regulators and the public do not have the data needed to determine whether chemicals may be harming the human body, wildlife and the environment, advocates say.“This report is long overdue. People are exposed to these chemicals daily, highlighting a critical issue where the vast majority have never gone through a hazard or safety assessment,” said Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, an enviromental and health advocacy organization.Stoiber was not involved in the creations of the PlastChem report.“We will never know in full what these chronic exposures mean for our health, but the sheer number of toxic chemicals used in plastics should set off alarm bells,” said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, an alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors with a mission of reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. She was not involved with the new report."

        "title": "US abortions reach highest level in over a decade, sparked by surge in medication abortion",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Abortions are on the rise in the United States, despite bans that have taken effect in more than a dozen states since the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that revoked the federal right to abortion in June 2022.There were more than 1 million abortions in the US in 2023, the highest rate in more than a decade and a 10% jump from 2020, according to a report released Tuesday by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights. The latest trends also suggest that medication abortion is a more common option than ever.Although abortions all but stopped in the 14 states with total bans, nearly every other state had an increase in the number of abortions provided from 2020 to 2023. As the geography of abortion care shifted amid a fractured policy landscape, the 10% increase in abortions nationwide meant that states without total bans saw a 25% increase in those years.The “drastic loss of access in states with bans has been counterbalanced by monumental efforts on the part of clinics, abortion funds and logistical support organizations to help people in ban states access care through financial and practical support,” the authors of the report wrote.States bordering those with bans had particularly large increases, but abortions also increased in other states where they remained legal.“It is very possible that, while access was dramatically curtailed for people living in ban states, access substantially improved for residents of states without bans,” the authors wrote.In addition to states policies enacted to protect patients and access to care and increased financial support from abortion funds, researchers from the Guttmacher Institute suggest that improved access to telehealth in recent years may have made medication abortion more broadly available.Medication abortion has become more common than ever post-Roe, according to another new Guttmacher report. Nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the US in 2023 – an estimated 642,700 – were medication abortions, the report says.Medication abortion, also known as medical abortion, is a method by which someone ends their pregnancy by taking two pills – mifepristone and misoprostol – rather than having a surgical procedure.This option has become steadily more common over the two decades it’s been available, rising from less than 10% of all abortions in the US in 2001 to 53% in 2020 and 63% in 2023.But mifepristone, the drug that was approved for abortion use by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2000, faces an unprecedented legal challenge. On March 26, the US Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case that puts access to the medication at stake – even in states where abortion remains legal – and raises questions about the authority that courts have to overrule determinations by FDA experts about a drug’s safety.Misoprostol can be used on its own for a medication abortion and is a safe alternative, but research suggests that using both pills together is the gold standard.Research has long found that medication abortion is safe and effective, but another recent study found that to be true even when the patient gets the medicine through a telehealth appointment.“Any return to restrictions on medication abortion provision via telemedicine would be detrimental for people who either prefer or only have access to abortion using telemedicine,” the Guttmacher researchers wrote in the new report. “While the current court case only affects use of mifepristone — and a misoprostol-only regimen is also a safe and effective method of medication abortion — everyone seeking an abortion should have access to the full range of safe, effective options.”The new reports from Guttmacher estimate abortion trends based on responses from a sample of abortion providers in the US. They probably undercount the number of abortions in the US, as the data does not include abortions that happen outside of the formal health care system or medication abortions that were sent to people in states where abortion is banned.CNN’s Jen Christensen and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report."

        "title": "A lifesaving therapy for children with a rare disease is now the world’s most expensive drug, raising questions about access",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "A new gene therapy for the fatal genetic disorder metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD, will carry a wholesale price of $4.25 million, its manufacturer announced Wednesday, making it the world’s most expensive medicine.Lenmeldy was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday and is the first therapy for the rare and devastating disease, which typically kills affected children before they turn 7. About 40 children are born with MLD in the US each year.The wholesale cost isn’t usually what patients pay, but it’s a cost that’s considered and shouldered by public and private health insurance plans, including state Medicaid plans, which cover roughly 4 out of every 10 children in the United States.Manufacturers of gene therapies say the big prices reflect big benefits — the chance to be free of a disabling or even fatal disease — and they point out that they need to be able to recoup the steep costs of development, testing and manufacturing their products.Health policy experts say that as the list of gene and cell therapies with eye-popping prices grows, it may strain the ability of states and other insurers to cover their costs, and ultimately limit patient access if plans begin to exclude these therapies as a class from coverage.Dr. Bobby Gaspar, the co-founder and CEO of Orchard Therapeutics, the company that makes Lenmeldy, said the treatment is “paradigm-shifting medicine and has the potential to stop or slow the progression of this devastating childhood disease with a single treatment.”“We are committed to enabling broad, expedient and sustainable access to this important therapy for eligible patients with early-onset MLD in the U.S.,” Gaspar said in a statement.Lenmeldy takes stem cells from someone with MLD and uses a harmless virus to insert working copies of a faulty gene. The repaired cells are then infused back to the patient, where they begin to produce an enzyme that’s lacking in children who have the disease. Some of the cells eventually migrate to the bone marrow, where they continue to live and make new cells that also make the enzyme, providing a long-lasting benefit to patients.The first patients treated with Lenmeldy have now been followed for more than 12 years, and researchers continue to find gene-modified cells making the missing enzyme, said Orchard Therapeutics’ Gaspar.“We can’t say at the moment that this will last a lifetime, but what we can say is that there is a longterm durable effect,” Gaspar said.MLD is an inherited disorder, and children born with it lack an enzyme needed break down fatty substances called sulfatides. The build-up of these fatty materials eventually becomes toxic to nerves, leading to the progressive loss of movement and thinking.Babies with MLD develop normally for a time and but then typically begin to lose the ability to walk and talk around age 2. The disease advances rapidly, causing children to deteriorate into a vegetative state.“We are over the moon regarding what this means for other families,” said Kendra Riley, 41, of Phoenix, who has two children with MLD.For their family, the FDA’s action this week was bittersweet.Riley’s 5-year-old daughter, Olivia, is in hospice after being diagnosed with MLD as a toddler.Riley says the first clues that something was wrong came when Olivia was around the age of 2. She began to have trouble walking, and her head started to regularly tilt to the side when she would watch TV.“We thought we just needed some physical therapy,” Riley said.“Then the irises of her eyes started vibrating. That’s when we knew something else was going on.”By the time doctors diagnosed Olivia with MLD, it was too late for the gene therapy to help. But knowing that the condition is inherited, they were able to get their younger daughter, Keira, tested and diagnosed.Keira, now 4, was the 32nd child in the world to get the therapy, which is most effective before children show symptoms.The treatment wasn’t yet available in the United States, so the family crowdsourced donations to temporarily relocate to Italy in 2020 to get the therapy. It cost them about $500,000 to live abroad and pay for Keira’s medical care, even though the company provided the gene therapy for free.“Having this FDA-approved therapy means that if a child does get diagnosed before symptom onset, they have a chance at normal life,” Riley said.“She is doing amazing. Zero symptoms,” she said of Keira. “You would never know.”The Boston nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, or ICER, which evaluates the cost effectiveness of new drugs, published a final report on Lenmeldy last fall and estimated that the cost of the therapy would match its expected benefits to patients if it was priced between $2.3 million and $3.9 million.Experts agreed that even such hefty price tag would be worth its results. Children with the disease who aren’t treated usually die within five years of their diagnosis; the oldest patient to have the therapy has now been followed for more than 12 years and appears to be developing normally.“It’s taking a child who would have had a miserable short life and likely giving them a normal life. And that’s worth a lot of money,” said Dr. David Rind, the chief medical officer for ICER. “This is one of the more exciting drugs that we’ve looked at.”Still, the Lenmeldy’s price came in hundreds of thousands of dollars higher that even Rind expected.“I think when you get into numbers this big that people don’t necessarily pay attention when it gets a little bigger, but I do think this price is too high,” Rind said.ICER gave a range of $2.29 million to $3.94 million — that doesn’t mean that the top of the range is the right price, said Rind “despite the desire by manufacturers to think of it that way.”“Going $310,000 above the very top of that range is actually a lot of money,” he said.The last product to top the charts on a per-treatment basis was another gene therapy called Hemgenix, which was approved in 2022 to treat a blood clotting disorder called hemophilia B. Its list price was $3.5 million for a one-time treatment.Close behind that one is Elvevidys, which was approved in 2023 for muscular dystrophy at $3.2 million, and Skysona, approved in 2022 for a disease related to MLD called adrenoleukodystrophy, which costs $3 million for a one-time dose.Even with a top tier price, the MLD treatment will not be a blockbuster, Rind noted, because the disease is so rare. Some gene therapies approved for rare diseases have disappeared because the companies that made them couldn’t make enough money to stay in business. Orchard Therapeutics has already struggled to market a previous gene therapy it developed, leaving patients hanging.Edwin Park, a research professor at the McCourt School of Public Health at Georgetown University, worries about the impact to states, which share the cost of covering patients on Medicaid with the federal government.Medicaid requires a minimum rebate from drug manufacturers, but without any competition, there probably won’t be much negotiation about the price of the therapy, Park said.More and more states are closely following drug pipelines after being surprised by the costs of the antiviral medications that cure hepatitis C, he said.But even paying for one or two children to get Lenmeldy a year could be a sizeable cost for some states to absorb.“Unless states have allocated appropriately for it, and looked at the drug pipeline, they may not be prepared for what could be significant cost spikes,” Park said.This latest approval comes as the FDA is working to clear a backlog of cell and gene therapies that have been waiting for its attention since the pandemic. The agency has hired more staff to review the new treatments and set up a new superoffice, the Office of Therapeutic Products, to oversee their regulation.Lenmeldy has been available in Europe since 2020, but it took four more years to bring it to the US.Dr. Nicole Verdun, who was hired to head the new FDA initiative last year, said Lenmeldy’s approval is a sign that things are moving in the right direction.“MLD is a devastating disease that profoundly affects the quality of life of patients and their families,” Verdun said.“This approval represents important progress in the advancement and availability of effective treatments, including gene therapies, for rare diseases.”Dr. Barbara Burton, who is an attending physician, of genetics, genomics and metabolism at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, said it was a watershed moment for doctors, too.“For too long, my colleagues and I have consoled families at their most vulnerable times — usually following an arduous diagnostic odyssey, coping with a dire prognosis and being told there were no treatments, and then having to watch their young child slip away.“With this approval, we are now one significant step closer to ensuring future generations of children, families and healthcare professionals no longer need to experience first-hand the terrible manifestations this disease has on untreated patients,” she said.The approval of a treatment is already leading to new ways to catch the disease earlier.Gaspar, of Orchard Therapeutics, noted that the company was supporting studies of newborn screening tests in the hopes of catching and treating the condition earlier, and screening is happening in some US states.“Over 250,000 babies have been screened them as a result of these initiatives,” Gaspar said, and five babies with MLD have been identified. At least three of those babies have now been treated.Riley said she wishes screening had been available for Olivia. The 5-year-old is stable for now, but Riley said she lives in fear that Keira could bring germs home.“The common cold could kill her,” Riley said. “So every time her sister has come home with a cold from school, that could be potentially something that takes her out.”Olivia can’t walk or talk, and she’s fed through a tube. Riley says she requires round-the-clock care. Physical and occupational therapists come to the house each week “to keep her mind moving. She does understand what’s going on.”She said that as they have watched Olivia slip away, they’ve come to understand that her life has had profound purpose. But they say they hope that the approval of Lenmeldy means that no other families with MLD will have to lose one child to save another.“We’ve always called Livvy ‘Keira’s guardian angel on Earth,’ ” Riley said. “She’s here for a reason.”"

        "title": "Despite symptoms, NIH research finds no evidence of ‘Havana syndrome’ in brain scans",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Researchers with the National Institutes of Health published a pair of studies on Monday that found few clinical differences between patients with a mysterious ailment known as “Havana syndrome” and healthy comparison groups.In one study, NIH researchers took a closer look at the brains of people who were believed to have Havana syndrome and found no consistent evidence of brain injury and no significant differences between that group and a healthy comparison group.In the second study, scientists ran a battery of tests on 86 US government staff and family members who reported Havana syndrome, comparing them with 30 people who had similar jobs but had no such symptoms, and found that by most clinical and biomarker measures, the two groups were the same.The mysterious illness first emerged in late 2016, when a cluster of diplomats stationed in the Cuban capital of Havana began reporting symptoms consistent with head trauma, including dizziness and extreme headaches. In subsequent years, there have been cases reported around the world, including clusters of at least 60 incidents in Bogota, Colombia, and Vienna, Austria. There have been about 1,500 reported cases across the US government in 96 different counties, officials said last year, but the number of reported incidents has dropped significantly in recent years.Despite longstanding speculation that the illness could have been the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US, the US intelligence community said last year that it cannot link any cases to a foreign adversary, ruling it unlikely that the unexplained illness was the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US.But the illness — and its cause — have remained frustratingly opaque to both the intelligence community and the medical community.Dr. David Relman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford who worked on earlier investigations of people with Havana syndrome, argued in an editorial published alongside the research Monday that while the study involving brain scans may appear to show that “nothing, or nothing serious” happened with these cases, coming to this conclusion “would be ill-advised.”Earlier work found evidence of abnormalities, he said, and the same is true for the study that did a wider variety of tests. Because the condition can look different in each person, he said, doctors don’t have specific tests that can fully determine what is wrong with them.“Clearly, new, sensitive, standardized, non-invasive tests of nervous system function, especially involving the vestibular system, are needed, such as more specific blood markers of different forms of cellular injury,” Relman wrote.One problem facing the medical community is that there is still not a clear definition of Havana syndrome — or what the government terms “anomalous health incidents” or AHIs. These tests were done, in some cases, long after symptoms began, making it harder to understand what physically happened.In 2022, an intelligence panel investigating the cause of AHIs said that some of the episodes could “plausibly” have been caused by “pulsed electromagnetic energy” emitted by an external source.But Relman noted that there is a relative lack of information about the biological effects of electromagnetic and acoustic energy on the brain, even if this is what actually triggered the problems in people with Havana syndrome.Some current and former CIA officers have raised concerns that a CIA task force in charge of investigating Havana syndrome soft-pedaled its investigation, CNN has previously reported.And some patients and former officials have said they were treated with skepticism and in some cases outright dismissal by the Trump administration in the months and years following the appearance of the first cases.Despite the uncertainty surrounding the condition, Congress in 2021 passed legislation mandating compensation for CIA and government victims, which the agency began disbursing in 2022.Relman noted that as with any kind of highly publicized clinical syndromes, such as Gulf War syndrome and now Havana syndrome, it is difficult for scientists to deal with “uncertainty, complexity, the need for transdisciplinary approaches, insufficient information or misinformation, and a topic that is politically charged and divisive.”“Going forward, we must address the underlying institutional failures and vulnerabilities that contributed to these outcomes,” Relman writes. He argued for surveillance systems designed to detect early cases across government agencies and objective independent panels to review emerging data.“Prejudice and poorly supported assumptions must be set aside,” he wrote.The neuroimaging study compared the brains of 81 people thought to have Havana syndrome and those of 48 people who had no such health complaints. Twenty-nine members of the comparison group had similar employment as the 81 in the patient group.To look for differences in the participants’ brains, the scientists used imaging known as high-quality diffusion MRI, which doctors typically use to check for conditions such as a stroke, a brain tumor, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. This kind of MRI can visualize white matter fibers in the brain and determine whether the brain matter is normal or if there are problems.When the researchers compared the two groups, they found no significant differences in the structures and measurements of the brains.“These findings suggest that the origin of the symptoms of participants with AHIs may not be linked to an MRI-identifiable injury to the brain,” the study concluded.There are limitations to this research, however. The control group was small and not perfectly matched to those with Havana syndrome. The earliest scans were also conducted within 14 days after the person said they experienced the event that triggered their symptoms, and the results may have been different if done at a different time.The study results differ from previous imaging studies that found evidence of some brain abnormalities, but past studies were done on smaller number of participants.In the second study, researchers tested hearing, balance, eyesight and neuropsychological state, and they looked at blood biomarkers, in the two groups.There were no significant clinical differences between the two groups when it came to their hearing or vision, nor were there differences when the researchers tested the inner ear or checked the blood for certain biomarkers. Cognitive tests were also similar.There were some differences in self-reported symptoms, however, including fatigue, depression, post-traumatic stress, imbalance and some neurobehavioral issues.Headache was a common concern among the participants with Havana syndrome. Most developed daily persistent headaches, the study said, but only eight were diagnosed with new-onset migraines.“While we did not identify significant differences in participants with AHIs, it’s important to acknowledge that these symptoms are very real, cause significant disruption in the lives of those affected and can be quite prolonged, disabling and difficult to treat,” Dr. Leighton Chan, lead author on one of the papers and acting chief scientific officer of the NIH Clinical Center, said in a news release.The authors of the study noted several limitations to their research, including the fact that some of the assessments, though sensitive, are not specific, and some are not used clinically, so it is unclear exactly how impactful they are.There were also no psychiatric evaluations performed. Anxiety, depression pain and fatigue can affect balance, hearing and cognitive testing, so abnormalities can be difficult to interpret.The study concluded that whatever caused Havana syndrome seems to create symptoms “without persistent or detectable physiologic changes. A lack of evidence for a brain injury does not necessarily mean that no injury is present or that it did not occur at the time of the AHI.”“Alternatively, the ‘attack’s’ physiological effects might be so varied and idiosyncratic that they cannot be identified with the current methodologies and sample size,” the study said."

        "title": "Author Lindy West wants you to think about these five things when you meet a ‘fat’ person",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Season 9 of the podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the intersection between body weight and health. We delve into a wide range of topics, including why losing weight is so hard, the new weight loss drugs and how to talk to kids about weight. You can listen here.(CNN) — This is an article about the F-word.No, not that F-word. The other F-word. The one that makes most people uncomfortable to hear but more so to be called it: fat.For more than a decade, author Lindy West and other fat activists have been working to reclaim and destigmatize the term, much like gay activists who have taken back the word queer.For West, it began in 2011 when she penned an essay titled “Hello, I’m Fat.”“There was this way that calling myself fat publicly made me fat,” she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life recently. “Whereas before I was operating, like ‘I am gonna be thin.’ That’s the cultural narrative: that fat people are thin people who are failing. And so, I was bought into that. So that was scary to kind of, in a certain way, announce, ‘I’m throwing in the towel of trying to be this other thing and waiting for my life to start.’”The essay went viral, and West shot to cultural prominence. A memoir, “Shrill: Notes From a Loud Woman,” followed five years later, and it became the basis for the Hulu series “Shrill.” In addition to being a writer and producer, West is cohost of the NPR podcast “Text Me Back.”West explained that she and others in the fat liberation space don’t like the word obese because it unnecessarily medicalizes them. (In 2013, the American Medical Association voted to classify obesity as a disease.)“That’s why I say fat, and I don’t use the word obesity. It is pathologizing, and I don’t have a disease,” she said. “If it’s a disease, then it seems like there would be some kind of unifying factor across all fat people as to why we’re fat, some sort of mechanism for how this disease works — and that’s just not the case.”West added that it reduces people to one dimension. “It flattens fat people into what they want us to be, which is just fat, lazy gluttons,” she said.Listen to more of the conversation with Lindy West by clicking the player below.It hasn’t been easy for West to come to peace with her body, much less to get society to accept her.“Having had my weight fluctuate, I know for a fact that the smaller you are, the nicer people are to you,” she said. “People will be kinder to you. They will take you more seriously. They’re friendlier. They’re more welcoming.“Think about what it’s like to live your life and no one’s ever kind to you. And then you’re also told that this is your fault, and that the fact that you haven’t changed your body in the way that society wants you to, says all these negative things about who you are and your capabilities.”West calls it cruel to treat fellow human beings that badly. “To rob people of basic respect and joy … and participation in the full spectrum of life. So, it doesn’t matter why people are fat, you know, it doesn’t matter,” she said. “You should treat people with respect and kindness, regardless.”What should people keep in mind when interacting with those who have larger bodies? West shares these five thoughts.Work to improve the situation, not just for the sake of plus-size people but for the future you.“You have no guarantees that you will never become fat or disabled,” West said via email. “Do you want to spend your energy making life harder for fat people and disabled people, or do you want to expand systems of care and accessibility to make life better for everyone?“If you can’t do it for other people, can you do it for your potential future self, or your parents, or your children?” she asked.Children need unconditional love, and not necessarily a prescription for one of the new weight loss medications — some of which are approved for kids as young as 12.“(T)here’s not just the physical toll to worry about — both short-term risks and the completely unknown long-term effects — but also the emotional impact,” West said. “It permanently changes you to be taught, when you’re still a child, that your body is something to be ashamed of and something to be changed at all cost. It is a pipeline to disordered eating to tell kids that there’s something wrong with them for listening to their hunger cues.“Kids are still growing, still developing their relationships with food and body. They don’t need to be nauseous all day at school, vomiting up their meals. They don’t need to be hearing the same messaging from their parents that they hear from their bullies at school. Their bodies need nourishment, and their brains need to know that they’re unconditionally valued.”When you encounter someone, understand that you have imperfect and incomplete information and can’t presume to judge this person.“You can’t tell from someone’s body whether they have an eating disorder or not,” West said. “You have no idea what is going on in anyone else’s life, or why anyone’s body looks the way that it does, so the only ethical way to move through the world is to treat everyone with humanity and respect.”To learn more about the pervasive cultural bias against people in larger bodies and how to start deprogramming yourself, crack open one (or all) of these books.“Read: ‘Fearing the Black Body,’ ‘The Body Is Not an Apology,’ ‘Intuitive Eating,’ and both of Aubrey Gordon’s books,” West recommended. (The latter two are “‘You Just Need to Lose Weight’: And 19 Other Myths About Fat People” and “What We Don’t Talk About When We Talk About Fat.”)If you feel the urge to say something — recite the calorie count for a slice of pizza or a plum, give diet advice, share the latest health factoid, offer up praise for exercising or anything else — check yourself. Don’t. Do. It.“Mind your own business and leave fat people alone!” West exhorted. “We’re busy! We have lives and brains! Go away! Go have fun!”She added, “I don’t barge into your life and tell you not to go mountain biking, you weirdo!”We hope these five thoughts help you develop a more compassionate perspective on — as West would say — fat people. Listen to the full episode here. And join us next week on the Chasing Life podcast when we bust some myths about popular weight loss products with Dr. “Mike” Varshavski."

        "title": "As more young people get colon cancer, it may be time for a colonoscopy",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "Editor’s note: Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt is a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and past president of the Florida Urological Society.Colon cancer may seem like a distant concern for some, but with the growing trend of younger people being diagnosed, staying informed and proactive is crucial. March marks Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, a time to educate people about this prevalent and potentially lethal disease on the rise.As a surgeon, I’m acutely aware of the impact cancer can have. I lost a dear friend — a doctor, father and husband, just like myself — to colon cancer in 2017. He was only 38. His memory is a constant reminder of the importance of awareness and early detection in the fight against colon cancer.Just one year after I lost him, I started experiencing sharp abdominal pain and a change in my bowel habits. Never mind that I’m a urologist; I still freaked out and feared the worst. I consulted my doctor and underwent a CT scan, which thankfully showed no major cancers. Still, my doctor recommended that I have a colonoscopy.I was in my 30s, so I didn’t meet the criteria for a screening colonoscopy, but he needed it for diagnostic purposes to complete my workup for abdominal symptoms. Technically the colonoscopy was optional, but with my friend’s memory always on my mind, I did not hesitate.Most people should start screening with colonoscopies by age 45, experts recommend. A select group may need to start earlier than 45; beginning a conversation with your primary doctor can help with a road map on when to start and at what frequency.The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 106,590 new cases of colon cancer in the United States this year, nearly evenly split between men and women. The rate of diagnosis for colon cancer has been dropping overall since the mid-1980s, mainly because people are getting screened and changing lifestyle-related risk factors. However, this downward trend is mostly seen in older adults. For individuals younger than 55, rates have been increasing by 1% to 2% a year since the mid-1990s.Overall, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women. However, each person’s risk might be higher or lower than this, depending on their risk factors for colorectal cancer. Not everyone needs an early colonoscopy, but everyone should be aware of the signs, symptoms and benefits of screening.The colon, or large intestine, plays a crucial role in our digestive system, acting essentially as the waste processing and recycling center of the body. After the stomach and small intestine break down food and absorb nutrients, the colon manages what’s left. Its main job is to remove water and salts from this material, transforming it from a liquid state into solid waste or feces, or as my kids like to call it, poop.Beyond waste management, the colon also houses a complex microbiome, which plays a key role in overall digestive health, immune function and even mood regulation. The entire colon is about 5 feet (150 centimeters) long and divided into five major segments, with the rectum as the last anatomic segment before the anus. That’s why it’s called Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month and not just colon cancer awareness. Cancer can occur in any of these segments, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive colonoscopy when indicated.The preparation for a colonoscopy might be the most memorable part of the process. It’s less of a medical procedure and more of a rite of passage. The day before, you start on a bowel-cleaning cocktail meant to clear out the colon for optimal visualization during the colonoscopy.The “prep” is not as bad as one might think. Dehydration and exhaustion can occur, and I remember being unable to sleep the night before, still feeling the need to “go.” It was quite the experience but essential for a successful colonoscopy.A colonoscope, a camera on a flexible tube, takes a tour through your colon, transmitting live images that allow the doctor to spot any abnormalities. It’s akin to sending a rover to explore the moon or Mars. If doctors find something suspicious, such as a polyp, they can biopsy and/or remove it on the spot, preventing potential future complications. This proactive approach isn’t just diagnostic; it’s a powerful form of prevention that can offer peace of mind and actionable insights into your health.Fortunately for me, the colonoscopy revealed no signs of cancer, and my symptoms had already resolved by then. Although my procedure was primarily for diagnostic reasons, regular screenings are essential for many, serving as a key preventive measure.The US Preventive Services Task Force advises adults ages 45 to 75 to undergo regular colorectal cancer screenings, emphasizing the importance of early detection.Those with an elevated risk, perhaps due to family history or other factors, should consult their health care provider to determine the best screening schedule and methods tailored to their specific needs.Despite these recommendations, a significant portion of the eligible population hesitates to participate in screenings. Common deterrents include the discomfort associated with stool-based tests, the preparation required for procedures, and anxiety surrounding colonoscopy examinations.This apprehension may contribute to only about 60% of those eligible for colorectal cancer screenings staying up to date on the recommended tests. If it weren’t for the memory of my friend, I would have likely been in the “I’ll skip all this” group.In a promising development, a new blood-based screening test for colon cancer boasted an 83% effectiveness in detecting the disease, according to a study published March 13 in The New England Journal of Medicine. This test identifies DNA markers released by cancer cells in the blood, specific to colorectal cancer. While not a replacement for a colonoscopy, a positive result from this test indicates the need for further examination. The hope is, once approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, this blood test would increase screening for colorectal cancer.If you have any abnormal symptoms anywhere in your body, get checked. The earlier you do so, the longer you will likely live thanks to getting proactive care."

        "title": "Two-thirds of young children in Chicago are exposed to dangerous lead levels in water, study finds",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "More than two-thirds of children under the age of 6 in Chicago may be exposed to lead-contaminated water, a new study finds.The study published on Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics analyzed lead exposure based on 38,385 household lead tests collected by the Chicago Department of Water Management between January 2016 and September 2023. The researchers used machine learning, an artificial intelligence technique using algorithms, to estimate lead levels in tap water across Chicago based on this existing data.They found that about 75% of residential city blocks in Chicago had lead-contaminated water. And more than two-thirds – approximately 129,000 – children under the age of 6 in Chicago live on these blocks and may be exposed to lead-contaminated water.“The extent of lead contamination of tap water in Chicago is disheartening—it’s not something we should be seeing in 2024,” Dr. Benjamin Huynh, lead author of the study and assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said in a news release.City blocks with predominantly Black or Hispanic populations were less likely to be tested for lead and more likely to have lead-contaminated drinking water, the study found.“For over 30 years, lead has been the emblematic example of environmental racism. It continues to be children of color or poor children who are disproportionately impacted,” said Dr. Monna Hanna-Attisha, pediatrician and professor at Michigan State University who helped expose the Flint water crisis and who was not involved with this study.The cutoff that researchers used to determine whether a residential block had lead-contaminated drinking water was if the majority of tests within a block had more than 1 part per billion (ppb) of lead concentration. There is no safe level of lead in water, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.The EPA’s current “action level” for lead in drinking water, where a municipality must take additional steps to educate the public and replace lead service lines, is 15 ppb in 10% of samples. The study found that 9% of household tests in Chicago had lead levels that exceeded 15 ppb, according to the news release from Johns Hopkins.Lead gets into water when pipes, faucets, and fixtures that contain lead corrode and leech lead into the water, according to the EPA. Lead pipes were often used to connect homes to the water main before they were banned in 1986.There is no safe level of lead for children, according to the US Consumer Product and Safety Commission. “Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect learning, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.Lead “bio-accumulates” in the body, which means it stays and builds up over time, so ongoing exposure, even at extremely low levels, can become toxic. Children, especially infants, are particularly vulnerable because a smaller dose of lead can have a larger health effect on them compared with adults, according to the EPA.“A dose of lead that would have little effect on an adult can have a significant effect on a child. In children, low levels of exposure have been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous system, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and impaired formation and function of blood cells,” the EPA states on its website.Sources of lead exposure can include lead-based paint and products, lead in the soil and air, and lead in drinking water, according to the CDC. Between 10% and 20% of our exposure to lead comes from contaminated water, according to experts.Many cities still use lead water pipes that were installed prior to the EPA’s b﻿an – across the US, more than 9.2 million households get water through lead pipes, the agency says. Chicago has nearly 400,000 lead service pipes, more than any other US city, according to the study.The EPA has proposed a requirement to replace most lead water pipes within 10 years. Chicago would get 40 years to comply with this proposal given the extraordinary number of lead water pipes in the city, Huynh said.Hanna-Attisha said that the Flint water crisis and ongoing advocacy has led to the recognition that lead-contaminated drinking water is a serious problem, but stronger policy is still needed. In February, the Biden administration announced $5.8 billion in funding to help replace lead pipes and improve water infrastructure across the country.Huynh said while municipalities work to replace lead pipes, they should also implement interim measures to expand access to lead testing and provide filtration to everyone with a lead service line.Many experts suggest that parents get their child’s lead level tested at ages 1 and 2, and possibly more often, depending on the area of the country. The test is easily done by a pediatrician, or at a local state, county or city department of health.Lead cannot be seen, tasted, or smelled so testing is the only way to know the quantities of lead in drinking water. People can reduce lead in drinking water by testing their water, contacting their water supplier to determine if their service lines are made of lead, and using and maintaining a proper filter, according to the EPA.CNN’s Madeline Holcombe and Sandee LaMotte contributed to this report."

        "title": "Blood pressure is best lowered by 2 exercises, study finds",
        "category": "health",
        "text": "When it comes to lowering blood pressure, studies have typically shown that aerobic or cardio exercises are best.Recent research suggests another type of physical activity is worth including as an effective tool to prevent and treat hypertension, or high blood pressure.Exercises that engage muscles without movement — such as wall squats and planks — may be best for lowering blood pressure, according to a large study published July 2023 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.This type of training is known as isometric, or static, exercise, according to the Mayo Clinic. Isometric muscle action happens when muscles contract but do not visibly change length, and the joints involved don’t move, facilitating stability of the body.Isometric exercises can be done with weights or without, just relying on the body’s own weight.“Overall, isometric exercise training is the most effective mode in reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure,” said study coauthor Dr. Jamie O’Driscoll in a news release. He is a reader in cardiovascular physiology at Canterbury Christ Church University’s School of Psychology and Life Sciences in England.“These findings provide a comprehensive data-driven framework to support the development of new exercise guideline recommendations for the prevention and treatment of arterial hypertension.”Existing guidelines on exercise for blood pressure management — which emphasize aerobic or cardio exercises such as running or cycling — are effective but also based on old research that excludes more recently adopted exercise protocols such as high-intensity interval training and isometric training, the authors said.The researchers felt the guidelines were outdated and in need of review, so they looked into randomized controlled trials that had reported the effects of exercise interventions, lasting two or more weeks, on systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure between 1990 and February 2023.Systolic blood pressure measures the maximum pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts and relaxes, while diastolic blood pressure denotes what the arterial pressure is when the heart rests between beats, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The authors defined healthy resting blood pressure as a reading below 130 over 85 millimeters of mercury — a measurement of pressure known as mmHg — pre-high blood pressure as ranging from 130/85 mmHg to 139/89 mmHG, and high blood pressure as 140/90 mmHG or greater. The top numbers of these figures are the systolic pressure; the bottom numbers are diastolic pressure.From a review of 270 trials with 15,827 participants — which is known as a meta-analysis — the authors found that among HIIT, isometric exercise, aerobic exercise, dynamic resistance training and a combination of the latter two, isometric exercise led to the greatest reductions in blood pressure.“The reductions in blood pressure after aerobic exercise training amounted to 4.49/2.53 mmHg; 4.55/3.04 mmHg after dynamic resistance training; 6.04/2.54 mmHg after combined training; 4.08/2.50 mmHg after HIIT; and 8.24/4 mmHg after isometric exercise training,” according to a news release.Performing wall squats (isometric exercise) was most effective for reducing systolic pressure, and running (aerobic exercise) was most beneficial for decreasing diastolic pressure, but isometric exercise overall was best for lowering both pressure elements.“It’s encouraging to see other forms of exercise explored in this research as we know that those who take on exercise they enjoy tend to carry on for longer, which is key in maintaining lower blood pressure,” said Joanne Whitmore, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, via email. Whitmore wasn’t involved in the study.“However, it’s important to note that there are other lifestyle changes as well as exercise that can benefit your blood pressure,” she added. “These include keeping to a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, cutting down on salt, not drinking too much alcohol and ensuring that you continue to take any prescribed medication.”More research is needed to determine exactly why isometric exercises might be better for lowering blood pressure than other types of training, the authors said.The authors said their findings should inform future guidelines about exercise for blood pressure.Guidelines by the World Health Organization say people should do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise weekly, which includes two strength-based training sessions.“This research fits very nicely into those guidelines,” said Jim Pate, senior exercise physiologist at Marylebone Health Group in London, who wasn’t involved in the study.QUIZ: Does your workout routine match your goals?You can do a wall squat or sit by standing with your back flat against a wall, then walking your feet about 1½ feet (0.5 meter) out from the wall, with your feet shoulder-width apart, according to the Arthritis Foundation. With your back flat against the wall and your abs tight, inhale and then exhale as you squat as low as you can comfortably go without your butt going lower than your knees. Remain squatting until you feel pain, then inhale as you stand, pushing up from your heels. The Arthritis Foundation recommends doing 10 wall squats three times weekly.Isometric training programs usually involve four two-minute contractions, separated by one- to four-minute rest intervals, done three times per week, according to the study.If you have a heart condition, talk with your doctor about the best exercise for you, Whitmore said.“People with health conditions should not be afraid to exercise in safe ways,” Pate said via email. “But seeking a professional who has experience with clinical exercise, like a sport and exercise medicine doctor, physiotherapist or clinical exercise physiologist, can help provide the structure and reassurance to make it achievable.”"

        "title": "‘Immaculate’ isn’t bad, but Sydney Sweeney shouldn’t make it a habit",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Give Sydney Sweeney credit for a highly eclectic run of movie roles, from the fact-based HBO drama “Reality” to the hit rom-com “Anyone But You” to the blink-and-you-missed-it superhero dud “Madame Web.” Add to that playing a nun in “Immaculate,” a low-budget horror movie that’s odd, creepy and occasionally campy, owing a visual debt to “The Nun” franchise and a tonal one to what the genre produced in the 1960s.Horror often serves as a means of exploring real-world issues, and underneath the jump scares and generous helpings of blood, “Immaculate” fritters around questions of women’s rights and patriarchal policies that have prompted women to dress up like characters from “The Handmaid’s Tale” as a form of protest.Granted, that’s a lot of baggage to affix to a movie that spends a little less than 90 minutes showcasing Sweeney – who at this point seems to trend daily on social media – and unnerving opening-weekend audiences, in roughly that order.The film also briefly features Simona Tabasco (her involvement in promoting the movie feels a tad misleading), who, like Sweeney, appeared in a season of “The White Lotus,” although any resemblance between the Italy of that show and the one displayed here is strictly an accident of geography.Like “The Nun,” “Immaculate” brings the rituals of Catholicism together with horror. Sweeney (who also produced the film) stars as Cecilia, a young American who is selected to work at a convent that serves as a convalescent home for aging nuns.Still working on improving her Italian, Cecilia seemingly finds a friend in Father Sal (Álvaro Morte), especially with her story of having survived a near-death experience as a child.It doesn’t take long, though, for strange things to begin happening, not quite of the flee-into-the-countryside variety, but that’s always the balancing act in building these scenarios.As the title would suggest, a foundational religious concept figures prominently in the plot, and as Cecilia’s situation becomes increasingly dire, her plight feels magnified by her status as a stranger in a remote corner of an unfamiliar land.Sweeney ably carries the film on that level, though there are beats courtesy of director Michael Mohan and screenwriter Andrew Lobel as likely to elicit uncomfortable chuckles from the audience as fear.The sole acknowledgement of Sweeney’s glamorous profile as she has loaded up on movie roles in addition to “Euphoria” comes near the outset, when a customs official laments to his buddy in Italian, so she doesn’t understand, that Cecilia becoming a nun is “a waste.”In terms of adding another layer to Sweeney’s resume, “Immaculate,” at least for what it tries to accomplish, doesn’t qualify as a waste of time, but nor is it likely to possess much of a shelf life. Basically, it’s the kind of small movie that gets made once an actor’s services are very much in demand, though Sweeney probably shouldn’t let that impulse become a habit.“Immaculate” premieres March 22 in US theaters. It’s rated R."

        "title": "‘Road House’ bounces along on a wave of nostalgia in updating a guilty pleasure",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "The original “Road House” has long been the guiltiest of pleasures, a movie that seems to be in a perpetual loop on cable, with Patrick Swayze as the philosopher-bouncer immortalizing lines like “Pain don’t hurt.” A 35-years-later update brings some of that allure to Amazon, with Jake Gyllenhaal as the reluctant warrior toting a bit more baggage, in a film that’s equal parts entertaining, silly and wildly violent (not always in that order).Among the departures, Gyllenhaal’s version of bouncer Dalton has a first name, and cleaning up bars actually isn’t his stock in trade. Passing on a layup, nobody ever actually tells him that, given his reputation, they assumed he would be bigger.Rather, the world-weary former mixed-martial-arts fighter gets recruited to the film’s central task by the new-ish owner (Jessica Williams) of a spot called The Road House in the Florida Keys, telling him that she needs help removing the seedier element so she can make a go of the place.Reluctant at first, circumstances prod Dalton to take the gig, quickly demonstrating why he’s someone with whom you should not want to mess.“Before we start, do you have insurance?” he asks a gang of motorcycle-riding hooligans before effortlessly dispatching them, which vaguely calls to mind the elevator sequence in “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.”Alas, “Road House” probably peaks there, before incorporating elements from the earlier movie like the conveniently attractive emergency-room doctor (“The Suicide Squad’s” Daniela Melchior) to whom Dalton sends a lot of business, and the stock bad guy (Billy Magnussen) determined to chase away The Road House’s owner in order to take control of the property.There’s also a muscle-for-hire type enlisted to deal with Dalton when the task proves too much for the local talent, here played by UFC champion Conor McGregor, who exhibits a swaggering physical presence offset by the fact that even when snarling out basic tough-guy dialogue, his acting represents a work in progress.Director Doug Liman’s credits include “The Bourne Identity” with Matt Damon, and he brings some of that kinetic style to the fight sequences here, which are fast and brutal. Having toned up for the gig, Gyllenhaal brings an extra dose of smart-alecky-ness to this incarnation, but his dark secret, and desire to shackle his vengeful side, feels especially trite, not that it really matters in terms of the job at hand.By that measure, this “Road House” mirrors the basic appeal of the original without quite matching it, which, with the nostalgia factor, should have given the movie a shot, like Dalton, of punching above its weight class at the box office. For that reason, Liman’s public disappointment about the decision to send the movie directly to Amazon’s Prime Video – including an oped piece for Deadline – feels justified, to the extent that choice likely left some money on the table.Like the 1989 movie, “Road House” grows more ridiculous toward the end, when Dalton has to go beyond just the bar and clean up the whole lawless town. Then again, at least the picturesque setting allows for a more scenic climax than just breaking into the villain’s house.The challenge with any reboot invariably involves capturing what people liked about its inspiration while bringing fresh wrinkles to it. On that level “Road House” moderately works – specifically, for the intended audience – with the disclaimer that trying to look bigger and being bigger aren’t necessarily one and the same.“Road House” premieres March 21 on Amazon’s Prime Video. It’s rated R."

        "title": "Kate Winslet’s golden streak of HBO miniseries fizzles with the satirical ‘The Regime’",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "After her Emmy-winning roles in “Mildred Pierce” and “Mare of Easttown,” HBO would probably say “yes” to a series in which Kate Winslet reads the phone book. Alas, they’ve come a little too close to that with “The Regime,” a political satire that’s weird but not very good, other than savoring Winslet’s over-the-top antics as an autocratic leader.Political satire can be hard work, and this creation from writer Will Tracy (whose credits include “The Menu” and “Succession”), working with directors Stephen Frears and Jessica Hobbs (whose regal credentials include “The Queen” and “The Crown,” respectively), too often goes for the broad and below the belt, which makes it feel less savvy than it clearly aspires to be.Paranoid and mercurial, Winslet’s Chancellor Elena Vernham heads a fictional country in Central Europe, whose possession of cobalt mines forces representatives of bigger nations – including a US senator (Martha Plimpton) – to take an interest in its stability and future.When the story begins, Vernham is already engaging in odd behavior that leaves her ministers (who assemble in “Dr. Strangelove”-esque meeting rooms) exchanging pained expressions, before she recruits a disgraced soldier, Herbert Zubak (Matthias Schoenaerts, seen in “Amsterdam” and “Red Sparrow”), as her confidant and near-constant companion. Confused at first, Herbert gradually occupies an increasingly significant role in affairs of state, which only makes Vernham’s stewardship, and her grip on her exalted position, more tenuous.Like everything else in this six-episode series, the Elena-Herbert relationship is decidedly strange, confounding her aide (Andrea Riseborough) and husband (Guillaume Gallienne). As for the ministers, eager to protect their phony-baloney jobs, they privately express hope she’ll simply become bored with this latest plaything, implying that Herbert isn’t the first stray the chancellor has brought into her orbit.While there’s a seemingly fertile idea in watching how an autocracy crumbles from within and without, as unchecked power breeds a kind of insanity, the more cerebral aspects largely get lost in the show’s eccentricities, overwhelming any sense of nuance.Isolated from her people in a garish palace, there’s some logic in Elena seeking out someone like Herbert as an anchor, but his quirks merely add to the lunacy, clouding who’s really manipulating whom. Even what amounts to an extended cameo by Hugh Grant as an imprisoned rival can’t do much to class up the joint.Lustily sneering her dialogue in an exaggerated accent, Winslet throws her all into the character, but to what end? Forced to exit the palace, the delusional leader finds herself needing help at one point, saying naively, “No one could refuse my face.”HBO, understandably, would have found it difficult saying “no” to a limited series with the deservedly decorated star at its center. But after watching “The Regime,” consider this an offer they probably should have refused.“The Regime” premieres March 3 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery."

        "text": "Gwyneth Paltrow appeared on Thursday’s episode of hot wing interview show “Hot Ones,” and naturally, her reaction to consuming the spicy wings was flawless.The Oscar-winner and Goop founder admitted before she even took her first bite that she was already “full of regret” about participating in this interview concept, saying she likes a little spice in her food but that she didn’t feel “equipped” to be there.She would quickly prove viewers, and herself, wrong.Paltrow hardly even broke a sweat while discussing a wide range of topics while ingesting progressively spicier bites of wings, keeping her signature dewy glow fully intact.Instead, she verbalized her internal struggle, jokingly telling the show’s host Sean Evans that she was losing his trust and that her “breathing is sort of an issue but I’m sure that’ll pass.”Staying mostly physically composed around the halfway point, some of Paltrow’s answers to Evans’ questions did become a bit unhinged – like when he asked if it’s true that former President Bill Clinton fell asleep during a White House screening of her 1996 film “Emma.”“He was snoring right in front of me. I was like, wow. I guess this is going to be a real hit movie,” she said, laughing. “But it was (a hit), so… f— you Bill Clinton!”And when she bit into the wing fully sauced with the notoriously destructive, taste bud-ruining hot sauce appropriately branded as “Da Bomb,” she simply meditated her way through the sensation she described as “incredibly painful.”“Wow,” the lifestyle mogul said, in her zen state. “The violation is intense.”Namaste, Gwyneth."

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "On the plus side, “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” doesn’t have to play coy about the inclusion of original cast members 40 years later, after having sought to keep that a surprise with 2021’s “Afterlife.” Yet having them around creates a very busy movie that lacks the emotional hook of its predecessor, while spending too much time on the wrong characters in a way that yields a rather lifeless, chilly affair.If the first film focused on the daughter (Carrie Coon) and grandkids (Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace) of the late Egon Spengler accepting his ghostbusting legacy – and the former’s new beau in the form of Gary (Paul Rudd) – the second bogs down in teen issues and new supporting players, without giving its senior class much to do.Indeed, Bill Murray always served as the beating comedic heart of the 1980s editions, and while he’s answered the call (seemingly without much enthusiasm), his screen time proves woefully brief.The whole movie, in fact, has a slightly scattered feel, taking too long to establish the nature of the latest supernatural threat and devoting its biggest source of tension to the brilliant 15-year-old Phoebe (Grace) feeling underappreciated, in a petulant-teen sort of way, as well as adjusting to her mom and Gary’s nebulous relationship.Said threat involves an artifact that holds the key to unleashing a destructive being capable of freezing the world. The item was inherited by Nadeem (Kumail Nanjiani), who just wants to cash in on his grandmother’s collection but reluctantly gets drawn into the plot.After the connection of having Jason Reitman direct the last film – picking up the baton from his father, Ivan Reitman – Gil Kenan slides into the director’s chair this go-round, again sharing credit with Reitman on the script. (The film carries a dedication to Ivan, who died in 2022.)Despite an abundance of callbacks to the original – and the participation of Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and William Atherton – “Frozen Empire” proves too mechanical to consistently deliver as a source of nostalgia. Similarly, the origins of the Spenglers – and using that as a means of paying tribute to the late Harold Ramis – simply worked better than where the family currently stands, collectively and individually.Granted, the cast is too talented not to conjure a few amusing moments, but it’s hard to escape the sense of a movie that’s sleepwalking through the old neighborhood as opposed to playfully strolling down memory lane.For all that, it’s unlikely we’ve seen the last of the “Ghostbusters,” but “Frozen Empire” at best feels like a lightly warmed-over version of the concept.“Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” premieres March 22 in US theaters. It’s rated PG-13."

        "text": "War is coming.The second season of HBO’s “House of the Dragon” begins June 16 and not one – but two – trailers were released on Thursday.“Westeros is on the brink of a bloody civil war with the Green and Black Councils fighting for King Aegon and Queen Rhaenyra, respectively,” according to an HBO announcement.“As each side believes theirs to be the rightful seat on the Iron Throne, the Green and Black trailers reflect those two perspectives in separate yet complementary halves of the same story,” the press release states. “For global audiences, “All Must Choose” their side of House Targaryen as the realm fractures in season two.”In the “Official Black Trailer,” Queen Rhaenyra (played by Emma D’Arcy) is ready for a battle in order to claim her “rightful” place on the Iron Throne.“I mean to fight this war and win it,” she tells Prince Daemon (Matt Smith).For the “Green Trailer,” Alicent (Olivia Cooke) must reckon with the fact that violence may be the only way to keep Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) on the throne.“Only weeks ago, my lord husband was alive and the realm was at peace,” she says.But no more.Based on George R.R. Martin’s “Fire & Blood,” “House of the Dragon” tells the story of House Targaryen and is set 200 years before the events of “Game of Thrones.”Based on the trailers, it’s clear that the Targaryen’s civil war, also known as the Dance of the Dragons, is set to be bloody good.“House of the Dragon” showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal talked to EW about the first ever dueling trailers and the new season picking up right after Rhaenyra’s half-brother Aegon being crowned king despite her being the chosen successor for their late father Viserys (Paddy Considine).Condal said, “This is not a story of goodies and baddies, black hats and white hats.”“It’s a story of this family that’s been rent open by this dispute over who is meant to wear the crown after Viserys passes. Some people think it’s Rhaenyra, some people think it’s Aegon, and then there are other people within who think, ‘Why should it be one of the two of them?,’” he said. “Maybe it should be somebody else. Maybe it should be me!’ The fun of this Greek tragedy is seeing, when you introduce a power vacuum to a world like this, how all of these individuals react.”“House of the Dragon” Season 2 debuts on June 16 on HBO, which like CNN is part of Warner Bros. Discovery."

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Haunting first-look images of Bill Skarsgård and FKA Twigs in the upcoming remake of the 1994 noir thriller “The Crow” were released on Wednesday, bringing renewed focus and honor to the classic’s original star, the late Brandon Lee.“Brandon was an original voice and I think he will always be synonymous with The Crow,” director of this year’s “Crow” remake Rupert Sanders said in an interview with Vanity Fair on Wednesday. “I hope he’s proud of what we’ve done and how we’ve brought the story back again.”Lee, the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, originated the role of the vengeful Eric Draven in “The Crow,” the Alex Proyas-directed supernatural thriller based on the comic book series by James O’Barr. In March 1993, 28-year-old Lee was accidentally shot and killed by a jammed prop gun on the film’s set.“His soul is very much alive in this film,” Sanders said of Lee this week.The first-look photos released on Wednesday showcase Skarsgård’s version of Draven, with a punk haircut and methodically-placed tattoos from head to toe. His signature black makeup is an eerie reminder of Lee’s Draven. Singer FKA Twigs is also seen in the photos, playing Draven’s love interest Shelly.While the 1994 film has become something of a cult classic, Sanders’ version of the film is a modern reimagining and veers from O’Barr’s source material. Despite the differences, the “Snow White and the Huntsman” director told Vanity Fair that his take is still a tribute to the memory of Lee.“Obviously, it was a terrible tragedy,” Sanders said of the star’s untimely death, adding that “it’s definitely something that we’ve always had in mind through the making of the film.”Describing Lee’s original take on Draven as a performance that possessed “fragility and beauty,” Sanders said he thinks that Skarsgård – known for his chilling rendition of Pennywise the Clown in the “It” remakes – “feels like he is a successor to that.”Sanders’ “Crow” follows Eric Draven (Skarsgård) and his fiancée Shelly, who are brutally murdered when Shelly’s dark past catches up with them.“Given the chance to save his true love by sacrificing himself,” an official synopsis reads, “Eric sets out to seek merciless revenge on their killers, traversing the worlds of the living and the dead to put the wrong things right.”“The Crow” is set to premiere in theaters on June 7."

        "text": "Get ready everyone because the ghost with the most is back in town.Warner Bros. Pictures released the first teaser trailer for the highly anticipated sequel “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” on Thursday, a followup to the 1988 Tim Burton classic starring Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder. (Like CNN, Warner Bros. Pictures is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)Even in the brief minute-plus clip, much of the DNA that made the first movie so captivating can be seen and felt, from Harry Belafonte’s calypso classic “Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)” being heavily featured – along with the unmistakable and unsettling deep synth chords of Danny Elfman’s soundtrack – to the locales, which include the red covered bridge where Barbara and Adam Maitland (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) met their end and the enchanted model town stowed away in the attic of their house.Ryder is seen as Lydia – complete with her wayward black bangs – along with fellow returning cast member Catherine O’Hara, reprising her fan-favorite role of Delia Deetz.The clip also reveals a glimpse at new addition to the cast Jenna Ortega, seen riding a bicycle through town much like her character’s mother did in the first film.It all leads to the grand reveal of Keaton’s dastardly demon Beetlejuice, who rises from the model town to the horror of Lydia and utters, “The juice is loose!”Starring Keaton, Ryder, Baldwin and Davis, the first “Beetlejuice” movie was a dark, funny and inventive original story that turned into a critical and bankable success, spawning cartoons as well as a recently-shuttered Broadway musical.The first film’s success was largely thanks to the cast, featuring Keaton as a fast-talking and highly inappropriate poltergeist who searches to take advantage of the “recently deceased” Maitlands as well as their former abode’s new tenants, the Deetzes.“Beetlejuice” boasts one of the best entrances of a character – Ryder’s gothic Lydia Deetz – in what was then her third-ever screen credit. The movie also put O’Hara, Emmy-winning star of “Schitt’s Creek,” firmly on the map in the delicious role of Lydia’s stepmother Delia.Speculation about a potential sequel had been swirling for years, with CNN last reporting in 2016 that Ryder thought “it would be great if it happened, if it was the right circumstances.” Both Burton and Keaton also hinted a sequel was possible as early as 2013.According to a description from Warner Bros., the sequel’s cast includes Monica Bellucci, Justin Theroux, “House of the Dragon” star Arthur Conti and Willem Dafoe.“Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” – a nod to how the title character’s name should never be said three times – will creep into theaters on September 6."

        "text": "Regina King’s spot-on performance as Shirley Chisholm outshines the movie devoted to the political trailblazer in “Shirley,” a laser-focused look at the first Black congresswoman’s 1972 presidential campaign that might have benefited from more biographical detail and less obsessing about amassing delegates.Providing only a hasty introduction, writer-director John Ridley (whose recent credits include “Five Days at Memorial”) launches directly into Chisholm’s longshot bid for the White House, repeatedly heeding her own instincts that drove some of her advisers (played, mainly, by the late Lance Reddick, Brian Stokes Mitchell and Terrence Howard) crazy.Specifically, Chisholm provides detailed responses on hot-button issues like school bussing and abortion, in a way that, even in the pre-Internet era, are too nuanced, she’s told, creating the risk of alienating constituencies she needs to win over.Mastering Chisholm’s distinct speech pattern, King’s portrayal gradually brings out details regarding the person and not just the candidate, from her strained relationship with her sister (played by King’s real-life sister, Reina King, who produced the project with her) to Chisholm’s frequent irritation with her husband Conrad (Michael Cherrie), who articulates the toll of living in his wife’s shadow by saying, “A shadow of a man is what you want.”“Shirley” nicely presents the hurdles Chisholm had to overcome, and the rough-and-tumble of a scrappy and underfunded political operation that had to pick its spots in terms of where and how to spend money. There are also savvy exchanges that reflect lingering issues of letting candidates speak their mind as opposed to what will poll best.Still, the film has stretches that feel as if it’s bogged down in minutia, and too few moments like the one where King ignores her political counselors and chooses to visit avowed segregationist George Wallace (W. Earl Brown), her political opposite, in the hospital after the attempt on his life. The narrow devotion to the ’72 convention also skips some seemingly important details, like the fact that eventual Democratic nominee George McGovern went on to experience a crushing defeat.Bearing memorial dedications to Reddick and King’s son Ian, “Shirley” joins recent projects like Netflix’s “Rustin” and “On the Basis of Sex” (about Ruth Bader Ginsburg) in celebrating iconic figures that swam against tides of overt racism, bigotry and sexism in helping to carve out trails for those who followed.The result is a sturdy but unspectacular film, one that honors Chisholm’s place in history while representing just one, too-concentrated facet of her giant shadow.“Shirley” premieres March 22 on Netflix."

        "text": "After multiple delays in production, the new Bob Dylan biopic has started filming — which means a first look at actor Timothée Chalamet as the legendary folk singer.Costumed in an army-green jacket and a newsboy cap, Chalamet was pictured filming “A Complete Unknown,” a movie chronicling the singer-songwriter’s career beginnings, in New York this weekend, setting off a stream of both excitement and jokes among fans.“He looks like he’s going to Camp Rock,” one X user quipped, referencing a Disney movie about a musical summer camp.“This is not Bob Dylan, it’s simply every man who has ever tried to talk to me about Bob Dylan,” wrote author Marissa R. Moss.Others joked that Chalamet looked like Fievel, the animated mouse in “An American Tail.”After first being announced in 2020, production for “A Complete Unknown” experienced numerous lags, from the pandemic to the SAG-AFTRA strike. Still, the movie has retained complete support from Dylan himself, who gave director James Mangold detailed annotated notes on the script.“I’ve spent several wonderfully charming days in his company, just one-on-one, talking to him,” Mangold said last year. “He loves movies.”The movie isn’t really a Dylan biopic, Mangold has said, and is instead more focused on a moment in the singer’s life.“It’s a kind of an ensemble piece about this moment in time, the early ’60s in New York, and this 17-year-old kid with $16 in his pockets hitchhikes his way to New York to meet Woody Guthrie who is in the hospital,” Mangold said.Chalamet will be doing his own singing in the movie and has hired the same vocal and dialect coaches that worked with Austin Butler in “Elvis.”Dylan has been notoriously elusive, and his life and career have been the subject of multiple movies. One, 2007’s “I’m Not There,” directed by Todd Haynes, cast six different actors as Dylan’s multiple personas. Martin Scorsese made a concert film in 2019 called “Rolling Thunder Revue,” chronicling Dylan’s 1975 tour of the same name.“A Complete Unknown” does not yet have a release date."

        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "In the early heyday of miniseries, “Shōgun” was the show of the year in 1980, and it might be again 44 years later. FX’s updated, sumptuous version of James Clavell’s sweeping novel blends an intoxicating combination of action, romance and political intrigue, majestically spread over 10 parts that, unlike most limited series, sustain that weight and then some.Set in feudal Japan at the start of the 17th century, the story begins with a European ship that reaches a fishing village under the stewardship of English pilot John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis).With Japan already visited by Portuguese merchants and Jesuit missionaries – turning the country into Portugal’s “secret empire in the East” – the locals are wary and indeed brutal toward the “barbarian” invaders, in scenes that pushed network standards back in 1980 and that are exceeded in those visceral qualities here.“I won’t die in this wretched land,” Blackthorne says defiantly, although given how the odds are stacked against him, that sounds like a hollow pledge.Soon, though, word of the English pilot, or “Anjin,” reaches Lord Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada, recently seen in “John Wick: Chapter 4,” and simply spectacular), who is in the midst of a perilous political battle with other members of the Council of Regents. Those tensions followed the death of Japan’s ruler, leaving a power vacuum until his young son is old enough to succeed him.That chaos also creates the possibility of one regent emerging to consolidate power, and perhaps even gain the title of shōgun. Eager to find any advantage, Toranaga brings the Anjin into his circle, enlisting the lady Mariko (Anna Sawai, in a big step up from Apple’s “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters”) to serve as his translator. Harboring her own complicated past, and locked in an unhappy marriage to the suspicious samurai Buntaro (Shinnosuke Abe), Mariko and Blackthorne gradually forge a bond filled with risk for both.Richard Chamberlain earned the nickname “King of the Miniseries” thanks to “Shōgun” (after Sean Connery passed on the part) and “The Thorn Birds,” and Jarvis, while perfectly fine, can’t match that level of leading-man charisma.Yet part of that has to do with shifting the narrative balance, smartly, toward both enhancing the female roles and the Japanese characters in general, as Toranaga jockeys with his principal rival Ishido (Takehiro Hira), realizing that strategically outmaneuvering him might be the only way to survive.“Shōgun” plunges into a feudal society where life often appears cheap, and ritual suicide (or seppuku) happens with a regularity that’s not for the faint of heart – or for that matter, when it comes to the muscular and stark action sequences, the weak of stomach.Still, if the original NBC miniseries was in many ways ahead of its time, this sweeping, heavily subtitled production arrives in an age that’s far more hospitable to this kind of ambitious storytelling. The only quibble would involve some creative liberties taken with the book near the end (the author’s daughter, Michael Clavell, is among the producers), which are provocative but not necessarily an improvement.Of course, in today’s heavily fragmented streaming environment “Shōgun” won’t be the massive ratings hit that it was back when there were three broadcast networks (and not much else), but those who wade into this dense history will be amply rewarded.“All men can be broken,” Toranaga muses at one point, with a quiet sense of menace and determination.If only all limited series could be half as good as “Shōgun.”“Shōgun” premieres February 27 on Hulu and at 10 p..m. ET the same day on FX."

Wiig plays Maxine, a social climber trying to land with the right movers and shakers in Palm Beach. She also executive produces, along with Laura Dern, who calls Wiig the “perfect Maxine” and the only person they had in mind for the role.“From getting a call from Laura Dern to reading the scripts and meeting everyone involved, it was really just, yes, across the board,” Wigg told CNN in a recent interview about the project. “I’ve never played a character like Maxine before and it honestly was just a gut feeling. You just kind of know in those cases whether it’s gonna be like a yes or a no. And this was just a very, very strong yes.”Her costar Josh Lucas, who plays opposite Wiig as her pilot husband Douglas, called working on the series with the “Saturday Night Live” alumna a “dream.”“We can’t overstate it,” Lucas told CNN. “Everything from the costume design, the sumptuous, extraordinary production design, and everything filled us with this reality of this world that is fictional in a way, but is completely based in this real world of what the late 1960s uber wealth, Palm Beach, mixed with the historical time that’s going on, all of it.”A blend of humor, satire and mystery, “Palm Royale” also features Carol Burnett, Bruce Dern, Allison Janney, Amber Chardae Robinson, Julia Duffy, Leslie Bibb, Kaia Gerber, Mindy Cohn and Ricky Martin.Martin plays Robert in the series, a man who works at the exclusive beach club and initially doesn’t trust Maxine. He says working with Wiig was inspiring.“It was wonderful to walk into the makeup room every day and just read lines with her. That set would set the tone for the rest of the day,” Martin said. “I’m very thankful because she’s just so generous. Even in moments where I felt nervous, she was there, her presence was very comforting. And I will always be very thankful for that.”“Palm Royale” premieres March 20 on Apple TV+."

        "title": "‘X-Men ’97’ delivers an animated blast from the past – and maybe Marvel’s future",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "“X-Men ‘97” at first seems like narrowly pitched made-for-streaming fare, reviving a cultish animated Saturday-morning series launched more than 30 years ago, basically picking up where that show left off.Look a little closer, though, and “X-Men” could offer clues, and signposts, as Marvel pivots into a next phase that hinges on incorporating that popular property and Fantastic Four, two staples of Marvel Comics that have returned to its cinematic fold after decades under the stewardship of 20th Century Fox.Marvel parent Disney’s 2019 acquisition of key Fox entertainment assets, including the rights to X-Men and Fantastic Four, has fueled excitement about where those titles will go as they’re incorporated into Marvel’s interlocking universe. That’s perhaps especially true of the latter, after two stabs at “Fantastic Four” movies that generally underwhelmed fans.How does “X-Men ‘97” fit into that? Because the original series, which ran for five seasons starting in 1992, accomplished two things that seem vital to invigorating Marvel’s lineup, from Disney+ series to theatrical blockbusters: embracing the comics in a way that satisfies hardcore fans while still appealing to more casual consumers; and attracting adults while playing well with kids, without stooping to reach them.The animated “X-Men” series pulled off that delicate high-wire act, notably, eight years before the movies began with Hugh Jackman’s breakout role as Wolverine, with another eight passing before “Iron Man” launched Marvel’s “cinematic universe.”Despite playing on Saturday mornings – a window predicated, in terms of advertising, on ratings among children under 12 – the show shocked executives by attracting plenty of teenagers and young men, who, after years of disappointing comic-book adaptations, embraced one they could enjoy for its ambitious storytelling and fidelity to the comics.As Eric Lewald, the head writer on the original series, wrote in his book “Previously on X-Men: The Making of an Animated Series,” back in 1992, “almost nobody in Hollywood believed that an X-Men TV series could possibly work.”Fortunately, one of the people who did was Margaret Loesch, a former head of Marvel Productions, who had left to launch the Fox Children’s Network and persuaded her bosses to take a chance on the show.The result was a series that captured X-Men’s central metaphor – students at Charles Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, who, as mutants, face extra pangs of teen alienation and feeling different – with the audacity to translate the comics without cute robots or forms of pandering frequently found in earlier shows.Taking advantage of the streaming format and passage of time, “X-Men ‘97” is a little more adult in tone than the original, though it remains true to its spirit and incorporates plenty of familiar trappings, from the animation style to the memorable musical theme.The bigger picture, of course, involves Marvel’s rough stretch at the box office – along with rival DC and others – amid the malaise stemming from the rise of streaming, an associated glut of Marvel series and the shift toward at-home viewing due to Covid. After an enviable run of hits, the suddenness of that has shaken theaters and studios, while leaving Disney in self-reflection mode trying to get Marvel back on track.“X-Men ‘97” will play on a smaller screen, but its unexpected, demographic-straddling success in the ‘90s still seems relevant to the challenge Marvel must master to rekindle its magic. Nor will that involve a one-size-fits-all approach, as enthusiasm around the upcoming “Deadpool & Wolverine” would suggest.In keeping with a theme from the comics, the question is what comes after a mutation, and in this case, whether it can set Marvel on a path to the next phase in its evolution.“X-Men ‘97” premieres March 20 on Disney+."

        "text": "What began as a discussion about obesity ended with viewers learning something new about Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King’s friendship.The women appeared Wednesday night on CNN’s “King Charles,” hosted by King and Charles Barkley, to talk about weight loss and weight management medication.Barkley thanked Winfrey for her recent special, “An Oprah Special: Shame, Blame and the Weight Loss Revolution,” which explored the topic in depth.The former professional basketball player turned commentator shared that he’s dropped a significant amount of weight with the help of medication.Winfrey likened the struggle some people have with obesity to those who have a propensity to alcoholism in terms of how bodies are predisposed to respond differently. She noted how the issue of alcoholism was discussed years ago on her popular daytime talk show.“In that late ’80s, early 90s, we were doing a lot of shows about alcoholism and people were saying then the same thing they’re saying now, ‘just put the food down.’” Winfrey said. “They were saying ‘just put the bottle down’ because nobody understood that for some people - not everybody who drinks, over drinks becomes an alcoholic, but if you carry the marker or the gene that allows alcoholism to flourish with you, you then develop alcoholism.”She then noted to King, “I can drink you under the table” and not become an alcoholic to which King responded, “She’s not lying.”That’s when talk turned to a different kind of shot, unrelated to the way most prescription weight loss medication is administered.“Tequila shots, anyone?” King joked, causing Winfrey to say, “I can out tequila almost anyone!”Now there’s something we’d like to see!“Oprah, I just want to say you know I already love you,” Barkley declared, “I love you more because we can go out and drink tequila anytime.”He then revealed that whenever he goes out with King, she doesn’t drink.Winfrey then spilled some tea - or milk - on King’s cocktails of choice.“Listen, last big party we were at, I swear she asked for a Shirley Temple [a non-alcoholic mixed drink] and be sure to put a cherry in that,” Winfrey said. “We were at Tina Turner’s wedding and she asked for milk!”King tried to get things back on track as Barkley cracked up, explaining that she simply enjoys a glass of milk with her cake."

You’re like, oh, wait a minute,” he said laughing.Cheadle added that even attending award shows as an audience member includes some stress.“For me personally, it’s hard because when you’re at the Oscars, you are the show,” he said “If you’re in the audience, those cameras are on.

It’s been a lot of fun.”In between production, Cheadle also managed to film a sleek new commercial for PopCorners, joining fellow “Oceans” franchise castmates George Clooney and Brad Pitt to have starred in ad campaigns.“Well, they backed the truck up,” Cheadle joked about his decision to do the spot, though said he actually enjoys the snack.“It’s a great alternative to fried snacks,” he said.The commercial is set in a speakeasy, filled with partygoers and a band.“It was just fun working with the creative team and collaborating on the concept,” Cheadle said. “That is really the bar for these kinds of things.”A good rule of thumb for a lot of life, he added.“If you’re going to be like, why did I do that, then that’s not fun,” he said.Healthy snacks are fun. Award shows, not so much. Noted, Don."

        "title": "Hollywood’s first Asian American movie star has long been misunderstood. A new book seeks to change that",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "About two decades ago, Katie Gee Salisbury glimpsed a photo that would stay with her for years to come.The black-and-white image depicted a sea of parade-goers surrounding a convertible. In the back seat was a Chinese American woman looking ever so chic and glamorous.Salisbury, a fifth generation Chinese American with deep roots in Los Angeles’ Chinatown, was immediately captivated by the woman. It was her first day as an intern at LA’s Chinese American Museum, and a curator explained that she was looking at Anna May Wong: an internationally famous actress from the ’20s and ‘30s who is considered Hollywood’s first Asian American movie star.“I wanted to know more about who this woman was,” Salisbury says. “I couldn’t believe no one ever told me about her.”That photo ultimately inspired Salisbury’s new book, “Not Your China Doll: The Wild and Shimmering Life of Anna May Wong,” which published on March 12.As Salisbury readily admits, she’s not the first person to chronicle Wong’s life and career. But she felt that other biographies of the actress, though notable contributions to the study of Wong’s life, left something to be desired.“A lot of them are written by academics or by men, and I always personally felt that they were missing the perspective of an Asian American woman,” she adds.Previous biographers largely painted Wong as a tragic figure, according to Salisbury, overemphasizing rumors about her sexuality, her struggles with alcoholism and her decision to never marry.In “Not Your China Doll,” Salisbury set out to tell a different story.It’s true that Wong’s life was not without challenges — because of Hollywood’s racism, she was too often relegated to stereotypical, side parts and lost countless roles to White actors in yellowface.But as Salisbury points out, she had plenty of triumphs, too. Her title role in “The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong” marked TV’s first Asian American lead. The trailblazing star also captured the hearts of audiences and critics, and ultimately forged her own path in an otherwise prejudiced industry.Salisbury spoke with CNN about how Wong defied stereotypes of Asian women, how Hollywood has changed since Wong’s time and about how her own Asian American identity shaped the book.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.You write in the preface that in addition to consulting primary sources and Wong’s niece, you also drew upon your “own personal and familial knowledge of what it’s like being Asian American in this country.” How did your identity shape how you told Wong’s story?I have a somewhat unique position. On the one hand, my Chinese American family has been in this country for five generations. We immigrated from the same place in southern China as Anna May Wong’s family, so there was definitely a kinship there just in the family history.I myself am mixed. I’m half Chinese and half Anglo Irish. I grew up in a very Asian community. But at the same time, people don’t always recognize me as Asian, so I don’t necessarily have the exact same experience that Anna May Wong and a lot of Asian American women have.What I really tried to do was just embody what I thought was Anna May Wong’s experience by just tapping into my own experiences and the experiences of my friends and family that have been shared with me. I put myself in her shoes when certain things happened to her.A good example I talked about in the book is when she was making “The Thief of Bagdad.” It was reported by Douglas Fairbanks — the star of the film and the producer — that there was an incident in which Anna May Wong wouldn’t put on the “Mongol slave” costume.The reason Fairbanks cites (for Wong apparently being difficult on set) is that the publicity guy got her Chinese name wrong — instead of “two yellow willows,” he said “two yellow widows.” The story to me just rang kind of phony, because I can’t imagine someone would get mad about something that sounds so silly.So not knowing what happened, I’m trying to think if I was Anna May Wong and I was 18 years old at the time, this is her big break. Douglas Fairbanks is one of the most famous people in Hollywood and the world. Everyone knew his film was going to be a huge blockbuster, and she had a very prominent role in it. So what would make her step away from the set and refuse to put her costume on?It had to be something pretty serious. To me, knowing her attitude already at that age towards the racism that she experienced, she was prepared to fight back. She wasn’t going to let people denigrate her in that way. So using circumstantial evidence, but also just understanding her position in that situation, my working theory is that someone made a racist comment to her, and she was like, “Well, I’m not gonna settle for this type of behavior, even in the most important film of my career.”That’s an example of how I tried to embody what her perspective might have been.What’s the meaning behind the book’s title “Not Your China Doll”?When I started thinking about this book, I wanted to reframe the narrative around her life.So much of it is focused on the fact that she had to play stereotypes and the disappointment of not getting the lead role in “The Good Earth,” which would have potentially changed her career and her legacy in some people’s eyes. (Note: A White actor was cast as Chinese farmer Wang Lung, so Wong was ultimately passed over for the role of his wife O-Lan in favor of a White actress because of rules that outlawed the portrayal of interracial romance on screen.)Also the fact that her later years were really difficult. She struggled with alcoholism. She struggled with the fact that she couldn’t play the same types of roles she did when she was young. The way that (her story) gets told makes her life sound like a tragedy and that she had no control over it.From my perspective, she had so much agency. She exerted so much resiliency and control over her future. There’s a lot to what she did that has a certain defiance and righteousness to it.“Not Your China Doll,” because she is always called the China doll, just felt appropriate. It’s not only a phrase that applies to Anna May Wong, but a lot of Asian American women feel that they’ve been objectified and exoticized in the same way.Was there anything you learned about Wong during your research that surprised you?The thing that really impresses me still today is just how confident she was in herself and in her belief that she deserved more. She was always willing to fight for that. She did so in a very diplomatic and shrewd way — she didn’t outright complain, but she found other avenues to the thing that she wanted.Her decision to go to Europe in 1928 was a very difficult decision to make. To leave Hollywood was a really scary thing, because most people who did that didn’t come back in a successful way. She was only 23 at the time, and she says herself in one of her memoir pieces that many people told her not to do it. But then she says, “I just made up my mind that I would go.”I just love that confidence and that determination that whatever happened, she was going to make it work because she believed in herself. And honestly, if she hadn’t gone to Europe, I’m not sure that we would be talking about her today. That move really made her career.One striking facet of Wong’s story is how everyone around her seemed to recognize her talent and star power, but she could never achieve her true potential because of how deeply racist Hollywood and the US overall were at the time. How did the country’s racial politics affect her career?It’s hard for us to imagine how limited certain people were in how they could move through society. There’s a story that I just recently found where she was walking into a movie premiere and someone called her a “Chink” and said “Go back to where you came from” or “go back to the laundry.” But at the same time, because she was seen as a little bit more of an oddity, people were a little bit less in her face. She had much more mobility than she would if she had been a Black woman.There were also plenty of people who loved Anna May Wong and wanted to see more of her. It’s a very complex situation for movie studios then because they’re trying to tow a certain line. In the late 1920s, they had all these scandals, and they’re trying to clean things up and seem more appropriate. Part of that is limiting the types of roles that Anna May Wong can have.But at the same time, in the 1930s, there’s the Hays Code (a set of self-imposed guidelines on major film studios that prohibited nudity, miscegenation and other content), but they made exceptions all the time in other situations. So it was a code that was applied very selectively according to their whims.I do believe that at the end of the day, if producers and studio heads had wanted to make her an A-lister they would have, but they found excuses not to.How does Wong’s legacy show up today?So many Asian and Asian American actors in Hollywood today really look up to her as a source of strength and inspiration. (The landscape for Asian American actors) has definitely changed in a really good way in the last few years, but looking at her legacy is a reminder of the fact that we’ve had to wait 100 years for this type of progress. She was there from the very beginning, so why has it taken so long?It’s not that Asian Americans weren’t there. But the institution was built in such a way that it pushed them out.Watching Michelle Yeoh win the Oscar for Best Actress last year was such an emotional moment for me and for so many people. But I like to remind people that it took 95 years to get to that point. Anna May Wong was acting before the Oscars even existed.What do you feel has changed about Hollywood since Wong’s time? What, if anything, has stayed the same?“Crazy Rich Asians” changed the game because it showed people that you could have a film that was led by an Asian cast that is commercially successful. Of course, there’s baggage that comes with that because then (studio heads) want a certain formula and they want it to always be “Crazy Rich Asians.” We want to tell a lot of different types of stories, not just ones like that.I do think that there has been a concerted effort among Asian Americans in the industry. There’s so many more people who are higher up in these organizations, whether they’re production companies or studios, who are helping to make decisions or advocating for these types of stories.The other reason really is just that there’s so much more opportunity now. You don’t have to go through Hollywood in order for your film to be successful and to reach an audience. You can fundraise, self-fund, produce it independently and hope it gets attention at a film festival.Watching “Everything Everywhere All At Once” — who would have thought that a film like that could win Best Picture at the Oscars? There’s so many more avenues now to make films and to tell stories that just weren’t available during her time.Knowing what you know about Wong, how do you think she would feel about the plethora of Asian American stories on screen today?I think she would be so happy and over the moon to see what’s going on today. I almost think it’s beyond her wildest dreams. She was the only one, and now there are so many people in the Asian American cinematic universe.Hopefully, she would be an even bigger star. It’s hard to compare just because her acting style is a little bit different from what we’re used to today. But she was also a pretty fast study, so I think she’d figure out a way to be involved.What films featuring Wong do you recommend?For her silent era, “Piccadilly” (1929) or “Pavement Butterfly (1929).“Shanghai Express” (1932) is a great one from the sound era with Marlene Dietrich. My only complaint is there’s not enough Anna May Wong in it.One other later film I would suggest would be “Daughter of Shanghai” (1937). It was a B-movie, but she had more influence over it so she was able to create a storyline where the Asian actors are the heroes and heroines and all the bad guys are played by White actors. And she gets a happy ending.What do you hope readers take away from Wong’s story?I’d like for readers to appreciate all of the things that she accomplished in her career, rather than dwelling on some of the more tragic things that happened.Yes, there were a lot of things that she had to struggle through. Despite it all, she really found a way to come out on top. The fact that she was weeks away from beginning rehearsals in “Flower Drum Song” (Note: Wong was originally cast as Madame Liang in the film adaptation of the 1958 Broadway musical but died shortly before production began), which would have been a huge milestone to have an all principal Asian cast, just tells you how far she went with her career.It’s a shame that she didn’t get to do it, but that doesn’t take away from the power of what she did."

        "text": "Paul Rudd has described himself in a new interview as somebody who lives his life “like someone’s grandfather,” but he does find ways to keep things young and fresh, including listening to the music of pop superstar Taylor Swift.In an interview with MTV posted to YouTube on Thursday, Rudd said that his 14-year-old daughter loves Swift, but he made it clear that he, too, is a fan – and that his own Swiftie status is not by proxy.“I think she’s really very good, I think she’s great,” the “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” star said.He even knows a number of her songs that he sang along to during the “Eras Tour” concert he attended with his daughter in May, including “Mastermind,” “Cruel Summer” and “August.”Earlier this month, Rudd spoke about going to the “Eras Tour” concert while appearing on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” saying how “knocked out” he was by the experience.“I just thought there was so much support and love and positivity,” he said. “And to feel that kind of feeling with that many people… It was incredible and she did it all.”Rudd even swapped friendship bracelets with people at the show in May – which is something that’s become a ritual at “Eras Tour concerts – as seen in photos posted to social media by concertgoers.The “Clueless” actor is also a well-known Kansas City Chiefs fan being a native of the Missouri town, and has a lot of love for the team’s all-star tight end – who is also Swift’s boyfriend – Travis Kelce.“I’m a big fan of that team, and I have been my whole life,” he told MTV. “Travis Kelce is the greatest guy.”Looks like Chiefs Kingdom and Swiftie-ville have a true fan in Rudd."

        "title": "‘Ricky Stanicky’ gives John Cena and Zac Efron a chance to flex their comedy muscles",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Playfully letting John Cena flex his comedy muscles, “Ricky Stanicky” works from an amusing premise that owes an unlikely debt to a 51-year-old “MASH” episode, in which an imaginary character must be brought to life. Also serving as a reunion of Zac Efron and director Peter Farrelly, the execution yields an only fitfully funny R-rated comedy, a genre that’s found a receptive platform via Amazon.Like seemingly all friendship-based comedies, this one begins with a flashback, as a trio of boys get into trouble and desperately blame what happened on “Ricky Stanicky,” a made-up kid.Jump to the present day, and Dean (Efron) along with his pals JT (“Dave’s” Andrew Santino) and Wes (Jermaine Fowler) are still invoking the name – in much the way “MASH’s” Hawkeye did with “Captain Tuttle” – although here, mostly to get away for guys weekends or escape situations they’d rather avoid, such as a baby shower. Feeling smug about the ruse, they wryly toast Stanicky as “The best friend we never had.”As it happens, their latest juvenile escapade takes them to Atlantic City, where they meet an odd lounge-entertainer type who goes by the name “Rock Hard” Rod (Cena), right before the ruse blows up in their faces. Forced to produce Stanicky after using him as their excuse, Dean has the bright idea of hiring Rod to portray Stanicky at a bris for JT’s baby.Not surprisingly given the film’s below-the-belt bent, a circumcision gag follows, while Rod has to vamp his way through all the fabulous attributes the trio have ascribed to Stanicky through the years.Although Rod has dutifully studied the “bible” they’ve assembled, that sets up plenty of highly awkward moments to keep misleading both their romantic partners and Dean and JT’s boss (William H. Macy, getting into the silly spirit).After winning a much-debated Oscar with “Green Book,” Farrelly collaborated with Efron on another streaming movie, 2022’s “The Greatest Beer Run Ever.” “Ricky Stanicky” shifts closer to the sort of raunchy comedic fare for which Farrelly was known when working with brother Bobby on movies like “There’s Something About Mary.”Usually crediting a script to six writers (Farrelly being one of them) isn’t a particularly good sign – and the film does have a sitcom-writers-room feel about it – yet there are some reasonably good laughs peppered throughout, as well as a darker, more serious side about Dean’s difficult childhood that feels too incongruous with the movie’s overall tone.While edgier comedies have found the sledding fairly difficult at the box office of late (“Anyone But You” being a notable exception), Amazon has exhibited a fondness for the genre, including the recent Snoop Dogg vehicle “The Underdoggs.”Like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cena has smartly taken advantage of his tough-guy physique to carve a path into broad comedy, from the DC series “Peacemaker” to “Blockers,” “Trainwreck” and “Playing with Fire.” “Ricky Stanicky” might be imaginary and doesn’t measure up to its promise, but in terms of that basket within the wrestler-turned-actor’s filmography, it at least fits Cena like a glove.“Ricky Stanicky” premieres March 7 on Amazon’s Prime Video. It’s rated R."

        "title": "The ‘subversive spirituality’ of Bob Marley is still being overlooked",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "Dean MacNeil couldn’t eat. Couldn’t sleep. He was on emotional autopilot because something “tore a hole in the soul of my family and me.”It was the summer of 1991, and MacNeil had taken a road trip from Connecticut to Vermont with his younger brother, Scott. They hiked, jet-skied and spent much of the time listening to Scott’s favorite musician, reggae superstar Bob Marley.A couple of weeks after the trip, a phone call came at midnight. Scott had been killed in a car accident. He was a passenger in another teenager’s car when it slammed into a tree. He was on his way home from a reggae concert. MacNeil was devastated.He found refuge, though, in Marley’s music. He started listening to Marley’s songs again and discovered something: Biblical verses were scattered like gems through virtually every one of them. The lyrics weren’t just nods to the Bible but lengthy scriptural quotations that called the listener to believe that no matter what kind of “changes” and “rages” they were experiencing, they could “never be blue,” as Marley says in “Forever Loving Jah,” a nod to the Rastafarian religion’s name for God.“That accident really sent my sister, mom, dad and myself into a tailspin,” MacNeil says today. “But Bob Marley’s music is what got us through. It helped us deal with the grief and the despair by listening to these messages of hope and perseverance. I went to the classroom of Bob Marley, because my very survival depended on it.”MacNeil found new meaning in the Marley adage: “You never know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice.” He started leading Bible studies at his church and completed a master’s degree in theology. He also became a musician and author of a book, “The Bible and Bob Marley: Half the Story Has Never Been Told.”Today, as Marley’s life is celebrated in a new hit movie, MacNeil and others make a bold claim: Marley’s spiritual impact is as significant as his musical legacy. The two are, in many ways, inseparable. These Marley fans and scholars say it’s time to stop glossing over or editing out Marley’s “subversive spirituality.”“The Bible was as important to Marley’s music as his guitar,” MacNeil says. “You really need to know the Bible to understand Marley’s message.”That’s not the typical message about Marley’s legacy that his fans get today. Since Marley’s untimely death in 1981, he has been defined as a musical icon.His smiling visage adorns T-shirts, bags, key chains, scented candles, lip balm, iPhone cases and posters in college dorm rooms. His album, “Exodus,” was selected as the best album of the 20th century by Time magazine. His song, “One Love” was named the song of the century by the BBC. Some critics even say Marley was the most influential songwriter of the 20th century.This is the version of Marley that primarily appears in the current hit film, “Bob Marley: One Love.” It offers a glimpse into Marley’s life in the late ’70s, when he became a symbol of reconciliation in his home country of Jamaica.But there’s another reason why many people don’t see Marley as a religious figure. There’s a less savory aspect to his personal life that the current film only touches on: Marley was a married man who reportedly fathered at least 11 children, some of them outside of his marriage to Rita Marley.So how can a man who fathered illegitimate children and smoked marijuana be considered a holy man?The answer can be found in the way that Marley lived and died. Start with his music. His musical career began and ended with a Biblical verse.Marley would often start concerts by reciting Biblical passages, MacNeil says. His first published song, “Judge Not,” recorded when he was 17, was based on Matthew 7:1 — a passage in which Jesus warned his followers to “Judge not, that ye be not judged.”The last track on his final album was “Redemption Song” (“How long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look?”). It was based on Luke 13:34, (“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you”).“His faith was central not only to his music but to what Rastafarians would call his ‘livity,’ which is his whole lifestyle, his whole approach to life,” says Vivien Goldman, a British journalist and educator who befriended Marley while working as his publicist.Marley invented a new species of musician: the holy rocker. Other musicians like Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash sang about their faith. But none cherished the Bible like Marley. Several biographers have noted that while on tour, Marley would often withdraw to a secluded spot on his bus to ponder scripture. He would then return to the rest of his bandmates and debate — not over women or song credits — but the meaning of biblical verses.There are classic stories of musicians who were inseparable from their instruments. Jimi Hendrix supposedly slept with his guitar. Marley had the same attitude toward his Bible.Goldman says that Marley never went anywhere without his weathered King James Bible, which had a photocopied portrait of the Lion of Judah in full regalia pasted on the cover, and photos of Haile Selassie I, the former emperor of Ethiopia, on the inside cover. Rastafarians consider Selassie, who died in 1975, as the second coming of Jesus, a Black messiah.“His spiritual practice was absolutely a crucial part of his life,” says Goldman, author of “The Book of Exodus: The Making and Meaning of Bob Marley and the Wailers’ Album of the Century.”“He would make time no matter what — if he was in a busy airport, he would retreat to the side so he could sit and study his Bible.”For some, God and the Bible are symbols of oppression. Both have been used to justify slavery, homophobia and imperialism. But Marley saw God as a liberator, a deliverer from political and personal oppression.In his song “Exodus,” he sang: “Jah come to break downpression, rule equality, wipe away transgression, set the captives free.”MacNeil says it’s almost impossible to listen to any Marley song without bumping up against the Bible. He examined 83 Marley songs and identified 137 Biblical references, comprised of 39 quotations and 98 allusions.Marley’s song, “Forever Loving Jah,” is a prime example. When Marley sings, “Because only a fool lean upon his own misunderstanding,” he’s quoting a scripture from Proverbs 3. And Marley’s album “Exodus” is named after a famous book in the Bible, revered by Jews and Christians.“He’s not just quoting the Bible,” MacNeil says. “He’s actively engaged with it. He’s interpreting it. He’s making it relevant to his own experience. He’s making it relevant to a wide audience.”Marley also made something else relevant to a wider audience: the Rastafari religion. No musical figure has, arguably, done more to popularize a religion than Marley. His beliefs revolved around Rastafarianism.But in the years since Marley’s death, his religious and political beliefs have been sanded down, reduced to a fuzzy, marijuana-inspired haze call for “One love, one heart. One destiny.” Some critics call this the “Disneyfication” of Marley’s legacy.But the Rastafari religion has a much gritter and more defiant edge. It was spawned by the tremendous suffering Afro-Jamaicans experienced for centuries. The slave trade, for example, was even more lethal in Jamaica, where Marley was born, than the Deep South of the US. More than twice as many slaves were shipped to Jamaica alone than all thirteen North American colonies. Most were tortured, raped and worked to death, according to Adam Hochschild, author of “Bury the Chains,” a history of the abolition movement in the United Kingdom.“The Caribbean was a slaughterhouse,” Hochschild wrote, describing the region’s slave trade.The grinding poverty, suffering and political disenfranchisement of Afro-Jamaicans persisted under British colonial rule. Marley was born in rural Jamaica to an Afro-Jamaican teenage mom and a White father. It is impossible to understand him and the Rastafari faith, which emerged in Jamaica during the 1930s, without knowing the country’s violent history.“Rastafari is a religion of resistance that blended Afrocentrism, Judaism, and Christianity,” says Deepak Sarma, a religious studies professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio.“Though it is often categorized as a religion, it is also a revolutionary ideology to right the wrongs of British imperialism, the slave trade, and colonization of Jamaica and other Caribbean islands.”Marley saw his music as a divine calling.“God sent me on earth. He send me to do something, and nobody can stop me,” he once said. “If God want to stop me, then I stop. Man never can.”Rastafarians, though, are known primarily by many casual observers for two elements of their religion: dreadlocks and the smoking of marijuana. The dreadlocks are inspired by an Old Testament passage from Leviticus 21:5, (“They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in the flesh”). Marijuana, or “ganja,” was seen as a sacrament for Rastafarians to deepen spiritual awareness.If there is a founder of the Rastafari religion, many point to Marcus Garvey, a Black Jamaican and activist who preached Black self-reliance, self-pride and led a “Back to Africa” movement in the first half of the 20th century. Selassie is also a central figure to Rastafarians in ways that puzzle some outsiders: How can Rastas worship a Black political figure who was also seen by some as a dictator?Goldman, Marley’s former publicist, recalled asking Marley about the wisdom of worshipping Selassie. She wrote that he was stunned by her question, asking:“So, you want me to worship a white god?”If an outsider fixates on the bitterness of Marley’s quote about a White god, it’s easy to fall for the myth that Rastafarians demonize White people. But one of the reasons Marley’s spiritual beliefs still resonate is his religion didn’t go that route.Marley didn’t limit oppression to one color.“I can’t be prejudiced against myself,” he once said when someone asked him if he was prejudiced against White people.“My father was a White and my mother Black, you know. Them call me half-caste, or whatever. Well, me don’t dip on the Black man’s side nor the White man’ side. Me dip on God’s side, the one who create me and cause me to come from Black and White.”Marley didn’t just live for his beliefs. He also died, in part, because of them.In 1977, Marley visited a doctor after noticing a blackened lesion under his big toenail. He was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer. The doctor advised Marley to amputate his toe to prevent the spread of cancer. But he refused because he thought it would violate the Rasta prohibition against the “cutting of the flesh,” and opted for a less invasive procedure.The cancer eventually spread. Marley died on May 11, 1981, in Miami while trying to return to his beloved Jamaica for his final days. A man who was a fitness and health food fanatic died at 36.Marley was honored with a state funeral in Jamaica at the National Arena in Kingston. He was buried with his favorite Gibson Les Paul guitar and his personalized Bible, opened to Psalm 23, which begins with, “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.”In an interview several years before his death, Marley said a person achieves a sense of immortality by having a right relationship with God.“I don’t believe in death, neither in flesh nor in spirit . . . Death does not exist for me. I truly know God,” Marley said.His musical legacy has found an afterlife. Marley’s stature on the international stage has only grown in the decades since his death. It’s ironic that Marley, a fierce critic of capitalism and materialism, posthumously generated $16 million through his estate in 2023, according to Forbes magazine, right behind John Lennon of the Beatles.That type of immortality, of course, wasn’t what Marley was talking about. He alluded to an “ever-living” legacy. It’s the faith of an abandoned kid from the slums of Jamaica who knew hardship and abandonment but assured his listeners in his classic “Three Little Birds,” “Don’t worry about a thing, ‘Cause every little thing is gonna be alright.”Somewhere in the world right now someone is playing a Bob Marley song to help them get through a difficult time — the kind that tears a hole in someone’s soul.Marley was right. When it comes to his music and his spiritual message — death does not exist.He is more alive today than ever before.John Blake is the author of “More Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.”"

        "title": "‘Elsbeth’ turns Carrie Preston’s ‘The Good Wife’ role into a breezy good time",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "After fighting “The Good Fight” for streaming, the producers of “The Good Wife” indulge in a more CBS-friendly spinoff with “Elsbeth,” which breezily takes Carrie Preston’s quirky title character and turns her into a modern version of “Columbo.” About all that’s missing is the latter’s “Oh, one thing” method of springing the final trap.The pilot sets up Elsbeth Tascioni’s fast-talking attorney by relocating her from Chicago to New York, where she’s positively giddy about everything associated with the Big Apple, from the Statue of Liberty to the theater. The reason for said move involves having her become the appointed liaison to oversee the police because of a consent decree related to what she diplomatically describes as “some teeny corruption problems.”Of course, the NYPD and its captain (Wendell Pierce, somewhat underemployed) aren’t thrilled about having Elsbeth around, and he assigns a quiet officer (Carra Patterson) to keep an eye on her. Still, Elsbeth’s mandate provides her with the opportunity to wade into investigations, and she does so with a disarming style that causes everyone to underestimate her.Created by Robert and Michelle King, there’s a teeny serialized aspect to the premise, but really not much that departs from the classic murder-of-the-week format. The series also employs the old device of identifying the killer in the early moments, putting the audience a step ahead of everyone except perhaps Elsbeth, who has a knack for zeroing in on the smallest of clues.The episodes previewed include Stephen Moyer, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Jane Krakowski as guest stars, with Ferguson portraying the producer of a very Bravo-like reality show called “Lavish Ladies,” where one of the regulars winds up dead.Preston received a guest-star Emmy for the role back in 2013, so the stand-alone series represents a long-delayed effort to wring extra mileage from “The Good Wife’s” legacy while hewing to the kind of comfort-food formula that still works reasonably well for the traditional networks – an appetite CBS has recently fed with its other new procedural drama, “Tracker.”Granted, there’s not a whole lot about that approach to prompt wild enthusiasm, but to those looking for a modest diversion, Preston is good company, and the writing is intermittently clever. Besides, the irrepressible Elsbeth has enough enthusiasm for all of us.“Elsbeth” premieres February 29 at 10 p.m. ET on CBS."

        "title": "Adam Sandler is working on ‘Happy Gilmore 2,’ according to Christopher McDonald",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "It sounds like Adam Sandler might be teeing up a sequel to his famed 1996 golf comedy “Happy Gilmore,” at least according to actor Christopher McDonald.McDonald, who played Shooter McGavin – the notorious arch nemesis of Sandler’s character Happy Gilmore – teased the possibility of a “Happy Gilmore 2” during an interview on Friday’s episode of “Audacy’s 92.3 The Fan” radio show.“I saw Adam about two weeks ago… And he shows me the first draft of ‘Happy Gilmore 2,’” McDonald said, referring to a script he said that Sandler showed him.He joked that the hosts he was speaking with may want to “cut that out” of the radio show because, he said, “I don’t wanna be a liar, but he did show me that, and I thought, ‘Well, that would be awesome.’”“So, it’s in the works. Fans demand it, dammit!” McDonald said. He later added that when he saw the script, he said he was “very, very pleased.”CNN had reached out to representatives for McDonald and Sandler for comment.Sandler co-wrote “Happy Gilmore” and it became one of his most popular films. It follows Happy Gilmore (Sandler), a not-so-mild-mannered wannabe hockey player who discovers that he’s an exceptionally talented golfer with a slapshot-style swing.He joins a golf tournament to try to win some money in an attempt to help save his grandmother’s house that she’s on the verge of losing. Gilmore goes on to become a golf legend, but his outrageous temperament and untraditional style catches the ire of golf pro Shooter McGavin (McDonald).The 1996 slapstick comedy stars Julie Bowen, Frances Bay, Kevin Nealon and Carl Weathers – who died last month at age 76 – alongside Sandler and McDonald.“Happy Gilmore” was released during a prophetic era for Sandler, who starred in a number of other beloved comedy classics throughout the ’90s, including “Billy Madison,” “Big Daddy” and “The Waterboy.”"

        "title": "‘Freaknik’ documentary producers and director didn’t shy away from telling the full story",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "When the documentary “Freaknik: The Wildest Party Never Told” was first announced, there were some concerns.What began as a picnic for Atlanta HBCU students in 1983, later grew into an annual spring break destination that attracted thousands from across the country. The thought of resurfaced footage from wilder days and a time before cell phones and social media didn’t go over well with some attendees, now well into – or – past middle age.“If you gonna tell the story, you have to tell the whole story,” Nikki Byles, one of the producers of the documentary told CNN.And that’s what she and the production team set out to do.The new documentary boasts among its executive producers hip-hop elders Luther “Uncle Luke” Campbell and Jermaine Dupri, along with rapper 21 Savage, who at 31 is too young to have attended Freaknik, but still celebrated his 30th birthday with a Freaknik-themed party.“I think it speaks to this whole fact that there’s a nostalgia about the nineties and wanting to go back to that time and that fun that we had,” P. Frank Williams, who directed and executive produced the documentary, said of the fascination younger people have with the event that ended in 1999. “Freaknik has this sort of magical lore.”Williams compared it to a “Black Woodstock” with nostalgia, freedom, and, of course, music.“Ironically, that’s how we came up with the story because we were sitting in the office laughing and talking about how we would’ve acted with Freaknik,” Byles recalled. “We were mad ‘cause we (were too young at the time and) couldn’t go.”The event helped give rise to Southern hip-hop and acts like OutKast, who were evangelized beyond Atlanta as attendees took their music back home to their cities after the event.Deshawn Plair served as supervising producer on the documentary.“It’s also a coming-of-age story,” Plair said. “You were able to come of age, but not have that pressure to have to be in the spotlight, not have that pressure to have cameras all over you. I think it was just such a bit of Black joy.”The filmmakers incorporated video footage from festival attendees and news reports to revisit what Freaknik was like. Part of that includes growing crowds that in some instances led to chaos and alleged crime, including reports of groping and sexual assault.“In telling the full story of Freaknik, to omit the sexual assault and to omit the things that did cause harm is not allowing the full story to be told,” producer Jay Allen said. “So we just wanted to make sure that as you watch this, that no other documentary about Freaknik ever has to be told.”Revisiting an historic cultural event through a modern lens, for Williams, meant exploring the problems, politics – and the fun – of Freaknik.“I’m a documentarian of Black culture, and I wanted to give the vegetables and the candy. I think a lot of people are in love with the candy, which is the turn up at the street parties, the wilding out on the freeway, the going crazy in the middle of the street at Freaknik,” Williams said. “I wanted to do a much more layered look.”“Freaknik: The Wildest Party Never Told” starts streaming on Hulu Thursday."

        "title": "‘Palm Royale’ can’t live up to its starry cast of desperate ’60s-era housewives",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "There’s so much talent packed into “Palm Royale” that you’d think – or at least hope – the net result would be better. Yet this attempt to do a sort-of “Desperate Housewives” set in Florida in 1969 begins with great promise before becoming ever more ridiculous, until a beached whale in a later episode inadvertently signals that the show has jumped the shark before the sun can set on the 10-episode first season.What that leaves, mostly, is a chance to admire the flamboyant performances, which, in the elder-statesperson division, including a supporting part for Carol Burnett and fleeting opportunity for Laura Dern to play scenes with her dad, Bruce Dern.The focus, though, sits squarely on Maxine (“SNL” alum Kristen Wiig, who doubles as a producer), a social climber essentially squatting in the house of Burnett’s elderly matriarch while trying to fulfill her dream of winning over Palm Beach society, and particularly the wealthy wives that congregate at the Palm Royale, billed as “the most exclusive club in the world.”Maxine begins by sneaking onto the property and endeavoring to befriend the suspicious women, whose de facto leader, Evelyn (Allison Janney at her snooty best), is immediately and rightly suspicious of her. That extended roster includes Dinah (Leslie Bibb), who is hiding her own potentially exploitable secrets.“It’s not my night. It’s cancer’s night,” Dinah says, insincerely, while being lauded for hosting a charity event.Maxine also strikes up relationships with Linda (the younger Dern), a born-into-wealth political activist who is fighting for women’s rights and racial equality, issues that Maxine, a former pageant queen, sees as less significant than achieving her personal goals; and Robert (Ricky Martin), a nosy waiter. As for Maxine’s husband (Josh Lucas), he generally supports her, without fully buying into the program.The unsettled political environment of those times plays a recurring role in the series, with Richard Nixon intermittently popping up on the TV and the space program, with its ties to Florida, among the threads woven into the story.Like so many recent streaming series (and “Palm Royale” is clearly set up to continue beyond this season), the show incorporates a mystery that’s teased early to help carry the audience through to the end. That curiosity, though, gradually wanes due to the situations becoming more exaggerated and absurd as the season drags on, with the whale serving as a very big sign of how much the writing has drifted off course.That still leaves the cast and performances to enjoy, which isn’t nothing, and might qualify as a guilty pleasure for those unperturbed by a show with roughly the substance of a balmy breeze. “Palm Royale” nevertheless feels like an underachiever, a wannabe that doesn’t earn a place in the exclusive elite-series club to which it aspires.“Palm Royale” premieres March 21 on Apple TV+.

I called my former best friend and I was like, ‘You’re out. Taylor’s in. You never invited me on a jet to your game.’”Carmichael added that he should have asked Swift to appear on his new docuseries, a reality show featuring conversations with Carmichael and his loved ones.The comedian even suggested headlines for the stories that would inevitably follow his “annoucement” on Swift.“I won’t even get top-billing! It’ll say: ‘Taylor Swift: Jerrod Carmichael’s Best Friend?’ Don’t do that to me, it’s gotta be something else,” he joked. “I do love her though.”“The Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show” debuts on March 29 on HBO and Max, which like CNN are part of Warner Bros.

        "title": "‘Apples Never Fall’ grows from the twisty roots of a Liane Moriarty mystery",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "After “Big Little Lies” and “Nine Perfect Strangers,” author Liane Moriarty has graduated to the point where nearly everything she’s put on paper will likely be adapted for the screen, really just boiling down to execution. The latest, “Apples Never Fall,” provides a healthy dollop of “Big Little Lies” energy, thanks in part to an excellent cast headed by Sam Neill and Annette Bening.Like most of Moriarty’s stories, this one deals with a mystery within a mystery, jumping around in time (labeling those sequences “then” and “now”) while shifting perspectives from episode to episode among the various characters. At seven chapters, this Peacock production has the advantage of being the rare limited series that milks the premise without overdoing it.The show focuses on the Delaney family, presided over by accomplished tennis coaches Stan (Neill) and his wife Joy (Bening), whose tutelage of young players included some of their four children, played by Alison Brie, Jake Lacy, Conor Merrigan-Turner, and Essie Randles.Yet as Stan and Joy retire, they’re soon interrupted by a young woman, Savannah (Australian actor Georgia Flood), in need of refuge from what she describes as an abusive boyfriend.To the chagrin of the kids and eventually Stan, Savannah essentially moves in, becoming a valuable aide, companion and even de facto daughter to Joy, before Joy goes missing, which triggers both a mad hunt for her and suspicions around Stan, whose temper and past bad behavior gradually drips back through the course of the flashbacks.Then again, that’s just one of the family secrets uncovered as the search continues, fraying relationships that were already pretty fragile, with plenty of old wounds, squandered opportunities and resentment just below the surface.As adapted by showrunner Melanie Marnich (whose recent credits include Hulu’s less effective “A Murder at the End of the World”), “Apples Never Fall” deftly dribbles out clues, fostering uncertainty about what happened while building toward a conclusion that’s not as satisfying as it should be, but good enough.Mostly, the show serves as a worthy binge and a solid showcase for the stars – including Bening, coming off an Oscar nomination for “Nyad” – with the one disclaimer being that it probably won’t garner the same level of attention on Peacock as it might have on another streaming platform.“Apples Never Fall” also reinforces a sense that Moriarty’s books are particularly well suited to the popular limited-series format, a case of fortuitous timing. It’s often wryly noted that in tennis, “love” means “nothing,” but it means something here. As for the old expression “How do you like them apples?,” in this case, happily, the answer is quite a lot.“Apples Never Fall” premieres March 14 on Peacock."

        "title": "This veteran actor plays an immigration lawyer in a new movie. In real life he’s fighting his own case",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "A lawyer stares across his desk and gives his client a dire warning.“You have a month to find someone to cosign your visa,” he says. “If you don’t, you have to leave the US.”It’s another bleak day at Khalil Immigration Law, where people losing their cases vanish into thin air, and even a gold plaque on the waiting room wall promises to make no promises, featuring a motto that tepidly declares, “We’ll do what we can!”If that sounds absurd, it should. The law office is one of many deliberately strange places viewers of the new film “Problemista” will see as they follow protagonist Alejandro’s desperate quest to stay in the United States and achieve his dreams.In this scene early in the movie, which stars writer-director Julio Torres and released in theaters nationwide Friday, Mr. Khalil is pushing Torres’ Alejandro to come up with a solution — and fast. Could a woman Alejandro has just met become his sponsor?“I mean, we’ll see,” Alejandro says with a shrug.Khalil, played by Laith Nakli, perks up and races to scribble on his notepad. Has the lawyer come up with an exciting new legal strategy or an idea that cracks the case? Not at all.“We’ll see,” Khalil repeats with a smile, sweeping his hand through the air as he envisions the phrase on a new waiting room plaque. “That’s a much better motto for us.”It’s one of the many humorous moments punctuating “Problemista,” a film that highlights the uncertainties of the US immigration system — and the surreal twists and turns faced by people trying to navigate it.Alejandro pushes forward against the odds, and despite the crazed whims of a boss (art critic Elizabeth Asencio, played by Tilda Swinton) whose default setting is shouting and picking fights with everyone around her.For Torres, it’s a fictional story — but a personal one, too.“I’ve been living with these feelings for so long. It just makes sense that they poured out in a movie,” he told CNN in a recent interview. The former “SNL” writer came to the US from El Salvador as a college student. And he can still remember the panic he felt when trying to land a job and switch from a student visa to a work visa after graduation. “I would wake up and my heart was already racing,” he says.Long before taking on the part of “Problemista’s” well-meaning but ineffective immigration lawyer, Nakli says he also knew that feeling of dread all too well. Off-screen, he sees his own journey in Alejandro’s story. And as he helps promote the film, he’s speaking out about a side of himself that few people have seen.For years, Nakli has only talked about it with his closest friends. But he says he feels it constantly.“I call it the dark cloud that follows me everywhere,” he tells CNN in a Zoom interview from his New York apartment.It’s been more than 30 years since the UK-born Nakli came to the United States from Damascus, Syria. And it’s been more than 20 years since a 1998 arrest in New York on federal charges threw his life into turmoil and eventually landed him in deportation proceedings.Back then, he was a champion bodybuilder who’d started training in the US and gone on to win the title of “Mr. Syria.”In 2000, shortly before the criminal case was set to head to trial, Nakli pleaded guilty to four counts of conspiracy to possess and distribute controlled substances. At the time, he told the judge that he was working as a bodybuilder and personal trainer when out of loyalty he agreed to serve as a courier for a good friend.The steroids inside the black garbage bags he hauled across the city in his Jeep were never explicitly discussed, according to Nakli’s testimony. But, Nakli said as he pleaded guilty, “deep in my heart, I knew what I was going to pick up.”Later that year, he was sentenced to three years’ probation, community service and a $3,000 fine. In court that day, he apologized for his conduct and vowed it would never happen again.“I love America. So when I got in trouble, it was the most horrific thing that I’ve ever felt, because I felt like I messed up, and I betrayed this trust and this country that welcomed me, that open opened its arms … to embrace me, and gave me a chance to do whatever I want to do,” Nakli says.Nakli left his bodybuilding career behind and turned to acting, something he’d dreamed of pursuing ever since he was a kid watching “King Kong.”As his acting career blossomed, his legal issues followed him. But as he appeared in films like “The Visitor” and “The Wall,” or in TV shows like “Ramy,” “Ms. Marvel” or “Madame Secretary,” many didn’t know about his private battles. Nakli says shame stopped him from sharing his story with all but his closest confidants for years.The crime could have led to his deportation. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s case against him was administratively closed in 2013 under the Obama administration’s prosecutorial discretion policy. While that decision brought him some relief and allows him to live legally in the US, Nakli says the cloud over his head has remained. Any misstep — or a change in political winds — could lead to the case getting reopened.For 25 years, he hasn’t been able to travel outside the country. That’s kept him from visiting his ailing father, and it’s forced him to turn down acting jobs for projects shooting internationally. He’s avoided personal relationships, afraid of what might happen if he’s deported.And every year, as he goes to renew his temporary green card, he fears everything he’s built will slip away.“Every morning, I wake up — every action of every day, every conversation I have, it’s in the back of my head,” Nakli says.And through it all, Nakli says he’s become intimately familiar with the tense waiting room scenes that Alejandro’s character goes through in “Problemista” — albeit without the surreal touch of someone vanishing into thin air once the last grain of sand slips through an hourglass with their name on it.“You can hear a pin drop, but it’s not because of the ‘no phones’ (rules). You can look at the people’s faces. And you see horror and fear,” he says. “It’s like the scariest thing when you go in there.”Nakli didn’t reveal the parallels between his life and the movie’s plot when he auditioned for the “Problemista” part. But he says once the film was in production it came up quickly in a conversation with Torres.“The moment we had an opportunity to sit down after we did the first scene (in the immigration law office), and then we sat and talked a little bit…I just told him. And I think he was like, ‘Whoa.’ Nobody expects that,” Nakli recalls.In 2022, an attorney for Nakli filed an official request for a presidential pardon. If the clemency application is granted, Nakli says it would clear the way for him to become a US citizen and dramatically change his life.There’s no doubt Nakli’s push to get a pardon adds a layer of irony to his portrayal of an immigration lawyer in the film. Torres says it also highlights a unique situation many immigrants face.“In Laith’s case, it’s like, if you were American, this would never come up. … Something that happened in the ’90s? No, you’d probably never think about it,” Torres said at a recent event discussing the film with the Texas-based immigrant advocacy organization RAICES. “But because the system is so unforgiving, there’s just no moving away from it. … That pressure is just completely unfair.”Critics have called “Problemista” a “trippy” and “inventive” film that draws viewers in with “charming silliness” and a “marvelous mixture of surrealism and social satire.”Even at their most whimsical, in some ways, the film’s magical realist touches aren’t far off from the reality of the US immigration system, where Kafkaesque absurdities abound. In real life, many records are kept on paper and locked underground in limestone caves. It can take decades for someone to immigrate legally. Some new arrivals face criticism for failing to support themselves, even though the government hasn’t given them permission to work legally.“One of the original titles I considered for the film was ‘Snakes and Ladders,’” Torres says. “Because that’s really what it feels like. It’s like, ‘Oh, you got far, but, oh, now you’re back to Square One.’ It felt all-encompassing, which I think is relatable to people who haven’t been through any sort of immigration problem. It’s a state of being, almost…(like) people navigating the insurance system. … It’s a mess.”Like Alejandro, Torres says when he was trying to get a work visa and searching for a way to pay for it, he was forced to turn to the gig economy and Craigslist (personified in several surreal scenes of the film by Larry Owens).Torres says the “absurdity” of that time is something he remembers vividly. And it’s depicted in one particularly telling scene of “Problemista.” The film’s narrator, voiced by Isabella Rosselini, outlines the complexities of Alejandro’s predicament as he’s shown on-screen crawling through a seemingly infinite staircase made up of stark rooms filled with file cabinets:The rules of the game are as follows: First, you must find a sponsor for a work visa. Then, you must submit it by paying application and lawyer fees totaling up to around $6,000 dollars. And only then is Alejandro allowed to earn money — money that he needs so he can submit his application to well, earn money. And he must do it before the fall of the last grain of sand. The maze is impossible to navigate. Unless, of course, he’s willing to bend the rules.While the memorable maze scene echoes the “Snakes and Ladders” title Torres once considered, in the end, he picked a different name for the film. “Problemista,” he says, is a made-up word that he defines as “someone who thrives in problems or creates art from problems.”“The movie isn’t a documentary that dismantles and is an indictment of the immigration system,” he says. “The movie is just a story about a very specific person going through a very specific thing.”Alejandro is a problemista. And Torres says he is, too.But as another fellow problemista starring in “Problemista,” Nakli says Torres’ ways of portraying how it feels to navigate the immigration system are nothing short of a revelation.“He really captured the immigrant experience and what it’s like,” Nakli says.The cloud Nakli feels every day wasn’t literally depicted on-screen, but Nakli says he saw it clearly hovering over Alejandro’s every move.“You might as well have had a CGI cloud just following him everywhere. Because that’s what it’s like. Your imaginary friend becomes this cloud,” Nakli says. “And you don’t know this cloud, what is it going to produce? Is the sun going to seep through it at the end? Or is it going to hail? Is it going to be a storm? You don’t know.”For his part, Nakli sees a ray of hope in his pardon request. A Justice Department website lists it among thousands of pending applications. There’s no indication of when a decision could come.Nakli’s application, which the actor shared with CNN, points out that at sentencing the judge described him as a “minor participant” in the offense, and that Nakli has taken significant steps to rehabilitate since his conviction.The application includes numerous letters of support from fellow actors and others who say knowing him changed their lives.Ramy Youssef, the Golden Globe-winning creator and star of Hulu’s “Ramy,” praises Nakli’s “inspirational talent.” In his letter supporting Nakli’s pardon application, he writes that Nakli once gave him a camera and helped him get a scholarship for acting classes that were instrumental in the way his career took shape.“The way Laith has helped me is the way he helps everyone he meets. There are many people in New York, and around the world, who have a story about how Laith helped them. Making introductions, lending people money, housing someone in between places — Laith is that kind of person,” Youssef writes. “He’s been a huge part of so many people’s personal lives, and careers.”A former Secret Service agent who met Nakli in acting school points out that Nakli already served his sentence for the crimes he committed and doesn’t deserve to be punished indefinitely.And Nakli notes that the DEA agents who arrested him and the judge who sentenced him likely saved his life.“Had I remained a bodybuilder, the dangerous lifestyle would have eventually killed me,” he writes.Nakli says the story he was once ashamed of revealing now is one he wants to share. He’s written it into a one-man show about his life. And he’s been speaking about it with reporters and others as he promotes “Problemista.”“I’m at a point where I’m very open about it,” he said at the recent RAICES event. “Yes, I made a mistake. I broke the law and I paid the price for it. And I’ve been doing everything right ever since.”Second chances, he says, are also a vital part of the America he’s come to know and love. And he hopes his pardon application will give him the chance for a new start.“I answer every call that I get, even if I don’t know the number, because I don’t know if it’s going to be (the one),” he says.But Nakli says he’s emotionally prepared for any outcome.And there’s one key difference between him and the ghostly figures of rejected immigrants in “Problemista.”The actor who’s made his mark in dozens of TV and film roles will not disappear.CNN’s Julie In and Hayley Wilson contributed to this report."

        "title": "Let ‘Dune: Part Two’ inspire you to revisit these other timeless sci-fi sequels",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "“Dune: Part Two” is landing in theaters this weekend, and the movie is already a promising franchise hit, with (to date) an impressive 94% critical rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and an audience score one percentage point higher.After 2021’s first entry fared similarly well – and picked up a total of six Academy Awards – the zeitgeist is inevitably comparing director Denis Villeneuve’s sprawling world of “Dune” to those of “Star Wars” and “Lord of the Rings.” With that said, there’s no time like the present to use Arrakis, the desert planet at the heart of “Dune,” as the jumping-off point to explore other amazing sequels in science-fiction, a genre that’s luckily been fertile ground for various second chapters in cinema.Behold, a list of some the most notable, in no particular order.What better way to start off than with one of the greatest sequels – and sci-fi films in general – ever made, with a screenplay that’s been taught in film schools. James Cameron’s Oscar-winning followup to Ridley Scott’s haunted-house-in-space classic from 1979 broke the mold in many ways, from its deft ability to develop every member of the ensemble cast of mercenaries to the heart-wrenching crux of the story, Ellen Ripley’s (Sigourney Weaver) fiercely protective and maternal relationship with a young survivor named Newt (Carrie Henn). And that’s not to mention the absolutely iconic face-off between Ripley and another maternal figure in the movie – namely the horrifying Alien Queen, as seen above.A groundbreaking achievement in terms of special effects and world-building at the time, “Star Trek II” was a sequel no one saw coming, as it felt very different from the troubled first feature film based on the historic television series. From early use of CGI to full-throttle performances from both heroic William Shatner and villainous Ricardo Montalban, “Khan” stands the test of time – especially with that whopper of an ending.James Cameron (yes, he’s been referred to as the king of sequels) struck cinematic sequel gold again with his awe-inspiring revisit of a world fated to be dominated by evil killer robots, and the few people – along with a now friendly cyborg in Arnold Schwarzenegger’s most unforgettable performance – who stand in the way. Among its many, many credits, including a truly badass turn from Linda Hamilton as a stronger and more resilient Sarah Connor – the second “Terminator” also marked a massive leap forward for CGI effects, helping to lay the groundwork for “Jurassic Park” and beyond.After a bold new beginning in 2011’s “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” this sequel raised the stakes in this rebooted franchise that finally had the incredible special effects to back up an idea first planted with the 1968 original. Featuring Andy Serkis in top form as ape leader Caesar, “Dawn” builds to an explosive crescendo anchored by chilling post-apocalyptic visions and real emotion, as viewers are confronted with the true nature of what it means to be human. A fourth entry to the series, “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” is out this summer.In the post-apocalyptic space, it doesn’t get any more bonkers than the world of Mad Max, which has seen several sequels reinvent and build upon what came before in truly eye-popping fashion. Franchise mastermind George Miller’s second entry “The Road Warrior” took the ingredients from his gritty first outing and crystallized them into a superb sequel, while the third installment remains memorable if for no other reason than Tina Turner’s unbelievable appearance as the menacing Auntie Entity. Thirty years later, the Tom Hardy- and Charlize Theron-led reboot “Fury Road” showed just how many new mind-bending possibilities there were for this world. Miller is at work on not one but two new installments, including an origin story for Theron’s Furiosa starring Anya Taylor-Joy.While this franchise borders on both the supernatural and comedy genres, it deserves a place on this list for being an inventive and under-appreciated sequel that took the elements from the original “Ghostbusters” and ran with them. Giving more room for performers including Annie Potts, Rick Moranis, Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver to play – not to mention a truly madcap performance from Peter MacNicol as an outlandish museum employee-turned-possessed demon, sometimes in drag – “Ghostbusters II” still brings the chills as well as the fun, giving new meaning to the idea of “feel-good music” thanks to the prominent placement of “(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher” as sung by Howard Huntsberry.Truly and deservedly the “father” of all sequels, “Empire” blew the spaceship door off the “Star Wars ” franchise and is most likely the reason it has not only lasted this long, but become a perennial element in pop culture the world over. Its blueprint for deepening the story and expanding the characters has been followed – but never bested – by many a sequel since, including “Dune: Part Two” (the source material of which, it must be said, served as a heavy influence for George Lucas when he was first conceiving his “Star Wars” universe). If for no other reason, the decision to end “Empire” on not only a cliffhanger, but a down note at that, is a daring move few franchises have ever attempted, “Dune” among them.“Dune: Part Two” is produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, which, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery."

        "text": "In romantic comedies, casual sex isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and the commitment-phobic eventually see the error of their ways. The Netflix movie “Players” follows that basic playbook, but the fun is in getting there, thanks largely to Gina Rodriguez as the leader of a gang of friends who operate like a “Mission: Impossible”-type team for the purpose of orchestrating one-night stands.Nobody should expect too much of a movie in this genre released on Valentine’s Day, and grading on that curve, “Players” happily punches above its weight class and exceeds expectations.Rodriguez’s Mack and her longtime buddies (played by Damon Wayans Jr., Augustus Prew and Joel Courtney) hang out together until it’s time to leap into action and “run a play,” employing one of several tried-and-true methods they’ve developed in order to arrange random hookups.By day, they work for a newspaper where Mack works as a sportswriter, and, in what’s definitely a sign of the times, stresses about whether the next round of layoffs might catch up with her.Before you can say “Boomerang,” though, Mack meets dashing author Nick (“Lucifer’s” Tom Ellis), and tumbles into bed with him, only later deciding that she wants to try and have an actual relationship with him. (“Mission accomplished” would mean being offered a drawer in his apartment for her stuff, which owes a small debt to another movie from this well-worn genre, “About Last Night.”)Although initially horrified that Mack would try to parlay their encounter into a deeper relationship after running a “play,” her buddies join in her elaborate scheme to woo Nick, and one of them, Adam (Wayans), even wonders aloud whether it’s “time to be adults” – a signal that their life of easy hookups might be coming to an end.Of course, nothing’s ever as simple as that, and director Trish Sie (“Pitch Perfect 3” and the more recent “Sitting in Bars With Cake”) and writer Whit Anderson throw in hurdles and wrinkles. Fortunately, Rodriguez spent five seasons trying to figure out who she should be with on “Jane the Virgin,” so she’s got plenty of experience dealing with that particular conundrum.“Players” isn’t here to carve out any new ground, merely to cover familiar territory as pleasantly as possible. And as Mack or any other sportswriter could tell you, when calling a basic play, success really boils down to execution and making the right calls.“Players” premieres February 14 on Netflix."

        "title": "You have to really like William Shatner to get aboard ‘You Can Call Me Bill’",
        "category": "entertainment",
        "text": "William Shatner and his most famous role have always been ripe for parody, and the “Star Trek” star, now 93, has endearingly reached the point where he can laugh a little at himself. Yet a new documentary, “William Shatner: You Can Call Me Bill,” tests one’s level of Shatner fandom, letting him indulge in a 90-some-odd-minute monologue about life, death and legacies.What might have been more accurately called “The World According to Bill” dispenses with third-party voices, or for that matter, having Shatner do any serious reminiscing about other people he’s known.Instead, writer-director Alexandre O. Philippe engages the actor in a highly philosophical conversation about life and the prospect of death, while sprinkling footage from his one-man shows and career throughout, ranging from more obscure and early film and TV roles to his near-60-year association with Captain James T. Kirk.Along the way, Shatner waxes eloquent about the miracle of the universe, the “mystical” bond forged between rider and horse, his history of “taking care of my inner child,” and his determination to “live in the now.”While that approach is certainly intimate – including Shatner discussing his emotional reaction to traveling into space aboard Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin flight in 2021 – the film lacks context about the actor, or anything that would hint at controversies in his life. As a “for instance,” there’s no mention of the criticism he’s received from “Trek” co-stars, and not much about his interactions with “Trekkie” culture or the cathartic moment in a “Saturday Night Live” sketch in which he snapped at convention attendees to “Get a life.”Charitably, “You Can Call Me Bill” serves as an opportunity for anyone who has admired Shatner’s screen work from afar, including post-“Star Trek” roles like “Boston Legal,” to know him a little better, while providing the actor a chance to share some of his professional inspirations (Laurence Olivier and Marlon Brando among them) and personal insights he’s accrued over his long life.Still, for an actor known for having led his crew as it boldly explored humankind’s final frontier, “You Can Call Me Bill,” somewhat disappointingly, takes its extensive access to Shatner and doesn’t go much of anywhere.“William Shatner: You Can Call Me Bill” premieres in select theaters on March 22."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "A treasure hunter struggling with faulty equipment has unearthed a gold nugget believed to be the largest ever found in England.Richard Brock discovered the gold nugget, weighing 64.8 grams (2.3 ounces), in the country’s Shropshire Hills near the border with Wales, auction house Mullock Jones said Thursday.The nugget is around the size of a UK 50 pence coin.The find, nicknamed Hiro’s Nugget, has an estimated worth of between £30,000 ($38,000) and £40,000 ($50,700), according to Shropshire-based Mullock Jones, which is handling the sale.However, it almost seemed that luck had eluded Brock, whose equipment almost failed him on the day of the dig.When Brock arrived at the site in Shropshire in May, he discovered that his metal detector was faulty, according to a press release from Mullock Jones.As his hopes dimmed, he turned to a piece of older equipment. At first he found only a coin of little value, but within five minutes he made the shocking discovery, the auction house said.“It just goes to show that it doesn’t really matter what equipment you use, if you are walking over the find and are alert enough to what might be lurking underneath the soil, that makes all the difference,” Brock said in the release.The nugget is considered to be a “rare find,” auctioneer Ben Jones of Mullock Jones told CNN Thursday. How it made it to the dig site is a mystery.Parts of the Shropshire Hills were once under a prehistoric ocean, and pieces of coral are often unearthed there, according to the auction house.“The site does contain an old road/ railway line and has remnants of Welsh stone within,” auctioneer Jones said, adding: “So [there’s] a variety of possibilities of how it made it there.”The auction ends April 1.Although Hiro’s Nugget is believed to be the largest discovered so far in England, several previous finds in other parts of the United Kingdom dwarf it in size.The record holder is the 121.3-gram [4.3 ounces] Reunion Nugget, found in Scotland in 2019."

        "title": "Life in limbo: Photographer documents ‘Kafka-esque’ migrant experience",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Photographer Felipe Romero Beltrán’s depiction of a migrant facility in Spain oozes with the boredom and malaise of life in legal limbo. His young subjects are seen smoking cigarettes, lifting weights and trimming one another’s hair. Other images show them hanging out in a grubby yard or lying around on mattresses.The photos were shot with the help of nine young Moroccans whom Beltrán befriended in Seville, capital of the southern region of Andalucía. Published in his new book “Dialect,” the pictures were initially intended to be personal, not political. But they ultimately spoke to what Beltrán called a “Kafka-esque” system in which the men waited for years to learn whether their residency applications would be approved.“At the beginning, it was just about this group of guys,” Beltrán said on a video call from Madrid. “But of course, I realized that I was photographing these really specific political bodies, or political subjects in this bureaucracy.”Last year, nearly 30,000 migrants arrived in Spain by sea, down from a record of over 58,000 in 2018, according to UNHCR data. Of these, most arrived in the Canary Islands or Andalucía, a region separated from Morocco by the Strait of Gibraltar, a stretch of water just 13 kilometers (eight miles) at its narrowest.The nine men, who didn’t previously know one another, were among those to arrive by boat during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in search of a better life. Recounting his journey with an essay in “Dialect,” one of Beltrán’s subjects, Youssef Elhafidi, recalls another terrified teen migrant being forced by smugglers to pilot their boat.“He did not want to drive, the fear was paralyzing him, they took out a knife and put it on his neck, threatening him to start the engines,” Elhafidi wrote. “The boy started the machine between trembling and crying and we headed north.”According to Beltrán, his nine subjects were required to stay in Spain for three continuous years before applying for residency. Undocumented and without the right to work during this time, they were dependent on the state for food and housing.While living at the government-run facility, the men took Spanish lessons and joined workshops to help them adapt to life in Spain — some of which were run by Beltrán.Overcoming an initial language barrier, the photographer began working with the group to produce images and videos. As well as candid portraits, the pictures focus on conditions at the facility, from peeling walls to basic food supplies.Many of the images were, however, staged. As Beltrán looked for different ways to engage with his subjects, he asked them to re-enact moments from their respective migration journeys. In one, a subject lies motionless on blue gym mats, just as he had upon landing on Spain’s coast. Another shows two of the men carrying a third on their shoulders to recreate the moment he fainted during a day-long walk to Seville from a small town to its south.The resulting book is thus part documentary and part performance, with Beltrán toeing the line between mentor and collaborator, photographer and choreographer. More than just an artistic decision, staging photos directly responded to the tedium of the migrants’ abundant free time.“There was an activity around taking the images — it was something during the day that (could get them) excited. And it was fun,” Beltrán recalled. “Everyone was laughing, and they just make jokes each other during the sessions.”When Beltrán began delivering workshops at the facility in 2020, he was all too familiar with the system his subjects were trapped in. A few years earlier, he had relocated to Spain from his native Colombia, and — even as a college-educated Spanish speaker — also struggled to navigate the complex immigration processes.To illustrate the challenge facing his francophone subjects, his project included a video titled “Recital” in which they attempted to read the first four pages of the Spanish immigration law that would determine their futures. “They weren’t understanding a word,” he recalled, noting that, although lawyers were assigned to act on the men’s behalf, the language barrier and dense legalese removed their agency.The opening pages of “Dialect” — whose title alludes to these very linguistical challenges — are dedicated to stills from the video. Pictures of the men struggling to comprehend the legislation are overlaid with technical terminology (“Right to effective judicial protection” reads the text on one frame; another says, “Authorizations for the purpose of carrying out profit-making activities”).“These legal procedures are really, really complicated, even for native speakers,” said Beltrán, who is now completing a PhD program in photography in Madrid. “It becomes almost like translation work — translating these laws and bureaucracies into (something understandable to) normal people like us.”The result, he said, is an inevitable sense of helplessness.“You can’t talk with anyone,” Beltrán added. “You can’t ask, ‘Who is the law?’ or ‘Who is the state?’ You don’t have anyone to approach. You don’t have any tools to make a living… The system is built to avoid you, or to deny you access to (it).”Describing the group as “just young people trying to figure out what to do with life,” the photographer hopes his project can humanize migrants’ experiences in a world increasingly desensitized to images of their suffering.Since Beltrán completed his project, most of his subjects have completed their three-year wait and now formally reside in Spain, he says. He remains in touch with some — including Elhafidi, who he says works in a restaurant and has accompanied him at promotional events for the book’s launch.In the conclusion of his essay, Elhafidi recalled how he felt when he secured his residency, writing: “It took me three years of searching and putting courage to life, until finally the moment came, after being cold, scared, hungry and the most difficult thing, my mother’s tears… I got it,” he wrote.“I got the papers. Now after getting it I have another look at life, I finally feel that I have the opportunity to be whoever I want to be.”“They’re building their lives,” Beltrán said of those, including Elhafidi, who have secured residency. “Fortunately, they now can go back to Morocco to visit and see their families.”“Dialect,” published by Loose Joints, is available now."

        "title": "This photographer spent two years documenting life for the women forced to leave Ukraine",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Within hours of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky invoked martial law across the country, setting in motion an ongoing defence operation and signing a decree to mobilize conscripts. With eligible men aged between 18-60 not being allowed to leave Ukraine, news reports were filled with images of mostly women and young children fleeing the country, wrapped in blankets or with grandparents nearby.Like many of us, in the early days of the war, British photographer Polly Braden’s grasp of what was happening was informed by TV and newspaper coverage. In it, she recognized the correlation between what she was witnessing and her own practice. “I’d made this body of work about single parents (‘Holding the Baby,’ 2022), and seeing these women leaving Ukraine, I thought about everything they were going to have to do to support the children and older people they were bringing with them,” she told CNN in an interview.Weeks after those initial reportage images began being shown, Braden flew to Moldova, which shares a border with Ukraine, inspired to work on a new series. “It felt important to record what was going to happen to these women. They were going to have to find housing, schooling, jobs… to build new lives,” she explained. “It also meant they suddenly became refugees — they might have been teachers, lawyers, important people in their community — what was that going to look like for them?” The project would ultimately become an exhibition called “Leaving Ukraine,” currently on display at the Foundling Museum in London.“Of course, it’s important we have pictures of the frontline and what’s happening inside Ukraine, but it’s also important we understand what role women play in war, especially this war, where women have given up their status in their country,” continued Braden, reflecting on the traditionally gendered approach to documenting conflict. “They are safeguarding the next generation of Ukraine.”Spanning two years (the most recent image was taken in early March 2024) and featuring a mix of still photography and moving image, “Leaving Ukraine” closely follows the stories of six women Braden met when she travelled to Moldova: law graduate Lena, pregnant mother Anya, school friends Sofiia, Aliesia and Yuliia, and Narine who left Ukraine with her children and a close friend.Conscious of the work’s broader scope, Braden considers “Leaving Ukraine” not just a depiction of these six women and their families, but also as a reflection of the countries they’ve ended up in, which include Italy, Poland and the UK. According to the UNHCR’s most recent report, Moldova has received over 850,000 Ukrainian refugees and more than 120,000 third country nationals since February 22, 2022. Of them, as of November 12, 2023, more than 113,000 have stayed on in the country.“I thought I’d meet people in a country then follow them building a life there, but not one person I met has landed in a country, found their feet and made it work,” she shared. “They’ve had to move because they can’t find work, there’s no housing, they can’t get their kid to school — or they’ve landed in the countryside in a country they’ve never been to.”Braden describes the project as wholly collaborative, detailing her close work with the women to construct an intimate portrait of their new reality (photographing Anya, for example, just hours after she gave birth). Many of the images are tender studies of private moments, shot in homes, social spaces and on public transport. “They’ve been telling their own story really, I’ve just been holding a camera,” she said.Lena, who Braden recalled had become irritated speaking to journalists in Moldova, later came to live with her in London. The photographer noted how they didn’t take any photos during this period. “I thought it was quite invasive,” she said, reflecting on the trust they’d developed. “After all it’s a privilege, (this work). And finding a new life is like a jigsaw, right?” Lena has since moved out, meeting a partner and having a baby, and Braden is conscious of how the war has affected her family’s trajectory. “The child hopefully will speak Ukrainian, but they’re an English family,” she said.Elsewhere, with two teenagers of her own, the photographer has taken great pleasure in working with the three schoolgirls, one of whom is now studying film in Warsaw and used the project in her coursework. “The most amazing part about following young people, like Sofiia, Aliesia and Yuliia, is they’re optimistic and full of the joys of life,” she said. “Wanting love and all the normal things young people want.”Initially, Braden had envisioned she’d be able to return to Ukraine with some of the women, but with the war now in its third year, that has not yet been possible. Ultimately she determined that the series is about building a life away from home, and “finding new paths in Europe.”Similarly, her commitment to just a small group of families, in tandem with her long-term approach, allowed her to harness greater power in her storytelling. “If we don’t look at individual stories,” she clarified, “then big policies are made without understanding details.”"

        "text": "Besting 111 of her fellow titleholders from across the globe, Krystyna Pyszková of the Czech Republic was crowned Miss World 2024 on Saturday in Mumbai, India, where the international pageant was held this year.Across a series of events during the pageant’s preliminary competition, including fitness, beauty, talent and public speaking, several contestants won “fast track” places in the top 40, a cohort announced at the start of the show.From there, the field was quickly slashed to top 12 and then top eight, at which point the contestants participated in the classic Q&A round, addressing topics discussed at the most recent G20 Summit. Asked to shed light on an issue impacting women’s health care specifically, Pyszková, a 23-year-old law student and model, spoke about removing the stigma and shame surrounding menstruation, saying that “being a woman is a gift” and that periods should not be a taboo subject.After one final cut, four contestants were left to “pitch their purpose” (or philanthropic platform) to a trio of business moguls from “Shark Tank India.” Each of these four finalists represented a different region of the world: Africa, the Americas and Caribbean, Asia and Oceania and Europe.Pyszková’s victory came over these three runners-up — Yasmina Zeytoun of Lebanon, Aché Abrahams of Trinidad and Tobago and Lesego Chombo of Botswana. (These women, along with Jessica Gagen of England, are considered the pageant’s “continental winners.”)Miss World is widely viewed as the oldest international beauty pageant, first founded in the United Kingdom in 1951 as a “bikini contest.” Perhaps its two best-known winners are both from India: the actors Aishwarya Rai Bachchan (Miss World 1994) and Priyanka Chopra Jonas (Miss World 2000). Chopra Jonas appeared at the pageant in a video message, paying tribute to both Miss World owner Julia Morley and Nita Ambani, winner of the pageant’s Humanitarian Award.Pyszková replaces the outgoing Miss World, Karolina Bielawska, of Poland, whose reign dates back to March 2022. (Due to scheduling issues, no Miss World pageant was held in 2023.)"

        "title": "Inside ‘Biba:’ The iconic London store where Anna Wintour was a shop girl",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "“My God, it’s dull,” said interior designer Steven Thomas of the British retail landscape in 2024. As the creative force behind the look of the wildly popular 1970s London fashion store Big Biba, Thomas knows a thing or two about engineering excitement.Big Biba — a daring, 20,000 square foot destination by fashion illustrator Barbara Hulanicki and her former marketing executive husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon — was conceived with a level of detail usually reserved for high-end concept stores. Opened in September 1973, it was the fourth and final outpost of the-then iconic brand. The seven-floor Art Deco emporium on London’s fashionable Kensington High Street featured a soup stand inspired by Andy Warhol, a roof garden featuring real flamingos and penguins, and a much-lauded celebrity hotspot the “Rainbow Room”.“Because the Rainbow Room looked the way it did, it didn’t take long for the glitterati to latch on; it was very much a place to be seen dining,” recalled Thomas in an interview with CNN. Originally designed by architect Marcel Hennequet in 1933 and named after its multi-colored ceiling (the dining room was otherwise all white tablecloths and fake plants), it “became a venue of choice,” he suggested. “David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Bryan Ferry all dropped in.”“Fitz employed the son of a friend who had an extraordinary knack of picking people up, like Ian Dury and the Blockheads,” continued Thomas, recalling the unofficial booker. “He got the New York Dolls to play when they came over, another coup. They did a vandalizing tour of the first floor, shoplifting all the women’s clothes.”These stories and more are all explored in “Welcome to Big Biba,” Thomas’s gold-fronted monograph of the venture republished this month by ACC Art Books to celebrate the brand’s 60th anniversary. “This book is a testament to creative freedom,” writes the now 87-year-old Hulanicki in the foreword, reflecting on her legacy. “You can do it all as long as you learn to wear a suit. Of course, your secret will be that the suit is lined in gold lamé.”The Biba story began in May 1964 when Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon began running “Biba’s Postal Boutique,” a mail-order store selling limited runs of stock. Singer Annie Lennox described the venture as having led “the way for those of us living in provincial places where we felt we were dying of drabness.”Inspired by decadent styles from bygone times — albeit with drastically shortened hemlines — in earthy or muted colors such as olive, rust and “bruised purple,” Biba’s wares certainly struck a chord with young female shoppers, and the brand rode the wave of what Thomas described as “the first burst of teenage energy and finance availability.”“Biba made fashion democratic,” explained Martin Pel, author of “The Biba Years 1963-1975” and curator of a new exhibition at London’s Fashion & Textile Museum, in an email. “This expression is often overused of designers in the 1960s, particularly Mary Quant. Quant’s clothes whilst youthful, were expensive. Biba was inexpensive, well designed, good quality, and up-to-the-minute.”By September 1964, Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon had opened their first brick and mortar store in a former drugstore, twice moving the business into bigger premises throughout the 60s. In 1966 the brand’s second shop on Kensington Church Street — where Vogue editor Anna Wintour famously did a stint as a Saturday girl — was described by Vanity Fair magazine as “the most exotic shop in London.” and in the early 1970s, a boutique launched in New York’s Bergdorf Goodman department store.Interior designer Thomas had already designed Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon’s home and the third Biba store in 1968 before being approached about the landmark seven-level store. “Fitz offered me two floors (of Big Biba) but I wanted it all,” he recalled of his initial involvement. “A moment of complete lunacy, considering Tim (Whitmore, his creative partner) and I were ex-painting students working out of my bedroom. It was an extraordinary act of bravery on their part, giving us the contract, it wouldn’t happen today.”Stocking Big Biba’s seven floors was equal parts intimidating and invigorating said Thomas, explaining that he and Whitmore worked closely with Hulanicki throughout. “Biba was always a reflection of Barbara’s life,” he noted, “so because Barbara had a kid, of course we had a kid’s floor,” with décor inspired by Disney World, a carousel ride and miniature cottage kids café with toadstool seating. On Saturdays, an actor would visit and read stories and a crèche — a revolutionary concept in fashion retail now, let alone 50 years ago — allowed parents freedom to explore the other floors.A maternity section and a space for 11-13 year old’s were similarly modern for the time, likewise the introduction of communal changing rooms — although true to the spirit of the times, many clients reportedly changed in the middle of the store itself.Elsewhere menswear took over the third floor, complete with a “mistress” section for purchasing more sensual items with discretion. Biba-branded household items were upstairs. While each floor took on its own theme (maternity for example was fitted with comedic outsized furniture, inspired by Ken Russell’s 1971 musical comedy “The Boyfriend”), much of the store was furnished in Biba’s distinctive black and gold colorway, with mirrored fixtures, ostrich feathers and leopard print features.While Wintour’s shopgirl life was short-lived, Big Biba’s staff were a vital component of the experience remembered Thomas. “They loved working there, it was their club,” he said. “And if a (customer) bought a Biba poster and stuck it on her wall, she felt part of the club. It was the theater of retail really.”It was an unmitigated success. When the store opened its legendary roof gardens in 1974, they were ushered in by a party described in the British press as “like walking into a film set of rather jolly moral depravity.” Shoppers from all over the country, and even internationally, convened at the store to buy into the zeitgeist. According to Hulanicki, during its two-year run, Big Biba was the number two tourist attraction in the British capital after the Tower of London, with Buckingham Palace being number three.But Biba’s success was short-lived. In 1969, the independent company sold a majority of its shares to another British fashion retailer Dorothy Perkins which, in August 1973 (a month before Big Biba opened), was then bought by a property development company called British Land. The high cost of keeping the store open and the faltering British economy of the mid-70s meant the new owners closed the store’s third and fourth floors in March 1975, and the rest of the store followed that September against the backdrop of a nationwide property slump.Six decades on however, Biba’s legacy outlasts its footprint on the high street. Its low-cost yet well-made clothing is still coveted today, with heirloom designs sometimes retailing for hundreds of dollars. As Pel noted, “today Biba clothes stand as a lesson to both consumers and retailers that inexpensive fashion does not have to be disposable.”"

        "title": "A Whitney Biennial artist’s hidden message, ‘Free Palestine,’ asks viewers to take a long look",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Within an original poem, spelled out in neon lettering, the Indigenous artist Demian DinéYazhi´ hid a message in their installation at the Whitney Biennial in New York. Unknown to the show’s curators, flickering letters across the artwork’s three stanzas reveal the words: “Free Palestine.”Titled “we must stop imagining apocalypse / genocide + we must imagine liberation,” the Diné artist’s new installation joins the works of some 70 other artists and collectives in the 81st edition of the exhibition, which surveys early-career American artists — and has often been a flashpoint for politics and protests.Over email, a Whitney spokesperson confirmed to CNN that the museum “did not know of this subtle detail when the work was installed.” Publicly, it came to light by journalists reporting for Artnet News and The New York Times after the exhibition, titled “Even Better Than the Real Thing,” opened for early previews. (The Biennial will be open to the public as of today.)DinéYazhi´ explained in a phone call with CNN that the installation “became an opportunity to have a commentary on current world events and do so in a way that was respectful to people’s humanity and dignity.”Calls for a ceasefire and an independent Palestinian state have increased in recent months, as Israel’s war on Hamas has killed more than 31,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory’s Ministry of Health, and displaced at least 1.7 million since October. This follows the Hamas-led attack in southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.To DinéYazhi´, “Free Palestine” is a call “for a permanent ceasefire and an end to occupation, genocide, forced migrations of Palestinian peoples and the right of self-determination for Palestinian peoples,” the artist explained.“It asks us to consider what healing and building future societies could look like if we were all liberated from disharmonic and divisive political systems, police states, and nation states,” they added.The artist’s poem reflects on these wider implications, as well as their own history and experiences as an Indigenous person in North America. It reflects on Indigenous resistance and pays tribute to the artist’s friend, the Diné musician and activist Klee Benally, who died in January. And the hidden message is far from the only embedded layer in the neon sign.“It’s a continuation of the work that I have been involved in, speaking about a lot of issues that affect Indigenous communities,” DinéYazhi´said.The poem on which the neon sign was based, which was written by the artist around 2019, eschews religious or cultural fascination with predicting destruction and oppression, and calls instead to imagine liberation.“I was thinking about sci-fi… and Euro-Christian ideas of apocalypse and world-ending, and trying to put that in line with Indigenous ways of viewing the world and Indigenous creation stories,” DinéYazhi´ explained. “And just always seeing conflict come up.”The use of neon — fabricated in collaboration with the New York-based studio Lite Bright Neon — speaks brightly but subtly to a range of interconnected references made by the artist. One is the ubiquity of neon signage along Route 66 in New Mexico (where DinéYazhi´ grew up) advertising “Indian jewelry” for sale, but often in stores run by people without any Indigenous ancestry, DinéYazhi´said.And, while this text at the Whitney glows red, they’ve also used vivid yellow neon in the past: At the Honolulu Biennial in 2019, for example, to speak to what DinéYazhi´ describes as the exploitative history of uranium extraction in the country. In the mid-1940s, the US government began mining tens of millions of tons of the yellow ore from Navajo lands to create atomic bombs, around the same time as Indigenous code-talkers (including DinéYazhi´’s grandfather) — whose languages were co-opted for clandestine communications — were coming home from World War II.“One of the reasons why the US armed forces used the Navajo language was because it was mostly spoken within the reservation, and it wasn’t in written form,” they said. “And so I just had this really unsettling feeling, realizing that my traditional language — which I don’t speak — was translated, and is embedded into a history of colonial conquest and warfare.”Showing at the Whitney at all was a complicated decision for DinéYazhi´, who found it “affirming” to their practice as an artist but is critical of the museum as a “settler colonial institution” in New York City, which was formerly the land of the Lenape people, they explained.And though DinéYazhi´ found the curatorial team at the Whitney supportive, they said, they were wary nonetheless after a recent incident. One of their artworks, a banner proclaiming “Defund the Police / Decolonize the Street,” was removed, without warning, from display at the Chehalem Cultural Center in Oregon after the opening of an exhibition there last August, with the organizers citing safety concerns. (The center has since publicly apologized.)Ultimately, DinéYazhi´ chose to be hopeful about the outcome of their decision to include the message without the museum’s knowledge. “As much as I was concerned about what the larger response would be, I also felt that (the Whitney curators) were supportive and understanding of the artistic voice,” they said.The Whitney has said that they will not remove the installation, stating via a spokesperson that it “has long been a place where contemporary artists address timely matters, and the Whitney is committed to being a space for artists’ conversations.”For museumgoers who have not yet visited the piece, DinéYazhi´ said they hope that people choose to “really sit” with all of the work in the Biennial.“I hope they see the complexities of the issues that lie underneath the surface — that they don’t just take a photograph, upload it to social media and move on,” they said. In terms of their own work, those “complexities” extend as far as its position within the museum.“The sign itself reflects off the windows and back into the institution,” they said. “It looks outward toward the sunset. It looks outward toward so-called American progress into the darkness of the west — (toward) settler colonialism expansion, Manifest Destiny, the Oregon Trail, forced migrations. It’s this really complicated history that we as a country still have not dealt with, and that many people are trying to silence and erase.”But DinéYazhi´ hopes that people walk away with a renewed sense of hope, and a call to find a better way forward. “There are ideals that are still alive in our communities, that are within our bodies, that are still worth fighting for and nurturing,” they said. “We are still beautiful, powerful beings that can build loving communities, and can care for one another, beyond our differences.”"

        "text": "Charter jets for tycoons and celebrities, a performance by Rihanna and directions to don “jungle fever” outfits when visiting an animal rescue center — that’s how billionaire Mukesh Ambani is kickstarting big fat Indian wedding celebrations for his son.The head of Indian conglomerate Reliance and Asia’s richest man with a net worth of $114 billion according to Forbes, Ambani is known for never doing a party by halves.The occasion of the moment that has India transfixed is a three-day pre-wedding jamboree for his youngest son Anant Ambani, 28, who is set to marry his long-time girlfriend Radhika Merchant, 29. It begins Friday, will entertain 1,200 guests and takes place in a township in Jamnagar near Reliance’s main oil refinery in the western state of Gujarat.The wedding itself does not take place until July and festivities de facto began on Wednesday when Anant and his bride-to-be hosted a communal dinner for local villagers that served 51,000.In addition to pop and R&B superstar Rihanna, US magician David Blaine will perform and there will also be traditional ceremonies in a temple complex.Anant’s pre-wedding bash is likely to be attended by Bill Gates, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, fellow Indian billionaires Gautam Adani and Kumar Mangalam Birla, as well as many cricketers and Bollywood film stars such as Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the plans who declined to be identified.Also likely to attend is Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, which announced a $8.5 billion merger of its India media assets with Reliance’s on Wednesday.Anant is a director at Reliance’s new energy business and one of Ambani’s three children who are the heirs to his empire. Merchant is a director at India’s Encore Healthcare.Ambani also made headlines with his daughter Isha’s wedding in 2018 which was described by some as a mini-Davos summit. Former U.S. Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among those who hit the dance floor with Bollywood stars back then.Guests to Anant Ambani’s celebrations are set to savor 500 dishes created by around 100 chefs.They will be pampered — hair styling, makeup artists and Indian wear drapists are available but only on a “first come, first serve basis,” according to a planning document provided to invitees and seen by Reuters.They will visit a rescue center that Reliance says is home to more than 2,000 animals and has one of the world’s largest elephant hospitals. The dress code is “jungle fever” with guests advised to wear animal print clothing or Hawaiian shirts.Return charter jet flights from New Delhi and Mumbai are on offer, but guests have been asked to limit themselves to only two luggage items or three suitcases per couple. The document cautions that “if you bring more,” there’s no guarantee it will arrive on the same flight.Guests have also been asked to be reasonable in their expectations for laundry services.“Any clothes given to steam (press) will be returned within 3 hours… expecting or requesting anything quicker than that may not be feasible,” it said."

        "title": "Remember when Katharine Hepburn wore pants and scandalized America?",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "In a man’s world, Katharine Hepburn often wore the pants. The Hollywood leading lady and trailblazer defiantly embraced menswear staples, amid incredible pressure not to, paving the way for comfort-loving, power-dressing women decades on.Who could forget the sleek velvet smoking jacket and pants she wore in “Woman of the Year”? Or that slouchy two-piece she wore while perched atop an armchair, with wrinkled socks, scuffed Oxfords and a devil-may-care attitude, in the pages of Life magazine?But following her own style rules wasn’t always easy for Hepburn, a woman who would be later be revered as one of the greatest screen legends of all time and admired for her gumption. Studio staff hid her slacks backstage to stop her wearing them (she reportedly chose to go pantless until they were returned to her). Media outlets published lengthy articles questioning the Hollywood women who chose to wear men’s clothes. “Trousers for women are incredible, ridiculous and absurd!” Movie Classic magazine quoted Hepburn’s fellow actress Constance Bennett saying of the trend in 1933. “I can’t imagine wearing such atrocities.”The American public was also unsure what to make of Hepburn strutting around in pants in the 1930s, before the practicalities of World War II would make them more commonplace among women. “Hepburn’s on- and offscreen choices left many critics and much of the public suspicious, even hostile,” wrote Hollywood historian William J. Mann in his 2006 biography of the star “Kate: The Woman Who Was Hepburn.”In 1934, Hepburn fled to Paris with her friend Susan Steell. As Mann tells it, critics at the time were ripping apart her latest film “Spitfire” and her Broadway performance in “The Lake.” People also felt alienated by her “eccentric approach to gender, sexuality, and stardom,” he wrote.Before that pivotal trip, Hepburn would dress in old clothes, wear no makeup and refuse to let publicists link her romantically with men (she lived with a woman, fueling rumors she was lesbian). She even spoke out about politics, supporting Upton Sinclair, a socialist Democratic nominee in the 1934 California governor’s race, and facing accusations of holding communist beliefs. “Then there were her movies — edgy and offbeat, glimpses of an alternative world where unmarried women held the upper hand,” continued Mann.Take the 1933 romantic drama “Christopher Strong,” in which Hepburn’s pants-wearing character, aviator Lady Cynthia Darrington, has an affair with a married man. The film’s message seemed to renounce the idea of marriage entirely, with the neglected wife of Darrington’s lover (played by actress Billie Burke) saying: “Marriage and children make almost any woman old-fashioned and intolerant.”“What’s fascinating,” Mann wrote of Hepburn, “is that this figure, reviled as subversive in so many ways, could be transformed — as the years passed — into a national heroine.” She would go on to win four Best Actress Oscars for “Morning Glory” in 1933, “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” in 1967, “The Lion in Winter” in 1968, and “On Golden Pond” in 1981, carefully crafting a persona along the way.She turned herself into “a symbol of true-blue, red-blooded Americana because she had to if she was to survive and prosper,” wrote Mann.Hepburn’s style was part of that story.One of her greatest allies in crafting a new public image was Gilbert Adrian, chief costume designer at MGM from 1924 to 1941, who put Hepburn in that iconic goddess gown in “The Philadelphia Story” that has since inspired similar looks for the likes of Jane Fonda, Halle Berry and Cate Blanchett.Adrian is also the man who — seeing how ahead of the times Hepburn was — backed her personal style and preference for pants by translating it onto the silver screen. A woman in menswear was still a rare occurrence, despite stars like Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich also blazing the way, according to fashion historian Kimberly Truhler.“It is not too much of an overstatement to say that ‘The Philadelphia Story’ is revolutionary in its costume design,” Truhler wrote on her fashion history blog GlamAmor in 2014. “It features not one, but two examples of menswear… three if you include her equestrian ensemble as well. All of these outfits essentially open the movie, too, which was unprecedented… (Hepburn’s) desire to wear pants, particularly in the opening scene of this film, was objected to by both producer Joseph Mankiewicz and Louis B. Mayer. But her arrangement with MGM allowed a tremendous amount of control, and she literally showed them who wore the pants in their relationship.”That velvet smoking jacket? That was also Adrian. Truhler said it would later influence the likes of Yves Saint Laurent, whose Fall-Winter 1966 collection introduced the iconic ladies’ tuxedo that he would continue including in all his collections until 2002.Hepburn’s pant-led outfits have remained in the annals of style, making her pairing of blue jeans or high-waisted slacks with button-down shirts a quintessential “American look.” And if the ubiquity of trousers today is anything to go by, her legacy stretches far beyond the silver screen."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Celebrated architect Norman Foster has unveiled plans for a new $1-billion office tower in ﻿Los Angeles that will see greenery spilling out from a series of terraces spiraling up its facade.The eye-catching proposal, which was formally submitted to city planning authorities this week, will transform a two-acre site on Hollywood’s Sunset Boulevard into a 22-story entertainment industry workplace dubbed The Star.Digital impressions of the high-rise, released by the British architect’s firm Foster + Partners on Wednesday, show elevated gardens bursting with plants and trees, as well as outdoor decks and modern office space.In a statement, Foster described it as a “true reflection of the workplace of the future, nurturing community, wellbeing and collaboration.”Comprised largely of offices and billed as “a modern landmark,” The Star will house entertainment firms and “Hollywood’s top content creators,” said Foster + Partners. Current plans include production space, a gallery, a screening theater, a rooftop restaurant and “community gathering spaces” at ground level.The proposal, which is set across 525,000 square feet of floor space, replaces an earlier plan for the site unveiled in 2019. Designed by MAD Architects, the Chinese firm behind the curvilinear Lucas Museum of Narrative Art (which is set to open in LA next year), the original circular design featured a funicular railway wrapping around the exterior.The scheme was reportedly set to cost $500 million, half the price of the new proposal. Asked why the tower’s developer, Maggie Gong Miracle, abandoned the original plan, a spokesperson for the project told CNN that Foster’s new design — which is the same height, but thinner than the previous proposal — was intended to be an “asset to the community” that “respected the views” enjoyed by those living in the Hollywood Hills, which overlook the site.The announcement comes as LA’s real estate market struggles to recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hollywood writers strikes and the growth of remote and hybrid working. More than a quarter of the city’s office space — rising to almost 30% in downtown LA — is currently vacant, according to the latest data from property brokerage Savills.Should the city greenlight the proposal, construction on The Star will start by early 2026 and complete in 2029."

        "text": "Basketball legend Michael Jordan won six NBA championships during his prolific sporting career — and a set of the six sneakers he wore when clinching those titles has sold for a record-breaking $8 million at auction.Friday’s winning bid for “The Dynasty Collection” reached $8,032,800, setting a new global auction record for game-worn sneakers, according to auction house Sotheby’s.The set consisted of Air Jordan VI (1991), Air Jordan VII (1992), Air Jordan VIII (1993), Air Jordan XI (1996), Air Jordan XII (1997), and Air Jordan XIV (1998).“This set represents the most valuable and significant collection of Air Jordan sneakers ever brought to market,” the auction house said on its website ahead of the auction.Notably, only one of each pair was sold.Before the 1991 NBA Finals, Tim Halland, executive director of PR for the Chicago Bulls, requested that Jordan give him one of his game-worn Air Jordan trainers if the team were victorious. Jordan, having won, fulfilled this request, signing and inscribing the shoe before gifting it to Halland – and, due to superstition, continued this tradition for the other five championships, according to Sotheby’s, who obtained the sneakers from a Private American Collector that had obtained them from Halland.The auction lot included a set of signed limited photographs depicting a smiling Jordan wearing just one sneaker following the triumphant NBA Finals.The gap between Jordan’s first three consecutive championships and his last three was due to a brief exit he made from the game of basketball in pursuit of professional baseball in October 1993. Although, by March 1995, he had made a stylish return – leading the Chicago Bulls to the most successful regular season in NBA history with 72 wins.An exceptional player, Jordan earned the nickname “Air Jordan” because of his incredible leaping ability and acrobatic maneuvers.The Air Jordan line has been coveted by sneakerheads ever since the ex-Bulls star wore them in his rookie year – with a buoyant resale market for his range.These sneakers are not the first to have sold for a staggering sum.Last year, a a pair of Jordan’s iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s – the kind he wore to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship in 1988 – sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby’s in New York.In October 2021, a pair of red and white Nike Air Ships sneakers, the type worn by Jordan during his fifth NBA game in his rookie season with the Bulls on November 1, 1984, sold for $1.47 million at auction."

        "title": "Photo of a man posing with a Coca-Cola bottle in 1981 symbolized a cultural shift in China",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A young man stands grinning in Beijing’s Forbidden City. It’s the dead of winter, and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill. The other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass Coca-Cola bottle.Today, Coke is the world’s most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere. But back in 1981, when the image was shot by Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer Liu Heung Shing, it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary Chinese people.Liu, who was in his late 20s when he began working for Time magazine in Beijing, felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.“The changes (at first) were subtle, and unless you lived there, you wouldn’t have noticed,” he recalled during an interview at his home in Hong Kong.He had earlier photographed people grieving for Mao along the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou. It was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late-1950s China, where he grew up during the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign — a series of failed industrialization policies — before moving back to Hong Kong as a child.Under Mao, the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty, and the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. But in the aftermath of the Chinese leader’s death, Liu said, “suddenly, people’s steps looked a little bit lighter, they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed.”It would prove to be a relatively liberal period in Chinese history — politically, economically and in terms of everyday life, which Liu captured in candid shots. One photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure. Another depicted people gathering at a “Democracy Wall” in Beijing, where they wrote now-unthinkable criticisms of the government.One of Liu’s most iconic images was captured on his way into the Time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was “missing.” He turned his car around and, sure enough, a large portrait of Mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down. He quickly shot images of workers gathered around the depiction of the late Chairman, with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame.This was China “moving out of the shadow of Mao,” he said.In December 1978, Coca-Cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland Chinese market since the communist revolution. That same month, Beijing and Washington announced the normalization of Sino-American relations and Deng Xiaoping kick-started China’s transformative economic reforms with his “Open Door” policy. (Coca-Cola was first introduced to China in the 1920s but had been forced to leave in 1949, along with other foreign companies, by a government that regarded it as bourgeois).Liu had photographed the opening of a joint-venture bottling plant in Beijing, capturing Coke chairman Roberto Goizueta and Chinese trade officials drinking Coca Cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of “ganbei” (cheers). He then thought to himself, “Now where do I find a (regular) Chinese person enjoying this (drink)?”He headed to the Forbidden City, with its heavy flow of tourists, and soon found a man named Zhang Wei purchasing a Coke from a small stand.“I remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy Coke: ‘It tastes so-so’” said Liu, who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace’s picturesque pavilions in the background.The response to Coke itself may have been underwhelming, but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many Chinese people felt at the time.“As a photographer, I of course realized the significance. That this man, dressed in a ubiquitous PLA (People’s Liberation Army) coat, was one of the very first people to taste it,” he said, adding: “But I didn’t realize it would become part of the Chinese collective memory.”The image would be widely published and displayed in the following years, and he later became friends with Zhang. In 1983, it appeared in Liu’s photography book “China after Mao,” a collection of images taken between 1976 and 1982. More recently he included it in his book “Liu Heung Shing: A Life in a Sea of Red.”The photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country’s modern history, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. And just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy, Liu’s Coca-Cola photograph feels part of another era altogether.With its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign — ideas encapsulated in that most American of drinks — the image stands in stark contrast to today’s China, where relations with the US are at an all-time low. Xi Jinping’s nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the West.“I realized that the story I did in the last quarter of the 20th century (would) continue to carry relevance into the 21st century,” Liu said.“Especially with the story of China, I never doubt that these photographs are in the Chinese people’s collective memory.“Even though this memory keeps being re-edited… the good thing about a photograph, is you cannot re-edit it. It becomes an image seared in people’s minds.”Top image: A 1981 photograph of a man with a Coke bottle in Beijing’s Forbidden City, shot by Liu Heung Shing."

        "title": "How this photographer makes sublime landscapes of the American West",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "The first time Reuben Wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast, open skies of the American West, he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus.The British visual artist, now based in Chicago, has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting, enhancing craggy peaks with halos, or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity. But for a long time, art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth-pop band Ladytron.“(Photography) started as an all-consuming hobby,” he explained in a phone interview. But when Ladytron took a break in 2011 after five studio albums (they released a self-titled sixth album in 2019, and the seventh, “Time’s Arrow,” this month), he began a new career from scratch. “While the others did their own solo projects, making their own music and releasing their own albums, this was my solo project.”Wu’s imagery takes a classic photographer’s combination — light and landscape — and marries the two in transformative ways. He often begins with dusky evening light or the ink-black shadows of night, then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom-built consumer drones. In one image, a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky. In a different motion piece, Wu simulated an electrical storm in Goblin Valley, Utah, but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning.The artist’s 2018 photo book “Lux Noctis” is in the collections of the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and he has shot commercial work for Apple, Audi and Google as well as the DJ and music producer Zedd. Last summer, Wu revealed a colossal project for National Geographic: a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about Stonehenge, which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones. In November, one of his NFTs, a 4K video loop titled “An Irresistible Force,” outperformed its high estimate by over 25% during an auction at Sotheby’s Hong Kong, selling at 441,000 HKD (about $56,500).“I couldn’t have dreamed of where I am now,” Wu said. “I just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography.”Wu has always been drawn to wild, remote places where he could find solitude. His parents immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK before he was born, and he grew up an introverted child in Liverpool, he said, who didn’t quite click with school. He was fascinated with science-fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday, such as Steven Spielberg’s “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” which featured Wyoming’s Devils Tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact. (Unfamiliar with American topography, he initially thought the butte, a national monument, was a fictional geological entity, he explained with a laugh).The film’s visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work. “(It’s) cemented into my brain, the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky, kind of like search lights on very ordinary (American) landscapes,” he said.He embarked on his first cross-country photography trip across the US in 2013, around a decade after getting a taste on the road with Ladytron. The resulting series featured vivid depictions of the Grand Canyon and South Dakota Badlands, as well as a time-lapse image of Devils Tower at night among star trails.Two years later, Wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot.“I flew the drone up above some cliffs, and I was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape,” he explained. It made the cliffs glow, reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially.Wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project. The first iteration, he said, which he used when the technology was still nascent, was a “massive” eight-rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time. The next used a 3D-printed bracket with an LED hot light, but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air. The tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room, with a half hour to fly out, capture images and return to him, but he’s had to learn to work within the bounds of each set-up.“I’m a lot less anxious now, because I’ve crashed a number of drones,” he said. “And in the end, they’re just tools.”After developing series of still images such as “Lux Noctis” and “Aeroglyphs,” which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies, Wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music. He began creating 15-second video loops from his images, showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky, to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced.“These (works) were very much experimental and had no end goal — they were just things that I did for love out of love,” he said. “I couldn’t license them, I couldn’t print them… and so they were just there, stacking likes on my Instagram.”But in January 2021, Wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to NFT art. He minted his first “non-fungible token” on the marketplace Foundation two months later — an “aeroglyph” of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff. It sold for 30 ETH ($45,000), a portion of which he donated to the National Parks Conservation Association and the AAPI Community Fund. Later that year, the web3 arts organization Obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled “Aeroglyph Variations,” which took him into the New Mexico badlands for a 20-hour shoot that resulted in 55 images of the same setting, each with different lighting conditions and patterns. Wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways, from animations, to AR experiences, to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints.“It’s very much a hybrid medium, and so I’d like to expand that horizon even more, and think about the end goal for my work,” he said. “Am I creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate, or am I creating an experience for people to share?”Wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes, but no matter the medium, his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent.“A lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly — that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work,” he said. “But I’m not trying to create an alien-looking image; I’m trying to show that this is our planet. And there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective.”"

        "category": "style",
        "text": "For over 140 years, Lyle’s Golden Syrup — a staple item in any British baker’s pantry — has featured a rather curious logo on its tin: a lion’s carcass surrounded by bees. But now, for the first time since the 1880s, the product recognized by Guinness World Records for having the world’s oldest branding and packaging is undergoing a major redesign.The company said its new visual identity was designed to “refresh the brand’s legacy to appeal to a 21st century audience.”Golden syrup, also known as light treacle, is a sweet, amber-colored syrup made from refined sugar that was first produced by Abram Lyle & Sons in 1881. The company’s founder, the Scottish businessman Abram Lyle, chose a logo inspired by the story of Samson who, in the Old Testament, kills a lion with his bare hands only to later discover that honeybees have nestled in the animal’s carcass.In the biblical tale, part of the Book of Judges, Samson eats honey from inside the lion, gives some to his parents and then presents 30 wedding guests with a riddle alluding to the encounter: “Out of the eater came something to eat; out of the strong came something sweet.”An alternative wording of the riddle, “Out of the strong came forth sweetness,” has featured on Lyle’s logo since its inception.The new logo, meanwhile, gives the animal a more abstracted — and somewhat more animated — appearance. Just a single bee remains, located slightly above the lion’s head.Acknowledging the product’s unchanged branding in 2006, Guinness World Records noted that the only alterations made since 1885 were “slight technical changes during the war due to shortages of materials.” In 2008, to mark the product’s 125th anniversary, then-owner Tate & Lyle announced that it was changing the tin to a gold color, although the logo remained unchanged.Tate & Lyle was formed in the 1920s when Lyle’s firm merged with rival sugar refinery Henry Tate & Sons. The company, now a major global food and beverage supplier, sold its sugar refining business (including Lyle’s Golden Syrup) to US firm American Sugar Refining, or ASR Group, in 2010.The product’s old logo will continue to be used on Lyle’s classic golden syrup tin, though its bottles and dessert toppings will all now bear the new branding. A company spokesperson declined to comment on whether this represents a majority of the units sold.In a statement, brand director for Lyle’s Golden Syrup, James Whiteley, said that “consumers need to see brands moving with the times and meeting their current need.”“Our fresh, contemporary design brings Lyle’s into the modern day, appealing to the everyday British household while still feeling nostalgic and authentically Lyle’s,” he added. Still, the redesign was met with mixed reactions. On Instagram, designer Laura Evans described the new logo as “contemporary and clever.” She added: “It cuts the fuss and gets straight to the point, whilst retaining the core essence and magic. It says more about the product’s texture and feel than the etched lion surrounded by bees did.”Others however, including several Christian commentators, were less complimentary. “This is what happens when brand managers get involved: take a story that has survived 2000 years and ‘refresh’ it (i.e. ditch it),” author Colin Freeman wrote on X."

        "title": "Pritzker Prize 2024: Japanese housing pioneer Riken Yamamoto wins ‘Nobel of architecture’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "In the Pritzker Prize’s 45-year history, no country has produced more winners than Japan. And on Tuesday, 78-year-old Riken Yamamoto was named the ninth and latest Japanese laureate of an award often dubbed the “Nobel of architecture.”Best-known for innovative housing projects and educational institutions, Yamamoto is something of a surprise choice. But in a press statement announcing the decision, jury chair and former winner Alejandro Aravena described him as “a reassuring architect who brings dignity to everyday life.” He added: “Normality becomes extraordinary. Calmness leads to splendor.”Across a five-decade career, Yamamoto has dedicated himself to fostering community in Japan’s rapidly expanding cities. From housing projects that coax residents into spontaneous interactions to a glass-walled fire station that invites passersby to peer inside, his architecture appears intent on “blurring boundaries between its public and private dimensions,” a jury citation added.As such, Yamamoto has more in common with other recent winners of the Pritzker Prize — an award that increasingly favors socially-minded architects over the creators of iconic landmarks — than with the Japanese laureates of eras past.It is a point of difference tracing back to the early 1970s: While many of his avant-garde compatriots (most notably 1987 Pritzker laureate Kenzo Tange) advocated conceptual floating cities and grand “megastructures,” Yamamoto was driving across the continents with his mentor to see how people lived in villages around the world. Speaking to CNN ahead of Tuesday’s announcement, he described these formative journeys as “my starting point as an architect.”What Yamamoto found, whether in north Africa or central America, was that human societies were traditionally built around a fluid threshold between private and shared spaces — between villages and the households within them. In modern metropolises, however, this divide has become entrenched to the detriment of their inhabitants, he said.“In the city, we have very few communities — sometimes no community,” Yamamoto said on a video call from Yokohama, near Tokyo, where he founded his architecture firm more than 50 years ago.Social isolation is a concern for both architecture and urban planning. Yamamoto said that cities’ preference for zoning, which governs how land is used, often keeps daily life and commercial activity apart; soaring residential towers (or “tower mansions” as he called them, using a direct but fitting translation of the Japanese term for high-rise condos) meanwhile reinforce what he called the “one family, one house” system.“You can sometimes have 5,000 people living completely independently from the city, and the people inside (tower blocks) are independent of each other… most Japanese people believe this is the ideal living system. I don’t agree with that.”Yamamoto’s solution has been housing that encourages neighbors and the public to come together — a form of architectural intervention that “suggests rather than imposes,” as the Pritzker Prize jury put it.After designing a succession of private homes in his early career, Yamamoto completed his first social housing project, in the coastal city of Kumamoto, in 1991. Hoping to inspire a sense of openness, he arranged its 110 homes into 16 clusters around a tree-lined central courtyard. The central public space has no gates and can only be reached by passing through the housing blocks, a scheme designed to increase the likelihood of chance encounters.Elsewhere, the Shinonome Canal Court project in Tokyo saw Yamamoto connect six huge residential blocks with a second-floor deck comprising terraces and shared green spaces. Pangyo Housing in Seongnam, South Korea (which is among a handful of projects the architect completed outside Japan) also linked homes via communal decks, though the development boasted an altogether more radical design feature: glass walls on the ground level of each residence invited neighbors to look inside one another’s houses.Yamamoto acknowledged this could be seen as an afront to privacy. And, at first, residents felt like they were living in a “fishbowl,” the architect recalled. But over time, they warmed to the idea.“It became very popular, and people liked it … sometimes they use (the ground-floor space) as a gallery. Sometimes it’s the guest room. Sometimes it’s a place to drink and sometimes people gather there,” he said, adding that residents subsequently invited him to a community party at the complex. “I was really, really happy at that moment, because they agreed with my design.”The idea of transparency has informed much of Yamamoto’s oeuvre — and not only housing. The clear glass facade, walls and floors of the fire station he designed in Hiroshima offer pedestrians a rare glimpse inside an institution that, while publicly funded, often hides its inner workings. At the Saitama Prefectural University and Future University (in Koshigaya and Hakodate, respectively), soaring windows provide unobstructed views between classrooms and even departments in the hope of stimulating academic collaboration.If Yamamoto’s civic gestures sound like simple solutions to urban ills, maybe that’s because — by his own reckoning — they are: “It’s very easy to make a community space and public space,” he said, framing his ethos as a return to the way public space operated in medieval Europe or Edo-period Japan.And yet, politics and profit have sometimes stood in the way. Yamamoto expressed dismay that more than 30 years after completing his aforementioned housing project in Kumamoto, his vision of shops and cafes occupying its lower reaches has not yet come to fruition due to local zoning regulations. Perhaps a greater challenge, he added, comes from property developers accustomed to promoting the benefits of standalone private homes.“Of course, political support is very important. But I think developers (should) change their minds a little bit. They believe that ‘one house, one family’ is the best way. I propose to the developer: change the system.”First awarded to American architect Philip Johnson in 1979, the Pritzker Prize recognizes what it describes as architects’ “consistent and significant contributions to humanity and the built environment.”Yamamoto, who has also completed buildings in China and Switzerland, is the latest in a string of laureates recognized for their commitment to the public and civic realms.Last year’s award went to British architect David Chipperfield, who is best-known for cultural institutions like Des Moines Public Library in Iowa his reimagined Neues Museum in Berlin. In 2022, Francis Kéré became the first ever African laureate in recognition of a career designing schools, health centers and community facilities.The Japanese architect will be awarded with $100,000 and a bronze medallion."

        "title": "One of London’s top museums wants to hire a Taylor Swift superfan",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Taylor Swift might be saying “So Long, London” in her much-anticipated upcoming album but one of the city’s top museums is offering the dream job for any Swiftie.On Thursday, the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) released a job listing for a Taylor Swift superfan to advise its expert curators and explain her importance to the history of art and design, in which the museum specializes.The successful fan will have the chance to view relevant items from the V&A’s collection of more than 2.8 million objects and potentially help influence the museum’s future programming, it said.They should be able to offer “insights into the culture and artisanry” around the friendship bracelets that Swifties often exchange, as well as the handmade signs frequently displayed at concerts, the V&A told CNN in a statement on Friday.Swapping distinctive friendship bracelets, often featuring the names of Swift songs and albums or the names of the fans themselves, has become one of the rituals associated with attending an “Eras” tour concert.The tradition was inspired by the lyrics of “You’re on Your Own, Kid,” a track from Swift’s 2022 album “Midnights,” as she sings about making friendship bracelets as a way to connect with others over a shared experience.And friendship bracelets play a starring role in the origin story of her relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce. He said in July on his podcast that he had attempted to give Swift a bracelet with his number on it at one of her concerts. She heard about it and got in touch, and the couple started dating, she told Time in December.Artifacts such as these bracelets and the homemade, often ornate, signs that fans take to concerts provide a tangible mark of the economic, cultural and social phenomenon that has been the “Eras” tour, which started in March last year and is due to end in December.The role is part of the V&A’s efforts to “bring in grassroots expertise in highly specific cultural niches” to complement the “vast curatorial knowledge” of the museum’s experts, it said.Beside Swifties, the V&A is also looking for superfans of Crocs, drag, emojis and tufting – a technique used in rug-making – to help inform their exhibitions, asking potential applicants to highlight their own collections.It has already recruited experts in Lego, Pokémon, Gorpcore – a trend in which hiking clothing is worn as an everyday outfit – and Toby jugs, which are made in the shape of a seated person.Tristram Hunt, the museum’s director, said in a statement that the roles will help “discover more about the enormous, and often surprising, creative diversity on offer at the V&A, as well as helping us to learn more about the design stories that are relevant to our audiences today.”The museum did not stipulate a salary for the part-time, zero-hours role but said that it will cover “reasonable” travel costs and that successful candidates will receive a V&A Membership."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "The former London home of rock legend Freddie Mercury is available to buy – that is, for those with a cool £30 million ($38 million) to spare.Garden Lodge in Kensington, west London, was home to the Queen front man for 11 years, and boasts features including a Japanese sitting room, a double height drawing room, a bar/library and a music center.The property was bought by Mercury on the spot when he first visited it in 1980, according to Knight Frank, which is handling the sale.Collaborating with specialist interior architect and designer Robin Moore Ede, Mercury renovated the home over the next decade, using the finest materials and his personal design taste to create what he called his “country house in central London,” Knight Frank said in a press release Monday.The Queen singer designed his home to be a “memorable, inviting place that reflected his vibrant personality and eclectic vision,” the release added.In this spirit, the dining room was painted citrus-yellow, reportedly Mercury’s favorite color, with complementary jewel tones in the cornices of the room.Once home to the grand piano that Mercury used to compose “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the drawing room offers views of the property’s garden, which is adorned with large magnolia trees and “oriental inspired” water features.The property’s principal suite is entered through what used to be Mercury’s dressing room, where he stored his clothes and stage costumes. The room is mirrored from floor to ceiling, with multiple cupboard doors.Upon his death in 1991, Mercury bequeathed the property and all of its possessions to his close friend and confidante, Mary Austin.After more than 30 years taking care of them, Austin, now 72, auctioned about 1,400 of Mercury’s belongings last year, and is now looking to sell Garden Lodge for offers in excess of £30 million ($38 million), according to Knight Frank.“This house has been the most glorious memory box, because it has such love and warmth in every room,” Austin said in the press release.“It has been a joy to live in and I have many wonderful memories here. Now that it is empty, I’m transported back to the first time we viewed it.“Ever since Freddie and I stepped through the fabled green door, it has been a place of peace, a true artist’s house, and now is the time to entrust that sense of peace to the next person,” she added."

        "title": "4,000-year-old vial contains ancient red lipstick, archaeologists say",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A small stone vial discovered in southeastern Iran contained a red cosmetic that was likely used as a lip coloring nearly 4,000 years ago, according to archaeologists.The rare find is “probably the earliest” example of lipstick to be scientifically documented and analyzed, the researchers reported in February in the journal Scientific Reports.More than 80% of the analyzed sample was made up of minerals that produce a deep red color — primarily hematite. The mixture also contained manganite and braunite, which have dark hues, as well as traces of other minerals and waxy substances made from vegetables and other organic substances.“Both the intensity of the red coloring minerals and the waxy substances are, surprisingly enough, fully compatible with recipes for contemporary lipsticks,” the study authors noted.It’s not possible to exclude the possibility the cosmetic was used in other ways, say, as a blusher, according to lead study author Massimo Vidale, an archaeologist at the University of Padua’s Department of Cultural Heritage in Italy. But he said the homogenous, deep red color, the compounds used and the shape of the vial “suggested to us it was used on lips.”It’s one of the first examples of an ancient, red-colored cosmetic to be studied, he said, although it wasn’t clear why cosmetic preparations resembling lipstick were uncommon in the archaeological record.“We have no idea, for the moment. The deep red color we found is the first one we met, while several lighter-colored foundations and eye shadows had been identified before,” he said via email.The use of hematite — crushed red ocher — had been documented on stone cosmetic palettes from the late Neolithic, as well as in ancient Egyptian cosmetic vessels, according to Joann Fletcher, a professor in the University of York’s department of archaeology. Whether the vial from Iran was the earliest lipstick, “all comes down to what this new discovery was actually used for,” she said.“It is possible the contents of the vial were used as a lip colour. But they could also have been applied to give colour to the cheeks, or for some other purpose, even if the vial looks like a modern lipstick tube,” said Fletcher, who was not involved in the research, in an email.It is “very plausible” the artifact was a lipstick, said Laurence Totelin, a professor of ancient history in the School of History, Archaeology and Religion at Cardiff University specializing in Greek and Roman science, technology, and medicine.“As the authors point out, the recipe is not dissimilar to a modern one. The deep red colour is also what we would expect for lip make up,” said Totelin, who was not involved in the study, via email.“That said, the ingredients are also regularly found in the preparation of ancient medicines, and the vial has a shape that is not inconsistent with a pharmaceutical use,” Totelin said.Other products previously unearthed in Egypt and the Middle East and studied by archaeologists have included black kohl eyeliners and lighter-colored compounds used as eye shadows or foundations. Unlike other ancient cosmetics, the vial’s concoction had a low lead content. This low level, the researchers suggested, might mean the lipstick’s makers understood the dangers of consuming lead, a naturally occurring toxic metal that can cause numerous health problems.“There is a long and harsh debate among experts on the toxicity of lead compounds in cosmetics,” Vidale said.Earlier research on artifacts from the same region that Vidale was involved with “suggests that 5,000 years ago white lead was the base material for facial foundations, meanwhile the content of our deep red preparation, supposedly meant for lips, was almost lead-free. It might have been a conscious choice,” he said.The preparation contained quartz particles, from ground sand or crystal, perhaps added, the study suggested, as a ”shimmery-glittering agent” — although it was possible they came from the inside of the vial itself, which was finely crafted from a greenish stone called chlorite.It’s also not clear what the original consistency of the cosmetic would have been — a fluid or more solid, Vidale said.“The vial’s slender shape and limited thickness suggest that it could have been conveniently held in one hand together with the handle of a copper/bronze mirror, leaving the other hand free to use a brush or another kind of applicator,” the study authors wrote, citing an ancient Egyptian papyrus dated to the 12th century BC that depicts a young woman painting her lips in such a way as an example.The artifact was among thousands of items unearthed from Bronze Age tombs and graves in the Jiroft region of Iran. The graves — part of an ancient kingdom known as Marhasi — were exposed and dislodged in 2001 when a river flooded, after which their precious contents were looted and sold by locals. Many stone and copper items, including the vial, were subsequently recovered by Iranian security forces.The vial is kept in the National Archaeological Museum of Jiroft, where the team took samples.“Like a bolt out of the blue, this civilization was discovered … when a disastrous flood hit its ancient cemeteries, exposing all kinds of archaeological treasures,” Vidale said.“Now the region is well protected, but serious damages were done,” he added. “What we know today is that this was an advanced Mesopotamian-like civilization, a major player in long-distance trade and military ventures, which used its own writing system and was ruled by large cities and powerful, authoritative rulers. The rest is slowly emerging from new excavations.”It’s not clear who would have worn the lipstick — or in what context. “As far as we know, cosmetics were regularly deposited near the face of the deceased in the graves of the time,” Vidale said.However, given the looting and destruction of the graves, researchers have not been able to link the artifact with specific human remains."

        "title": "The woman who helps actors get into character — in a very unconventional way",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "When Helena Bonham Carter walked onto the set of 2012’s Dark Shadows movie, she was stinking of bourbon whiskey and Gauloises cigarettes.Her character was a chain-smoking alcoholic psychiatrist, but Bonham Carter hadn’t gone “method”; she had simply spritzed herself with a bespoke fragrance created specifically for her by fragrance designer Azzi Glasser.Having met by chance at their children’s school gates in London, the two have collaborated on countless projects over the years, beginning with the 2009 period drama “Enid,” for which Glasser concocted a perfume that evoked “stale white face powder that immediately took me back to the 1950s,” recalled Bonham Carter who was playing author Enid Blyton.Glasser has also fashioned a dark blend of foxglove, poison hemlock and belladonna for Bellatrix Lestrange in the “Harry Potter” films, a chocolate chilli-scented fragrance for the Red Queen character in “Alice in Wonderland,” and what Glasser describes as a mixture of “old, cracked soap with a ‘pissy’ note to it” for the role of Miss Havisham in 2012’s “Great Expectations.”“Helena couldn’t wait to get into rehearsals with that one,” said Glasser who is famed for having one of the best ‘noses’ in the business and prides herself on elevating an A-lister’s presence through her visceral scent blends.Born in the UK, Glasser spent her early formative years in India before returning to London. She worked for British fragrance house CPL Aromas for 20 years before creating the iconic Agent Provocateur fragrance in 2000, and in 2016, founded her own brand, The Perfumer’s Story by Azzi. Now, a bespoke fragrance from Glasser can cost up to £15,000 ($19,000), though she also offers a lower-priced collection of fragrances to enable people to discover their own fragrance DNA.Her roster of celebrity clients include actors Alicia Vikander, Noomi Rapace, Damian Lewis, Orlando Bloom, and Stephen Fry, as well as musicians Kylie Minogue and Adam Lambert. But it was Bonham Carter who introduced her “secret perfumer” to a curious Johnny Depp on the set of “Dark Shadows.” Depp promptly instructed Glasser to create a bespoke scent for his own character, a vampire called Barnabas, and they continued to work together. “Azzi possesses a certain sorcery in that she is capable of capturing the perfect essence of a character in scent,” he said of Glasser’s work.The perfumer believes that fragrance helps to truly understand the essence of a character. “We’ll meet up to talk about the role, the styling, who the director is, who the other actors are, the space, atmosphere, where they might be filming, whether it will be cold or hot… There are many elements at play. I’ll then go and start trialing and tweaking (the scent) until it’s absolutely perfect. I have never had anyone say, ‘no, it’s not quite right’,” said Glasser who can spend anything from a week to three months to create a custom-made scent.The result is not always positively fragrant, as with Jude Law’s depiction of an aging, ulcerated Henry VIII in the upcoming movie Firebrand.“I worked with Jude on “The Young Pope.” He came to the studio and told me, ‘I want to smell exactly like Henry.’ I told him, you know it’s going to smell repulsive, right?”The result was a heady brew of smells evoking gout, bad breath and excrement.“It was interesting because the other actors were affected by his presence, this power and manipulative stinkiness, as in real life. Whereas Henry could just (mask his own scent by) sniffing a handkerchief that smelt of rose.”Brad Pitt is on her wish list of collaborators, alongside Julia Roberts and Leonardo DiCaprio, although she has made headway with the latter, she revealed.“I met him at (a London restaurant) recently and he gave me his number,” says Glasser, who will soon be working with Austin Butler following his visit to her studio in north London alongside his model girlfriend Kaia Gerber.But whether she’s mixing a tailored fragrance for an exclusive venue, such as London’s Chiltern Firehouse, or an affluent individual — as she has done for Cindy Crawford (a 50th birthday present from her husband Rande Gerber), and David Linley, son of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones — Glasser approaches each scent as an entirely new landscape.“David called it a fun therapy session,” she laughs. “But it is learning about the person, or history, the character, style and so on,” said Glasser who called fragrance “the love of my life.”But it’s Hollywood’s A-listers who seem to benefit the most from a one-of-a-kind aroma.“As actors know, fragrance can transform you and take you on a journey. It opens up passages and doors in the brain, working through the olfactory system to bring out emotions,” noted Glasser. “It can make you feel more confident, powerful, desirable and assertive, and affect how others react to you. Essentially, scent tells a story.”"

        "title": "‘My beliefs haven’t changed’: From social housing to skyscrapers, architect Moshe Safdie is still an idealist",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "There are few buildings that have more drastically shaped a city’s image than Marina Bay Sands. Just as the Eiffel Tower and Burj Khalifa define the skylines of Paris and Dubai, the soaring three-tower resort, joined across the top by a horizontal “skypark” and the world’s most famous infinity pool, is an icon both in and of Singapore.In fact, the hotel-casino project is so successful that the man who designed it doesn’t even stay there.“It’s too noisy,” said Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. “I’m a swimmer and I can never get in the pool because there are so many people taking pictures.”Now resuming his once-frequent trips to Singapore amid easing travel restrictions, Safdie prefers the nearby Ritz-Carlton, where we meet for afternoon tea. (“I had a British mother,” he explained, “so I’m a sucker for scones and tea.”) At a top-floor table overlooking his best-known creation, he reflected on the sometimes-fraught task of designing contemporary landmarks.“It wasn’t on my mind as much as it was on their minds,” he clarified, recounting the call for design proposals issued by the city-state’s government in the mid-2000s. “They didn’t quite say the building should become the icon of Singapore, but they talked about it being iconic.“When we made the submission, I said, ‘Some buildings have the magic to become memorable and associated with a place.’ And I mentioned Sydney Opera House as the classic contemporary example. But, I said, ‘It’s a mystery what makes that happen.’”The trick, it transpired, was designing something striking yet simple. Constructing a 0.2-mile-long cantilevered roof terrace atop three skyscrapers required a feat of complex engineering but, at its most abstract, Marina Bay Sands can be sketched in four basic strokes. In Singapore Sign Language, the landmark is referenced by simply raising three fingers of one hand and resting another digit across the top. Visible for miles around, it appears on postcards and newscast backdrops. The structure also stars in the official Singapore Lego set, which the architect proudly displays at his office back in Somerville, Massachusetts.“That kind of stuff, you can’t quite plan for or design – it just happens,” he said of the building’s success. “But I’m very happy about it. It changed our lives in terms of the work we get.”Safdie’s eponymous firm is in high demand. In the years since Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010, he has realized almost 20 major projects. Among them are the serene Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas and a dual-tower residential complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka, that sees one high-rise lean dramatically against the other. The architect also bequeathed Singapore with another landmark in 2019: Jewel, a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex that attracts throngs of Instagrammers to Changi Airport each day thanks to its verdant indoor waterfall.Safdie has said he considers seeing finished projects in use to be among an architect’s greatest pleasures. He makes a point of visiting Jewel whenever he’s in Singapore. “I was concerned about how the plants were doing,” he said. “But I was relieved to see they’re thriving.”The architect is not in Singapore to indulge in past glories, however. In the days after our interview, he will inspect two new developments: a gardenesque office complex in the island’s west and a pair of residential towers on the upmarket Orchard Road. The latter features multiple skybridges – a recurring theme in Safdie’s work that was recently taken to new extremes in Chongqing, China, where he lay a gargantuan “horizontal skyscraper” (containing an infinity pool, restaurants and an indoor garden) atop four 820-foot-tall towers.Then there is the small matter of Marina Bay Sands’ second phase. The expansion plans feature, among other things, a fourth tower – though Safdie dismissed early suggestions that his iconic skypark might be extended to rest across its top. In any case, Singapore officials have expressed that he shouldn’t, in his words, “screw around” with an icon.Instead, the new tower will stand apart from the other three, forming “sort of an exclamation mark,” he explained, motioning punctuative strokes: “Boooom… boom.”At 84, Safdie shows little sign of slowing down. Other recent trips have taken him to Sao Paolo, Brazil, where his glass-roofed Albert Einstein Education and Research Center recently opened its doors, and to the Ecuadorian capital Quito, where his tree-covered Qorner Tower will do so later this year. Covid-19 eased the architect’s unrelenting travel schedule, but he used the downtime to pen a memoir, “If Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.” He said he felt it was “time to document things.”Published this week, “If Walls Could Speak” serves as a reminder that much of Safdie’s six-decade career has been dedicated to humbler pursuits – museums, memorials and social housing that reimagined how people might live in densely populated cities.Before Marina Bay Sands, his best-known project was his very first: Habitat 67, a radical 1960s housing development that saw hundreds of identical prefabricated concrete units stacked into clusters along Montreal’s Saint Lawrence River. Safdie’s dream that it would spark a wave of large-scale “Habitats” around the world proved overly optimistic. His attempts to repeat the feat in other cities, including New York, Toronto and Iran’s capital Tehran, have often been thwarted. Projects of such size require land, funding and political will, and Safdie’s book openly recounts times when all three were lacking.But the principles underpinning the experiment – that apartment dwellers should enjoy access to outdoor space, views in multiple directions and the opportunity to interact with nature and neighbors – defined his work thereafter.Born in 1938 in Haifa, then part of British-controlled Palestine, Safdie has credited much of this architectural ethos to his childhood. As a boy, he always lived in apartment buildings, first in a Bauhaus-style block on Haifa’s Mount Carmel and then at his family’s new home further up the hill. At the latter, he would enter via a bridge, while the famous Baha’i Gardens “almost functioned as my backyard,” he writes in “If Walls Could Speak.” One need not look far for the inspiration behind the skybridges and elevated urban gardens that have since characterized his oeuvre.Safdie moved to Canada with his parents aged 15. (In a neat turn of events, he departed Israel via Lod Airport, since renamed Ben Gurion Airport, where decades later he would design a terminal building.) It was in Montreal that Safdie decided to pursue architecture – and where he first grew his signature mustache. He attended the city’s McGill University and wrote a college thesis, “A Case for City Living,” outlining his vision for a flexible housing “system” that could be adapted to different contexts and climates.Those early ideas have long shaped Safdie’s outlook. They would shape his fortunes, too. After showing his college drawings to the influential modernist Louis Kahn, he secured an apprenticeship at the architect’s Philadelphia office. Soon after, he was offered the chance to put his ideas into practice at a scale unimaginable to most young graduates.Montreal was due to host the 1967 World Fair, or Expo 67. Despite having never completed a building, the then 24-year-old Safdie was asked by the event’s mastermind (and his thesis adviser), architect Sandy van Ginkel, to develop a master plan for the site. He was also tasked with building on his ideas, eventually proposing a village-sized development of some 1,200 prefabricated dwellings stacked 20 to 30 stories high. His meticulous placement of each factory-built module was calculated to maximize garden space, allow in sunlight and improve residents’ views. Interconnected pedestrian walkways and bridges lifted the urban realm above ground.Political and financial realities scaled back his design; the final Habitat 67 comprised just 154 apartments – made from 354 modules and stacked 12 stories high across three “clusters.” It was, nonetheless, a major statement. In a postwar world rethinking how to accommodate rapidly urbanizing populations, Safdie’s system of repeated modular forms offered a bold new model for housing. Three of the 20th century’s most important architects, I.M. Pei, Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson, toured the project together prior to its opening. Only when Johnson told Safdie that he had “outdone” the classical Italian architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi did he realize the project “was a game changer,” he recounted.Habitat 67 was not universally adored. A New Yorker cartoon, which Safdie also displays at his Boston office, poked “gentle fun” at the project by depicting a spade-wielding child stacking sand into similar formations. Various journalists and fellow architects were more barbed in their criticisms.“It’s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it,” Safdie mused. “But that’s been true of my career.”To define Safdie’s career by either his breakout success or the “megascale” projects of recent years would be to ignore much else in between.In the early 1970s, he opened an office in Jerusalem, a city whose urban fabric he has profoundly transformed. As well as designing major institutions like the Hebrew Union College and the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, he oversaw a full-scale rebuild of the destroyed Jewish Quarter and planned an entirely new city, Modi’in-Maccabim-Re’ut, about 15 miles to its northwest. At one point, he even considered running for mayor of Jerusalem.He has also built widely in North America, where his output spans from the meditative (a nondenominational chapel at the Harvard Business School) to the mammoth (Terminal 1 of Toronto’s Pearson Airport). A citizen of Israel, the US and Canada, Safdie may be best known in the latter for the National Gallery in Ottawa, a grand glass palace housing some of the country’s most treasured art.Despite earlier setbacks Safdie has, more recently, found fertile ground for his “Habitats” in Asia. In 2017, he completed the first phase of the sprawling Habitat Qinhuangdao – in the titular city, about 200 miles from Beijing – a series of 16-story “mini blocks” connected by garden bridges. Back in Singapore, Safdie’s pixelated Sky Habitat tower saw him stretch his familiar stacked forms high above the ground to maximize floor space on a comparatively small plot.In both cases – and throughout Safdie’s career – ideals articulated in the 1960s have been adapted to meet the realities of new sites and clients. Yet, the architect maintains that his approach to housing remains, fundamentally, the same.“The belief in apartments being rethought as houses, in having gardens for every apartment, in quality of life, in streets and communities and making buildings that belong to their culture – from the outset these were fundamental to my beliefs,” he said. “And they haven’t changed. If anything, they have reinforced themselves as years go by.”“I think, without bragging, there’s been consistency,” he added. “In fact, you could say I’ve not been dynamic enough, but I’ve been pretty consistent.”There were other high-profile proposals that never came to fruition. Among the most divisive was the Columbus Center, a pair of heavy-set towers once set to loom over Manhattan’s Central Park at Columbus Circle before plans were scrapped following 1987’s Wall Street crash (and amid vociferous criticism from the likes of Henry Kissinger and Jacqueline Onassis).But Safdie’s legacy will not be measured only by what was, or wasn’t, built. Many of the once-radical ideas he championed are now mainstream – something he can take an amount of credit for. For one, his fixation on plant life, a principle he dubbed “for everyone a garden” in a 1974 book of the same name, is now widely shared by younger architects. Urban gardens and “living walls” are now almost de rigueur for new large-scale developments.Plants do not always thrive, though. In his memoir, Safdie distinguishes between “significant plant life” and “sorry shrubs.” So-called biophilic architecture may now be all the rage, but it can be undone by insufficient planning or maintenance, leaving occupants with dying trees and even bug infestations. As such, Safdie welcomes the trend while cautioning again token gestures.“The idea of green buildings is a battle cry – everyone is for it,” he said. Making them work, however, is another matter altogether. “There’s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then, in the renderings, everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees. When you look (closer), you see there’s no preparation for the earth, there’s no depth – it’s a fantasy.”Prefabrication, championed by the architect since his college thesis, is also enjoying a renaissance. Just two miles away from Marina Bay Sands, for instance, a Singaporean design firm is overseeing two 630-foot-tall residential skyscrapers built from units constructed in a factory over the border in Malaysia.“For a long time, people totally gave up on (prefabrication),” Safdie said. “But now there is a real shortage of labor and skilled labor – not in China, because they’ve got an extraordinary workforce, and not in India, but everywhere else in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, in the West. So, anything that is labor-saving is now up for grabs.”Much else has changed since Safdie formed his architectural ideals. For one, he “never would have imagined” how densely populated cities would become in the past 50 years. “Programs change, lifestyles change, priorities change and technologies change,” the architect added.But what about him? Has his outlook changed, too? “My daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as I was,” the architect said. “I disagree with her.”Safdie is nonetheless aware that the lofty principles of his youth may not be shared by the casinos or corporate clients he often works for. Being an architect sometimes means serving “regimes you’re not in love with and business entities whose values are different to yours,” he noted.“Take the dilemma I had with Marina Bay Sands,” he said, motioning once more toward the window and our view of the complex from the Ritz-Carlton’s lounge. “On the one hand, the idea of doing a building that could promote ‘gaming’ – that’s a nice word for it, but ‘gambling’ is the reality – is almost immoral if you go there and see poor people with limited means wasting their money.“But, to me, that was 2% or 3% of the area of a project that… could show what the public realm could be in a city. And that took over from the issue that nagged me.“That’s compromise,” he concluded. “But the basic value, the idealism of the end product, has not diminished. Without it, I don’t know how you can be an architect.”“If Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture,” published by Grove Atlantic, is available now."

        "title": "Two skyscrapers joined by daring cantilevered ‘skybridge’ to soar over New York",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A pair of skyscrapers connected by a cantilevered “skybridge” and a rooftop infinity pool is set to join the New York City skyline, as developers unveiled a proposal for a new megaproject just south of the United Nations headquarters on Monday.Designed by architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), the 615-foot-tall towers will contain two hotels, while a soaring lobby across the top will house restaurants, bars, an art gallery a glass-floored (and glass-ceilinged) viewing platform and — should a license be granted — a subterranean casino.Along with two new residential towers, the skyscrapers will flank the newly unveiled Freedom Plaza development, a three-block-long public park with retail spaces and a new “Museum of Freedom and Democracy.”The Midtown Manhattan site, which overlooks the East River, is currently occupied by a large-scale art installation “Field of Light,” by British Artist Bruce Munro, that was commissioned by the charitable arm of Soloviev Group, the property developer behind the plan. But the 6.7-acre patch of prime real estate, roughly the size of Madison Square Park, has sat largely unused since the 2000s.Bjarke Ingels, the Danish founder and creative director of BIG, said his firm’s design looks to extend the greenery that architects Le Corbusier, Wallace Harrison and Oscar Niemeyer created at the neighboring UN building.“We continue to build on these architectural principles by uniting three city blocks to form a public green space reaching from 1st Avenue to the East River overlook, creating a green connection all the way to the water’s edge,” said Ingels in a press statement.The two hotel towers are set to host the city’s first five-star Banyan Tree property, as well as a hotel run by casino operator Mohegan. A 150,000-gallon infinity pool will be built on the roof of the connecting skybridge, with BIG describing it as “one of the largest rooftop pools in North America.”The 50- and 60-story residential towers, meanwhile, nod to the modernist New York City buildings of the 1950s and 1960s thanks to their striped glass and aluminum facades. Measuring 550 and 650 feet tall, the two high-rises will be connected by a podium housing a food market and retail space.The development is one of several projects competing for three casino gaming licenses recently approved for downstate New York by the state’s gaming commission. But plans have faced local opposition, with some residents and officials voicing concern about the development. Hoping to entice authorities to grant the license, the Soloviev Group has said it would designate 513, or nearly 40% of the development’s 1,325 apartments as affordable housing should the license come through.“The revenue generated by the project’s entertainment and hospitality component will allow Freedom Plaza to deliver the affordable housing program and expansive publicly accessible green space, with many more details yet to be announced,” said Ray Pineault, CEO and President of Mohegan in a statement last year.Americans are currently living through the toughest housing market in a generation, and New York has been one of the hardest hit locations, with rental vacancy rates down to a multi-decade low of 1.4%, according to the 2023 NYC Housing and Vacancy Survey.Soloviev Group has also promised that an unspecified percentage of the gaming profits, starting with a minimum $5 million donation, will go to an independently run non-profit community fund.Elsewhere on the site, BIG has designed a new “Museum of Freedom and Democracy” that “celebrates the origin and evolution of one of the most impactful inventions of mankind and our continuous struggle to build, maintain and protect the institutions that uphold it,” said Ingels.The Möbius strip-shaped building, overlooking the river, winds on top of itself creating outdoor walking paths. BIG described the design as an homage to the amphitheaters built by the Ancient Greeks, the creators of modern democracy.Unaffiliated with Long Island University’s Museum of Democracy, the new institution will contain pieces of the Berlin Wall and works from the Soloviev Group’s art collection.“Our plan is to develop this site in a way that delivers benefits for the local neighborhood and the city as a whole, worthy of its skyline and waterfront location, and befitting New York City’s key role as a leader in the global cultural economy,” said Michael Hershman, CEO of the Soloviev Group, in a press release.Groundbreaking and completion dates are yet to be announced as the developers await a decision on the project’s casino license but will likely be finished in five to seven years once building works commences.Should the license not be granted, the project will continue, likely based on a previous design approved in 2008, said the developer."

        "title": "French lawmakers approve bill penalizing fast fashion",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "France’s lower house of parliament on Thursday approved a bill seeking penalties on ultra-fast fashion products, sold by companies like China’s Shein, aimed at helping to offset their environmental impact.The bill calls for gradually increasing penalties of up to 10 euros ($11) per individual item of clothing by 2030, as well for a ban on advertising for such products.All voting lawmakers unanimously approved the bill, which will head to the senate before it can become law.The popularity of fashion retailers Shein and Temu — which scale up orders based on demand thanks to ultra-flexible supply chains — have disrupted the retail sector while established players like Zara and H&M continue to largely rely on predicting shoppers’ preferences.“This evolution of the apparel sector towards ephemeral fashion, combining increased volumes and low prices, is influencing consumer buying habits by creating buying impulses and a constant need for renewal, which is not without environmental, social and economic consequences,” the bill said.Shein said in a statement to Reuters that the clothes it produces meet an existing demand, which allows its rate of unsold garments to remain consistently in low single digits, whereas traditional players can have up to 40% waste.It added that the only impact of the bill would be to “worsen the purchasing power of French consumers, at a time when they are already feeling the impact of the cost-of-living crisis.”Writing on X, France’s environment minister, Christophe Béchu, described the bill as a “major step forward,” adding: “A big step has been taken to reduce the textile sector’s environmental footprint.”The bill comes as the French environmental ministry said it would propose a European Union ban on exports of used clothes, in a bid to tackle the worsening problem of textile waste.Last year, the country launched a repair scheme to encourage people to mend old clothes and shoes rather than throw them away. The French government pledged 154 million euros ($168 million) to the initiative, which reimburses shoppers up to 25 euros ($27.20) for every garment they have repaired. The non-profit group tasked with running the scheme, Refashion, says that 3.3 billion items of clothing, household linen and footwear went on the French market in 2022. At the time, the country’s ministry of ecology said that French people throw away 700,000 tons of clothes — two-thirds of which ends up in landfills — each year.Among the world’s most polluting industries, fashion accounts for between 3% and 5% of global carbon emissions, according to consultancy McKinsey’s State of Fashion report. Around half of all fibers produced by the industry are forms of oil-based polyester, the report added."

        "title": "Is it time to revolutionize the toilet?",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Consider the toilet — that humble porcelain bowl that spirits away our waste several times a day. It’s not a piece of technology that often gets flashy updates (though dual flushing, seat warming and electronic bidet features can certainly elevate it), nor is it a darling of the design world.But toilets are in desperate need of an upgrade — as is our entire approach to sewage, according to the many designers, environmental engineers and sanitation experts hoping to bring about a paradigm shift.Flushing our waste is, well, wasteful, accounting for nearly a third of indoor water use in US homes, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In many parts of the world, the use of water toilets has become increasingly fraught as climate change ushers in extreme droughts and flooding, which backs up sewers and overflows septic tanks. In disaster zones, or places without access to running water, the need for innovation is even more urgent.Rethinking how we deal with waste may also present an opportunity: Our excrement can be converted into renewable heat, electricity and fertilizer.“Waste is not waste, it’s a resource,” said Arja Renell, a Finnish artist and architect who brought the topic to last year’s Venice Architecture Biennale as the curator of her country’s pavilion. She wasn’t an expert in the field, but had been alarmed to learn that some of Venice’s wastewater is flushed directly into its canals and wanted to demonstrate a circular approach to sanitation: the “dry” toilet.Known as a “Huussi” in Finnish, the dry toilet separates urine from stool and is ventilated to keep odors out — In Finland, dry toilets are particularly prevalent in rural summer cottages, Renell told CNN in a video call. Users layer the contents of the toilet’s bin with peat or sawdust after doing their business; once full, they move the excrement to a larger airtight container over the course of several months so that any microorganisms die out.The remaining material, rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, can be used as natural fertilizer rather than the usual greenhouse gas-emitting synthetic kind.The dry composting method will be familiar to those with off-grid homes. In the US, dry compost toilets have long been built as alternatives to flush toilets in rural homes that aren’t connected to a sewage system, or by people who can’t afford to install a neutralizing septic tank, which can cost thousands of dollars. Kelsey McWilliams, an environmental engineer who builds circular sanitation systems around the country with her company Point of Shift, said the need for sustainable solutions will only grow in drought- or flood-stricken areas.“There are multiple states right now where people are working on changing the current building codes to allow not only compost toilets, but more innovative solutions for people who want them,” she told CNN. “Septic tanks are great — they served a purpose. They’re a very old type of technology, and they still generally protect our wells from human waste and bacteria. But there are better solutions.”Expanding the use of dry compost toilets poses formidable challenges, however, from state- or county-level regulations right down to personal preferences. They can be difficult to install in urban settings and hard to maintain in anything larger than a single-family home. There’s also the matter of time: Waiting up to a year for waste to be safely recycled will deter many people — and the ick factor may be hard to shake.“It’s asking people to care about something that they’re biologically attuned to be averse to,” McWilliams said.But what if your poo could, for the most part, disappear from your toilet? That’s the question being asked by Change:WATER Labs, a startup led by scientist and entrepreneur Diana Yousef which is patenting an evaporative material that aims to reduce the volume of waste build-up by as much as 97% in a single day.“We have developed a technology that we lovingly term ‘shrink wrap for crap,’” Yousef explained on a phone call.Change:WATER Labs’ low-cost and entirely waterless portable toilet, dubbed the “iThrone,” stores human waste in a pouch lined with the proprietary material. What’s left still needs to be collected and treated — it’s recycable, but not neutralized — but only needs to be retrieved once every one to two months, Yousef said. (Imagine a porta-potty after that long, for context.)Since receiving funding in 2018 from the Humanitarian Grand Challenge, an international acceleration award, the iThrone has been piloted in vulnerable communities without access to safe sanitation in Uganda and Panama. Change:WATER Labs hopes to scale up the project. Last year, the WHO and UNICEF’s Joint Monitoring Programme estimated that around 3.5 billion people — 43% of the world’s population — have no access to a toilet or latrine connected to wastewater treatment or safe disposal. Nearly a billion of those people use unsafe pit latrines or buckets, or defecate in the open.“When you shrink the waste at the point of production, essentially, you do a better job of containing it hygienically, so it cleans up communities.” Yousef said. “But then on top of that you are not using, or polluting, any water.”Though the current version of the iThrone doesn’t yet put excrement to good use, future versions may be able to turn evaporated moisture from urine or feces into potable water, or convert the remaining stored waste into renewable energy, according to Yousef, who said the product will “get more sophisticated” with time.“I don’t think anyone living in a house with a flush toilet is within five or 10 years of saying, ‘Yeah, I want to give that up,’” she said. “But there are so many other applications. And they’re not all just for low-income or distressed, fragile populations. There’s public sanitation, green building, transportation. And there are so many places where people are tied to septic tanks.”In cities with developed sewer systems, radical change may take place out of sight. As California deals with worsening drought, for example, San Francisco now requires new buildings larger than 100,000 square feet to have onsite wastewater recycling systems. Local startup Epic Cleantec, which built the city’s first graywater reuse system in the luxury high-rise Fifteen Fifty, is bringing its system to residential developments, corporate campuses, factories and hotels around the state.At a new coastal development in the Swedish city of Helsingborg, meanwhile, a traditional sewage plant has been completely revamped into an innovative new treatment facility called RecoLab (which is short for “Recovery Lab”). A striking, building that ventilates high in the air, to keep odors at bay, RecoLab connects to every building in the new district through a three-pipe system that separates and recycles water containing human waste (or blackwater) from low-water vacuum-based toilets, graywater from bathtubs and washing machines, and organic matter from food disposal systems. By 2030, when the housing development is complete, RecoLab will serve 2,500 residents.“When you’re ‘source-separating’ the wastewater, it’s the same principle as when you’re separating plastic from metal — it’s easier to recycle,” explained Amanda Haux, business developer at RecoLab.“Ninety-four percent of the wastewater in our cities is actually very easy to clean,” she said, but mixing in blackwater contaminates what could be a reusable resource.As with dry composting toilets, RecoLab extracts nitrogen and phosphorus from human waste — as well as from food compost — and turns them into fertilizer pellets at a nearby factory. Biogas from recycled waste is converted into heating, while recycled water is used in the community swimming pool. As of now, the plant does not recycle graywater, due to strict Swedish government regulations on repurposing wastewater for drinking. But Haux is hoping that will change, particularly in municipalities where water shortages may become more common due to climate change.To demonstrate the project’s circularity, Haux hopes to eventually open a rooftop garden and restaurant on RecoLab’s premises, using its recycled fertilizer and water to grow ingredients. “The purpose is to raise awareness about wastewater as a resource. We shouldn’t hide it away in our cities,” she said. “This is actually a low-hanging fruit when we’re talking about circulation.”At the Venice Biennale, Renell invited Haux to talk about RecoLab in a fall seminar on new approaches to waste. The humble dry toilet and a large-scale urban sewage system may be at opposite ends of the spectrum, but they are both solutions to the same problem.“So many people get so excited about this topic,” Renell said. “Of course, the urban scale feels a bit more daunting, but even within that, there are these amazing examples going on.”“Going to the toilet needs to be quite simple,” Renell said. “If we want to compete with the with the current system, we need to provide something equally easy.”"

        "title": "The painter reframing ‘dandies’ for the female gaze",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Writing in 1863, the French poet and critic Charles Baudelaire turned his eye to a striking faction of Parisian and English high society, one militantly fanatical for appearances — so much that some were said to polish their boots with Champagne. “Dandyism is a mysterious institution,” he said of the cult of the fastidiously-dressed, 19th-century male, “no less peculiar than the duel.”Though himself no stranger to decadence — with a predilection for satin, velvet and changing his hair on a whim, Baudelaire squandered an inheritance with his louche taste for clothing and opium — he identified in the dandy’s subversive character a “burning desire to create a personal form of originality.”Scores of subcultures have embraced and interpreted the archetype in the decades since. Rather than Beau Brummell’s crisply-tied cravat, today the term “dandy” may summon visions of Harry Styles in a string of freshwater pearls or playwright Jeremy O. Harris’ natty Thom Browne suiting. But its preening, self-curated elegance remains, beyond limits of the gender binary or preconceived notions of how one “should” dress.“There’s not one definitive description,” observed the British artist Sarah Ball in a video call with CNN. “Gender norms are so blurred now, fantastically. It’s a moving scale, wherever we choose to be.”The concept of the dandy in the twenty-first century — and how it may be defined or disrupted — is the connective thread of Ball’s first New York solo exhibition, “Tilted,” which debuted at Stephen Friedman Gallery in Tribeca earlier this year. Comprising 10 large-scale, tightly composed portraits in Ball’s signature airy stretches of color, the show challenges conventions of gender and celebrates the exuberance of self-expression.Each of the personalities represented in “Tilted” is dressed in their own idiosyncratic accoutrements, rendered in minute detail: rakish beribboned headgear, delicate lace collars and bonnets, expressive makeup, oversized eyewear and, in one instance, even a cocktail glass, holding a slosh of liquid and the briny green of a Castelvetrano olive. Ball — who works from a studio in the small English town of St Ives, Cornwall, where artists have been drawn to the light and the sea for generations — typically finds her subjects through social media or on the street, attracted by their “degree of complete individuality,” she told CNN.Exploring the dandy persona has been a natural development for Ball, whose work needles the tension between self-identity and the performance of outward presentation. “It’s part of a much bigger idea: how we are defined by others or how we define ourselves. That can be anything — race, ethnicity, or religion, or sexuality or gender fluidity,” she told CNN. “I’ve always been very interested in how we present a version of ourselves externally; how our personality manifests itself.”For all the wit in the clothes, there is a stillness and a surreal quality in Ball’s portraits that place her subjects slightly out of time. “That is definitely something I seek when I’m looking for people to paint,” she said. Indelible personal style is also crucial to the allure. Ball doesn’t costume her subjects, though she edits details to balance the composition. “They’re ready-made, in a way,” she explained, “but then the painting really does take over.”At over eight feet tall, “Declan (In Simone Rocha With Eddie),” depicts an individual in a sumptuous, crystal-embroidered smock dress by the Irish designer, known for her rebellious take on historic ritual, “feminine” codes and gender play. Accompanied by their long-haired guinea pig Eddie, swaddled in a lace-edged handkerchief, Declan’s coiffed shag haircut could read 18th century Flanders — or any contemporary hipster enclave, be it in Brooklyn or Berlin.An encounter with the writer Andrew Solomon’s 2004 essay Dandyism, published years before Instagram and other social media became the de facto avenue for exhibitionist display, influenced the body of work, according to Ball. “I’ve always looked (at) and used historical archives as a way of connecting with what’s happening in the world at the moment,” Ball said. “It’s a bit tongue in cheek, but the idea of ‘promenade’ in showing oneself peacocking is the same as people use social media for, really.” (Cue Solomon, quoting the French novelist Jules Barbey d’Aurevilly, “To appear to be is to be for Dandies.”)Two figures in the show, Von and Henry, materialize in multiple guises, demonstrating the transformativeness of persona construction and the depth of what may lie beyond the surface. “I’m aware that Instagram allows us to curate an image, an idea of ourselves, but unless you know that person, you don’t really ever know whether that’s true,” Ball noted. “There’s that intersection where truth meets fiction.”Her interpretations on the dandy shows how mutable and fluid the persona is, as Ball name-checks a series of female inspirations for the ‘look;’ the outré trouser suits and cropped bobs introduced by designer Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel, screen cipher Marlene Dietrich and Sandy Powell, the flame-haired, bespectacled costume designer known for her collaborations with directors Martin Scorsese and Todd Haynes.What remains is pure individual verve. “I’ve always been drawn to people that have not followed one path or another…who are extroverts, theatrical, unusual, creative, and wonderful,” Ball said."

        "title": "‘They’re quite like us’: Scientists reveal groundbreaking finding on Stone Age piercings — and who wore them",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Archaeologists in Turkey have discovered groundbreaking evidence connecting prehistoric facial piercings to the bodies of the people who wore them.Personal adornment — including earring-like objects thought to be worn as piercings — has been documented among Neolithic or late Stone Age peoples in multiple locations across southwest Asia, with evidence from as far back as 12,000 years ago. But none of the objects interpreted as piercings had previously been directly associated with body parts where they may have been worn.Now, analysis of excavations at the archeological site Boncuklu Tarla in southeastern Turkey has revealed burials in which adornments for piercings were found placed near grave occupants’ ears and mouths. Dental wear on the lower incisors of these remains, dating to around 11,000 years ago, resembled known wear patterns caused by abrasion from a type of ornament called a labret, often worn below the lower lip.This is the first time that facial piercings in Neolithic people from southwestern Asia have been directly linked to the body parts that they perforated, researchers reported Monday in the journal Antiquity. Their findings further confirm that the practice was already common during the early Neolithic.People of all ages were buried at Boncuklu Tarla, but the newly described ornaments were found only near the remains of adults. This suggests that such adornments were not worn by children, and acquiring these piercings may have marked coming-of-age rituals within social groups, according to the study.There are some other types of evidence for coming-of-age rituals in the Neolithic, such as burials that arrange the body with certain artifacts “or the placement of the deceased in particular locations prescribed for a particular age group,” said anthropological archaeologist Dusan Boric, an associate professor at Sapienza Università di Roma in Italy, in an email.“But I cannot think of many other examples as convincing as this one,” said Boric, who was not involved in the study.Hunter-gatherers occupied Boncuklu Tarla from around 10,300 BC to 7100 BC, as people began to shift away from a nomadic lifestyle and form settlements. The site was first excavated in 2012 and has since yielded a bounty of ornamental objects from the Neolithic period, with approximately 100,000 decorative artifacts found to date — a staggering number, said study coauthor Dr. Emma L. Baysal, an associate professor of archaeology at Ankara University in Turkey.“The sheer quantity is unbelievable. This is a site of people who just adore adornment, more than at any other site,” Baysal told CNN. “They had masses and masses of beads and they made complicated things out of beads,” including necklaces, bracelets, animal-shaped pendants and decorations that could be sewn onto clothing, Baysal said.They also crafted ornaments for ear and lip piercings. Labrets, which are still worn in some cultures in Amazonia and Africa, come in a variety of forms: rounded, oblong and disc-shaped. Some are long and thin, but most have one end that is wider and flattened, and they vary in diameter and width.Scientists identified 85 objects from Boncuklu Tarla burials as ornaments worn in piercings, made of materials such as flint, limestone, copper and obsidian. The researchers classified the labrets into seven types, based on shape — all measured at least 0.3 inches (7 millimeters) in diameter, and the longest was just over 2 inches (50 millimeters) in length.Ornaments described as Type 1 had long shafts and a “nail-like appearance” and were probably worn “inserted into the flesh or cartilage of the ear,” according to the study. Elongated Types 2, 4 and 6 were also thought to be ear ornaments. By comparison, Types 3 and 5 labrets had shorter, more bulbous shafts — better-suited for lip wear. Type 7, a flattened disc, was also thought to be a kind of labret.Some of the labrets had been dislodged from their original positions in the graves, possibly by rodents, though they were still near the head and neck area of the human remains. Other pieces were still “lodged in position on the upper or lower surface of the skull or under the lower jaw,” the study authors reported.Scientists have long thought that Neolithic objects called labrets were used as piercings, “especially in relation to the mouth or ear,” Dusan said.“However, now we have inconvertible and robust contextual evidence from the site of Boncuklu Tarla that here and very likely at other broadly contemporaneous sites such objects were indeed associated with these parts of the body as they were found in burials and were likely worn in the same way in life.”Though children were buried with pendants and beads, none had ear ornaments or labrets near their heads, necks or chests, indicating that facial piercings were reserved for adults, the researchers concluded.“It’s probably something associated with being grown-up,” Baysal said. “Maybe a kind of social status associated with age, or a particular role in society.”For archaeologists who are working to piece together how prehistoric peoples presented themselves to each other and to outside groups, piercings and other types of body decoration “are the absolute best source of information that we have about people of these periods, until writing is invented and people are directly expressing themselves,” Baysal said.This form of personal expression may be rooted in the mythologies of traditional societies, Dusan added, in which “a specific genre of myths relates to the origin of ornaments and body decoration, suggesting a fundamental importance of decorating the body as an act that goes beyond purely aesthetic concerns,” he said. “Wearing bodily adornment might rather have been an act of personhood construction and protection.”More than tools or other artifacts of daily life, these adornments also share a highly relatable view of Neolithic people, as the human motivation to express identity or community through piercings and other personal ornamentation continues to this day.“When you put earrings on, you can’t see the earrings that you’re wearing. You’re not doing it for yourself, because you can’t see them. You’re doing it for how you project yourself to other people. And I don’t think that has changed for all these thousands of years,” Baysal said. “It’s a way that we can identify with people in the past and think, ‘Well, actually, they’re quite like us.’”Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine."

        "title": "Rem Koolhaas: ‘In all my buildings, I’m trying to escape’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Rem Koolhaas is always looking for an exit. The Pritzker Prize-winning architect behind the CCTV Headquarters in Beijing, and De Rotterdam in his homeland of the Netherlands, is prone to claustrophobia, and won’t risk triggering it with one of his own buildings. This fear has reshaped skylines, pushing upwards and outwards, leaving behind open, unfussy spaces inside Koolhaas’ modern exteriors. “In all my buildings, you could say I’m trying to escape,” he told CNN.Libraries and Koolhaas are not an obvious fit. The popular image of them — labyrinthine, stuffy, dimly lit ­— hardly aligns with his aesthetic sensibilities (“the typical illumination of libraries is deeply unpleasant,” he remarked). Yet his Seattle Public Library, completed in 2004, is one of his most famous works, and when he designed the Qatar National Library he tore up the rule book once again. Open, airy, you’d never know there were over a million books under its sloping roof, despite so many being so clearly displayed.The building in Doha opened in 2018, and it’s here that CNN recently spoke with the renowned founding partner of international architects OMA.Qatar, on the Arabian peninsula, is home to around three million people, the majority expats. Koolhaas has had multiple projects here, and says of all the places he’s worked, he has “maybe the longest-lasting relationship” with the country.It could’ve started earlier. In the late 1990s, Japanese architect Arata Isozaki was working for a local person of importance and called Koolhaas. “He asked me, do you want to design a bungalow for a horse?” the Dutchman recalled. “I was so puritanical that (I said), ‘A bungalow for a horse? Never.’ Now that I’ve been here much more, I realize that it could have been a fantastic opportunity.”Unsurprisingly for a man who wrote “kill the skyscraper” in 2004, Koolhaas does not believe tall is the be all and end all of place-making. “I still think that skyscrapers are not necessarily the most interesting topology that you can think of,” he said. There are other ways to cement a destination: airports, museums, and, yes, libraries. OMA, which is led by eight partners, has played a part in the stories of nations moving into the global spotlight, and not just Qatar. China, Colombia, Saudi Arabia — the company has produced significant work in them all. But despite having a hand in these narratives, Koolhaas is happy to let go of projects once they’re done.“Once (a building) exists independent of myself, I don’t consider that it was mine. I can almost forget that I was the one who played an important role in generating it,” he explained.In his uniform black turtleneck and trousers (he has a longstanding relationship with Prada), he bristles at the mention of “starchitect,” a moniker which has dogged him for decades. “I hate it. I hate it because it’s a total caricature, and basically says you are an awful person who walks over people, who has no interest in clients, and who is a nightmare to deal with,” he bemoaned.“It’s a form of laziness of the critical apparatus, because I think there’s so much more to say,” Koolhaas added. “The word ‘star architect’ is so superficial in terms of the total engagement that building something requires … ‘Okay, he’s parachuted in and then he does a little trick and disappears.’ Every single building is so much work. I’m not saying that as a victim, but it’s so much work.”Koolhaas has thought extensively in recent years about use of space and resources. “Countryside: The Future,” a Koolhaas-led exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2020, posited the countryside had experienced radical change to make urbanization possible. That it had become a dumping ground for the structures a city needed to survive but could not handle — data storage and fulfilment centers and the like. As an architect commissioned to work at masterplan scale, it amounted to a period of reflection.The city itself is in need of a rethink, he argued. “Ultimately if we are to take sustainability seriously, climate seriously, I think we will maybe enter a period where skylines of cities become less heterogenous,” Koolhaas said. That means fewer extremely tall buildings rubbing shoulders with extreme horizontals. “I can also imagine that there will be a more equal distribution through city and country. I predict — but it’s a very dangerous prediction — that there will be new ways of inhabiting the countryside, but in a more responsible way.”Koolhaas has long been a philosopher king of architecture, both a standard bearer and a critical, contrarian presence. A former journalist, he still writes extensively, a “double life” he said, where he “can do and write what I want,” independent of his office.“It’s been equally exciting to also remain a writer,” he expanded, “and to think about issues that have nothing to do with myself, but that are simply comments on the situation in the world or perceptions; how cultures are changing, or insights in human relations.”The industry has little room for ideologues however, demanding pragmatism and occasional deference to market forces.Koolhaas says in the past, architects largely served a civic function, working for public bodies. The siren song of the private sector emerged around the time he entered the profession, during Ronald Reagan’s and Margaret Thatcher’s political ascendance in the late 1970s and 80s.“The period of neoliberalism that they unleashed of course had a huge impact on architecture,” he said. “In a very subtle way, (it) eroded the plausibility of an architect, because we could no longer say ‘we are doing this for the public,’ or ‘we are doing this for your wellbeing.’ We typically started working for individuals that had their individual ambitions.”Despite Qatar’s centralized power structure, led by an emir who signed off its National Vision 2030 project, Koolhaas names the country as a point of contrast, arguing there is a civic element to the work there. “Of course, they’re private plans, but the state of Qatar is very strong, and has these very defined ambitions, that as an architect you can work within and for,” he argued. “This is the one place where ambition has constantly outworn my skepticism,” he added.The relationship rolls on, with OMA designing the upcoming Qatar Auto Museum. The 30,000 square meter museum, on the site of the 2011 Qatar Motor Show, does not yet have a completion date, but is a fitting symbol for a petrostate pivoting toward a knowledge economy. Expect the usual hallmarks: the clean lines, the playful irreverence, the nods to local shapes and forms.Koolhaas might always be looking for an exit, but not from here."

        "text": "The disastrous Willy Wonka-inspired experience held in Glasgow, Scotland, last month has already been immortalized in an endless stream of meme-orabilia that will forever live on a corner of the internet.And now, some of the physical memorabilia that provided sparse decoration for the event’s venue has been preserved for an Ebay auction, where bids for it are already fetching almost $1,000.Monorail Music, an independent record store based in Glasgow, is selling three of the backdrops that were hung in an attempt to decorate the warehouse, after they were salvaged from the trash by a friend of Michael Kasparis, the store’s online manager.“He has a workshop underneath the venue that hosted the Willy Wonka experience and… the day after everything blew up, he was just at the bins and saw all this stuff lying there,” Kasparis told CNN Wednesday.“He thought ‘I’ll just take it’ and was joking to me and some other friends he had this… but then he said some good should come of it and we suggested that Monorail auction it for Medical Aid for Palestinians,” Kasparis added.Despite having a starting price of £10 ($13), the three backdrops have already fetched 48 bids on Ebay, including a highest one of £760 ($973) as of Wednesday morning. The bidding is set to end on Thursday at 3:10 p.m. local time (11:10 a.m. ET).“I’m anticipating getting into four figures,” Kasparis said, “which is what I’m hoping for.”A hastily handmade sign announcing the event’s cancellation was also sold last week by Box Hub – the venue that hosted the viral experience – for £840 ($1,075), with 80% of the proceeds donated to Glasgow Children’s Hospital Charity.“All comedy aside, we understand that many children and families were left disappointed after travelling from across the country for this event,” Box Hub said in an Instagram post on March 1. “We’d like to see some good from this.”Photos from the Willy Wonka-inspired event, with its quarter cups of lemonade handed out to each child, minimal decorations and actors dressed as Oompa Loompas, were endlessly memed across social media, even making its way into British politics when the opposition Labour Party jumped in on the fun.Two of the backdrops being sold by the record store depict a colorful candyland while another black and white one was used to create a “Time Tunnel,” the lot said, but they all look nothing like the fantastical images that had been used to advertise the event.Frustrated with that gap between the advertising and reality, families attending the experience became so angry that the police were called, and the event was eventually canceled.Organizer House of Illuminati said in its latest Facebook post that the “fallout from this event has been heart-wrenching,” adding that it was continuing to refund tickets, after apologizing multiple times in previous posts."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Shigeichi Negishi, the entrepreneur who invented the world’s first karaoke machine, has died aged 100.Negishi, whose 1967 “Sparko Box” prototype is among several devices credited with ushering in Japan’s karaoke craze, died from natural causes in January. His death, which was made public last week, was confirmed to CNN by Shiro Kataoka, managing director of the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association.Born in 1923, Negishi founded and ran a company that assembled car stereos for automobile manufacturers in northern Tokyo. A regular listener to a singalong radio show broadcast in Japan at the time, he hooked a spare tape deck up to a microphone and mixing circuit so he could hear himself singing over music.“When I asked the factory engineer, he said, ‘It’s easy,’” Negishi recalled in an account published by the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association, an industry body for Japan’s karaoke operators. “So, I attached a microphone input terminal to the car stereo and created something like the prototype of a jukebox.”According to author Matt Alt, whose interview with Negishi features in his 2020 book “Pure Invention: How Japan Made the Modern World,” the inventor first tested the device with an instrumental tape of Yoshio Kodama’s 1930s song “Mujo no Yume.”“It works!” he told Alt, recalling the moment he heard his voice coming through the speakers alongside the music. “That’s all I was thinking. Most of all, it was fun. I knew right away I’d discovered something new.”Marketing the device as a Sparko Box, he sold them alongside lyrics cards and reportedly produced and installed around 8,000 around Japan, mainly at bars and restaurants. By the time Negishi stopped selling the products in the 1970s, several rival machines had been invented and taken to market.“At that time, it was not customary to sing in stores, so it may have been inevitable that (the Sparko Boxes were) sold as background music,” reads Negishi’s entry on the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association’s website. “Now that I think about it, it’s a bit of a shame.”The industry body does not credit a single person with inventing karaoke (which literally translates as “empty orchestra”), but instead recognizes several people who independently created machines in the late 1960s and early 1970s.Perhaps the best known of them is musician and businessman Daisuke Inoue, whose 8 Juke machine — invented in 1971, and also based on a car stereo — is credited with helping commercialize karaoke.But Inoue, like Negishi, did not patent his invention, and electronics manufacturers soon began producing and marketing their own versions. By the 1980s, “karaoke boxes” (known elsewhere as KTVs) had swept Japan, with private rooms overtaking bars and restaurants as the main venues for Japan’s amateur singers.Subsequent developments, including the introduction of video karaoke and networked karaoke systems, helped the phenomenon spread across Asia and the world in the following decades.Today, Japan is home to more than 8,000 dedicated karaoke box venues, while 131,500 bars are equipped with karaoke machines — a market worth a combined 387.9 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in 2022, according to estimates from the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association."

        "text": "While there was an abundance of daring looks at the Oscars red carpet this year, one of the evening’s most memorable outfits came from Hollywood newcomer Sandra Hüller. The German actor’s arresting performances in “Anatomy of a Fall” and “The Zone of Interest” — two movies nominated for the Best Picture Oscar — have placed her front and center in the celebrity machine, and her red carpet style is pressing all the right buttons.Hüller arrived on Sunday night in a custom black velvet Schiaparelli hourglass gown, cinched at the waist and outstretched at the shoulders. The surrealist, winged, off-the-shoulder structure was topped off with a central, padlock detail, a “Reflection de Cartier” necklace in white gold set with 392 diamonds and a slicked-back ponytail. The vertiginous silhouette — though difficult to pull off — was so nice, Hüller essentially wore it twice. Later that night at the Vanity Fair after-party, the actor stunned in another custom Schiaparelli frock with a sculptural winged neckline: This time in a buttery velvet and embroidered with rhinestones.“It’s been so fresh and fun to look at a piece through Sandra’s eyes because of the level of excitement she brings,” Hüller’s stylist, Jordan Johnson Chung, told Vogue.But if the Oscars were your entry point to Hüllers house of cerebral fashion, don’t stop there. The Academy Award-nominated actor — last week revealed as the face of fashion designer Phoebe Philo’s 60-piece second drop — has been storming the red carpet for months, offering up a range of refreshing looks, from the collarless, sequined Louis Vuitton suit (topped off with a tousled shag haircut) she wore to the 2024 Cesar Film Awards earlier this month to the thigh-high maroon Bottega Veneta boots she donned for an appearance on Jimmy Fallon.Scroll down to see Hüller’s sharpest sartorial moments."

        "text": "The red carpet at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre shimmered on Sunday, as the stars arrived at the Oscars in a flurry of sequins, sparkles and striking metallic gowns.Lupita Nyong’o’s Armani Privé dress, Gabrielle Union’s bedazzled Carolina Herrera number and Michelle Yeoh’s custom Balenciaga gown were among the glittering looks on display during an elegant — if somewhat unadventurous — evening of red-carpet fashion. (Indeed, a fair number of attendees opted for monochrome black, white or black-and-white ensembles.)Elsewhere, “Barbie” actor America Ferrera gave the metallic trend a pop of color in a pink chainmail design by Atelier Versace, while co-star Margot Robbie took a rare break from Barbie-pink in an equally glistening black Versace dress. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande also opted for color-coded dressing, with the former’s emerald-green leather Louis Vuitton dress and the latter’s pillowy pink custom Giambattista Valli gown nodding to their roles in the forthcoming movie adaptation of “Wicked.”This awards season has provided plenty of florals, cut-outs and sheer gowns, but the Oscars heralded a new theme altogether: mermaid chic.Sunday’s red carpet was awash with gowns channeling scallops and shells, from Anya Taylor-Joy’s Christian Dior Haute Couture gown, inspired by Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus,” to Best Actress nominee Carey Mulligan’s custom Balenciaga look featuring an elegant mermaid skirt. Elsewhere, Emma Stone wowed in a shell-inspired custom Louis Vuitton dress with a flared peplum waist, and Hailee Steinfeld looked ethereal in a sea foam green Elie Saab Couture design.The evening’s menswear was relatively pared back, on what is usually the most formal of Hollywood red carpets (though that didn’t stop Simu Liu and “Young Royals” star Omar Rudberg from turning up shirtless). Even actors known for colorful suiting like Colman Domingo and Ryan Gosling, who arrived in Louis Vuitton and Gucci, respectively, stuck to a largely black palette, though many accessorized with broaches, bracelets and pins. Gosling did, however, make the change into a hot-pink number for his performance of the Best Original Song-nominated “I’m Just Ken” during the ceremony.Ramy Youssef, Mark Ruffalo, Mahershala Ali and Finneas meanwhile used their lapels to call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. They were joined by a handful of other attendees — including Billie Eilish, Ava DuVernay and Quannah Chasinghorse — wearing red pins as part of the Artists4Ceasefire campaign.Scroll down to see the best looks from the 96th Academy Awards."

        "title": "A tech company is growing diamonds in the desert",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Diamonds are the hardest material on Earth — and finding one in nature is comparably tough.For thousands of years, humans have dug deep into the Earth in search of diamonds, creating some of the world’s largest manmade pits in Russia and South Africa that descend as much as 625 meters (2,050 feet) below the ground.The intensive process has an impact on both nature and people, with dangerous working conditions and practices that damage ecosystems.But mining isn’t the only way to source diamonds. The first lab-grown diamond (LGD) was produced in the 1950s, according to the International Gem Society, and the technology has continued to develop, enabling labs to grow gem-quality crystals at affordable prices — up to 80% cheaper — without the sustainability and ethical concerns of mining.And growing diamonds artificially means you can bring diamond production to the most unexpected places — including the desert.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a global leader in diamond imports and exports, but it does not have any diamond mines. So entrepreneur Mohamed Sabeg saw an opportunity to not just trade diamonds, but grow them.In 2022, he co-founded Dubai-based 2DOT4 Diamonds, becoming the first to produce, cut, and polish lab-grown diamonds in the UAE.“Our idea was to bring the mine to the consumer,” says Sabeg. “Instead of having diamonds flying all around the world, the diamond is produced and sold locally.”The company’s name, 2DOT4, comes from the refractive index of a diamond —the speed at which light passes through a diamond compared to air, which is approximately 2.4 times slower.For Sabeg, having a name that relates to a physical property of the gem is a representation that the pieces produced in a lab are identical to the ones in nature.“The only difference is that we control the pressure, we control the heat, we control the gases,” he says. “The mined diamond, you don’t control it, the Earth is doing it.”To grow a diamond, you start with a diamond, either lab-grown or mined, explains Sabeg. It’s called a “seed” and is usually around 0.3 to 0.6 millimeters thick. (2DOT4 makes its own seeds from the diamonds grown in-house.)Placed inside a reactor, the seed is exposed to gases such as hydrogen, methane, oxygen, and argon. It also undergoes a pressure of up to 180 torrs —around two-thirds of the pressure at the peak of Mount Everest — and reaches temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees Fahrenheit). In this way, carbon is slowly deposited onto the thin slice.Then, it’s a matter of time for it to grow in volume.“You decide the speed of growth by using different parameters: the lower your speed is, the better your quality will be,” explains Sabeg.On average, 2DOT4 grows its diamonds at a speed of around 0.01 millimeters per hour. This means that every 24 hours, the stone grows in length comparable to the thickness of two sheets of paper.Once the diamond has grown to at least five millimeters in height, the piece is called a “block,” and there are three possible outcomes. It can be sliced into more seeds, that will be fed back into the reactors to grow more diamonds. Or, based on demand, 2DOT4 will cut and polish the gem. It can then either be sold to jewelers and designers, or turned into a jewelry piece designed in-house.Currently, the US, China, and India dominate LGD production, with the latter two accounting for over two-thirds of global output, according to Paul Zimnisky, a diamond industry analyst and consultant based in the US.Besides jewelry, lab-grown diamonds are used in multiple industries, particularly when it comes to making tools that cut through dense materials such as concrete, marble, and metals.For example, China has “a multi-decade legacy of producing synthetic diamond for abrasive industrial application, so they have the know-how and the infrastructure to be a major producer of man-made diamond for jewelry as well,” explains Zimnisky.India, on the other hand, has been a long-standing leader in diamond cutting and polishing, and embraced LGD technology to jump into production, too. Last year, the country underwent a tax reform in the sector and pledged extra funding to further expand its man-made diamond industry.Given the UAE’s status as a top diamond trading hub and its diversification efforts away from oil, expanding into the lab-grown diamonds industry could be an important move for its economy, says Ahmed Bin Sulayem, CEO and executive chairman of the Dubai Multi Commodities Center (DMCC), a global trade hub that held the very first Lab-Grown Diamond Symposium.“With the rise of the LGD industry symbolizing the intersection of technology and trade, the potential it holds is monumental, [and] we are excited to see Dubai positioned as a pioneering force in this transformative era,” says Bin Sulayem.“Sixty years ago, if you tell someone this is a synthetic or a lab-grown diamond, they won’t even look at it,” he adds. But younger generations are more concerned about ethical and environmental issues associated with mining, and are drawn towards the affordability of luxury goods, “so the industry has to adapt,” he adds.Entering the LGD production space could be a challenge, though. According to Zimnisky, competing with India and China will be difficult at scale, “unless you have a competitive advantage, or have a niche or specialized business.”Other UAE companies are following 2DOT4 and setting up their LGD business in Dubai, including Eviqe Diamonds, a part of HRA Group, which set up its production facility in the Emirate just a few months ago. Meanwhile, local brands such as Etika and Eayni are marketing their designs using lab-grown gems only.For the DMCC, the goal is to encourage the entire production to be done in-house, as a way of adding value to the final product and strengthening the local industry.“The key message we are giving to the lab-grown diamond industry is, don’t waste your time on selling the diamonds: focus on the final art,” says Bin Sulayem.For Sabeg, the hope is that 2DOT4’s creations are laying the foundation for the future of LGD production in a country that currently imports more diamonds than anywhere else in the world.“Our way of looking at what we are doing is to set a standard in the industry,” he says."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Lord Norman Foster, renowned as one of the world’s foremost architects, has dedicated decades to redefining the concept of tall buildings. His portfolio boasts iconic structures such as London’s 30 St Mary Axe (better known to Londoners as the “Gherkin”) and the HSBC building in Hong Kong. Now, he’s set his sights on Qatar.Currently nearing completion and set to reach a height of 301 meters (988 feet), Foster’s Lusail Towers are poised to claim the title of Qatar’s tallest buildings, surpassing the current record holder, The Torch Doha.Part of a 1.1 million-square-meter project conceived by Foster + Partners, the towers’ construction is a pivotal component of the larger masterplan for the city of Lusail, situated 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of the capital, Doha.Breaking ground in January 2020, the Lusail Towers stand amidst a plethora of new developments in the area, including Lusail Stadium, also designed by Foster + Partners for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Comprising four distinctive blocks, two standing at 70 stories and two at 50 stories, each tower is intended to serve as a hub for Qatar’s financial institutions.“As an architect, I find myself engaging with cities in their infancy,” Foster said. “We’ve made a mark for what is essentially a new district, laying down infrastructure for future generations.”To address the unique challenges presented by Qatar’s hot climate, Foster’s team had to depart from the materials commonly used in skyscrapers in cooler countries – part of what Foster called a decades-long quest to “reinvent the tall building.”“You think so many times of the tower being a glass tower, but (with) the whole climate here and the issue of sustainability … you really want to defend against solar gain,” he added.The design incorporates advanced shading and ventilation, while the towers’ exteriors are coated with “marine-grade” aluminum that wraps around the buildings, protecting the glass from strong sunlight while maintaining the views and still letting in natural light.Central to the project are special shading fins, akin to gills, which not only optimize views and natural lighting for occupants but reduce solar radiation by 70% compared to traditional all-glass towers.“What we’ve done here is create a sense of identity drawn from real needs,” Foster said. “It’s not a fashionable imposition, it’s generated from the realities of the climate.”According to Luke Fox, project lead and senior executive partner at Foster + Partners, this shading system contributes to a 35% reduction in cooling requirements and overall energy consumption.The towers are strategically placed to create maximum shading, and as they rise their shape shifts by rotating 90 degrees.“We made sure that the towers were deliberately placed to rotate slightly, providing perspectives between them as they rise above ground level. It’s quite unique. They appear as distinct entities,” Fox said.While the towers are poised to become a recognizable landmark for Lusail, Foster believes that a city’s skyline reflects what lies beneath the surface. He says it was crucial for his team to integrate the towers into a “low-scale master plan.”They are strategically positioned on top of a metro line and at the end of a commercial boulevard linking the waterfront to the nearby football stadium, which recently hosted the final of AFC Asian Cup.According to Foster, the ground features of the plaza will be instrumental in the overarching objective of transforming the area into a vibrant public space for the future.“What isn’t always apparent from those distant views is the pedestrian experience. It’s the lower infrastructure that binds these diverse elements together,” Foster said.The Lusail Towers are set to be completed in phases over the next 12 months."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Sofía Vergara’s palatial estate in the star-studded Los Angeles neighborhood of Beverly Park evokes an old-world grandeur fit for royalty. But in curating the space, the actor wanted to ensure that guests would feel comfortable there.“I’m not afraid to spend money, but it has to be for something practical, not just things that are there to look good,” Vergara told Architectural Digest. “I didn’t want furniture that is so precious that people would be afraid to use and enjoy it.”Vergara, the “Modern Family” star who more recently played notorious crime boss Griselda Blanco in the eponymous Netflix series, is on the March cover of Architectural Digest — one of several celebrities who opened their doors to the magazine for its “Hollywood at Home” issue.“AD began in Los Angeles more than 100 years ago, and the city and its architecture continue to charm and influence the design world, even today,” the magazine’s global editorial director Amy Astley said in a statement. “For this year’s ‘Hollywood at Home’ issue, we went inside the private spaces of some of the most innovative industry talents.”Vergara’s home is brimming with historical charm and opulent details — Baroque armchairs in the living room, a Spanish tole chandelier in the cavernous family room and hand-embossed floral plaster detailing on the dining room ceiling. But achieving the look, and allowing those features to stand out, required a significant transformation: “There were arches on top of arches, all with columns. It felt like a castle in Transylvania,” Vergara said, recalling how the property looked when she first bought it.Hoping to modernize her new home, Vergara brought in designer Ohara Davies-Gaetano, who also spoke to Architectural Digest for the feature. “Sofía articulated a clear vision for the project,” the designer is quoted saying. “She wanted a home that felt ethereal yet grounded, something fresh, clean, and bright, with lots of great antiques that added patina and warmth to the architecture.The high-profile renovations have not been without controversy, however. Last November, contractors who worked on the property sued Vergara for $1.7 million, alleging that she breached contract and mistreated employees, court records show. Vergara’s attorneys disputed the accusations, and filed a counterclaim last month, alleging the contractor sued erroneously after Vergara complained of “negligent and inadequate work.”Though there are teal notes in Vergara’s soft furnishings, threads of color woven through rugs, and lustrous gold and bronze accents found on fixtures and furniture, the home’s palette is largely calming and neutral.“I don’t like crazy jolts of color,” Vergara told the magazine of her preferred color scheme. (Pastels were also a no-no, she explained, “because they remind me of ‘The Golden Girls.’”)The interiors are accented, however, with plants and greenery in many rooms — a lively design choice that both matches and accentuates the property’s sizable grounds, which include a stucco-roof pool house and an alleé of olive trees.The estate’s outdoor spaces — or rather, their potential — was a major draw for Vergara: “I loved that you could see the landscape from every room, even though there wasn’t much of a garden to look at yet. I knew what I would do to make it my own,” she said.Landscape designer and antiques dealer Stephen Block brought her vision to life, adding earthen pots, antique fountains and tropical elements that nod to the actor’s Colombian roots.The result is a lavish property ready for entertaining. “My friends from Colombia find any excuse to visit,” Vergara told AD. “There’s just something about this place that makes guests want to stay. It’s special. I still wake up every day thinking, I can’t believe this is my life.”"

        "title": "Inspired by a dream, this photograph became a symbol for a transformative protest movement",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Nine years ago, Sethembile Msezane stepped on top of a plinth, wearing a black body suit and stiletto heels, her arms adorned with wings she fashioned out of wood, velvet, and hair. Behind her, a statue of a man can be seen being lifted in the air. “Chapungu — The Day Rhodes Fell” has since become an iconic photograph, capturing the spirit of the #RhodesMustFall movement which led to the removal of 19th century colonist Cecil Rhodes’ statue at the University of Cape Town.Msezane was a studying for a Master’s degree in Fine Arts at the university during the protests, which saw students call for the Briton’s statue to come down, citing his legacy as being tainted with racism.“There is no way I could have conceptualized that moment and the way things unfolded on that day,” said Msezane, speaking to CNN from Cape Town. Her performance, and the resulting image — which has come to serve as a symbol for the historic day — was born from a recurring dream that haunted her around the time the protest movement began.The dreams centred around “Chapungu,” a sacred Zimbabwean bateleur eagle who Msezane embodied atop the plinth with her wings.Eight of the birds — which hold great spiritual value for the people of Zimbabwe — were immortalised in green-gray soapstone in the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe. As the site fell into disrepair, six were subsequently looted, and in the 1800s, one statue of Chapungu was given to Cecil Rhodes. While several have now been returned, to this day, it remains at Rhodes’ former home at the Groote Shuur estate in Cape Town, Msezane explained.“There have been political calls for her to return home, but for some reason, these calls have been denied,” she said. “There is a mythological belief that until she is returned home, there will be social unrest in Zimbabwe.”Msezane says that Chapungu, who is a totem of people’s hopes and aspirations in Zimbabwean society, was in collaboration with her consciousness on the day Rhodes fell. “She used my body as a vessel, and I accepted the call.”Even after the sculpture of Rhodes had fallen, Msezane stayed atop her plinth for another 20-30 minutes. “It was important for (Chapungu) to be present so that she could be seen, so that we can begin to see ourselves in her — and not in our history of subjugation and dispossession. That we too have histories of abundance and ancestral knowledge.”The image is currently on display in London as part of the South London Gallery and V&A Parasol Foundation’s exhibition “Acts of Resistance: Photography, Feminisms and the Art of Protest” which takes a journey through female-led resistance around the world, from the perils of illegal abortion in Chile, Poland, and the United States, to women-led protests in Iran and Bangladesh.Creating the work took its toll. The Chapungu piece — which involved Msezane standing on the plinth in high heels on a hot day for nearly four hours — was “pretty strenuous,” she said. She would hold the wings strapped to her arms aloft for two minutes before having to rest for 10, then start again.She was also afraid at the beginning. “When you make a work like that, you’re quite vulnerable,” she explained.“I was scared because what if the police come and take me away, while this very important historical occasion is happening? What would happen to me, having been taken away wearing a leotard and some stilettos? Would I be pushed over? Could I potentially hurt myself or die?”Afterwards, she was shaking. Her limbs were tired, her feet painful and her vision blurred. “All I wanted were my clothes,” she says, of stepping off the plinth. “I just wanted to go home and take a bath.”When the Chapungu work garnered so much international attention, Msezane continued on with her life and didn’t think much about it.“I was still within the tension of what was happening,” she said, referencing the Rhodes movement and what would lead to the Fees Must Fall campaign. While her work was receiving acclaim, she was being targeted for her involvement with the movement.“My work was being cited everywhere and it meant very little to me to be honest, when that was the reality I was living… the system still finds ways to oppress you, even though a work like that can give you a voice.”Sometimes, she fears that the meaning of the piece is lost — with the focus being on Rhodes and not the symbol of Chapungu, who has “become a beacon of hope for many.”For Msezane, the work has inspired her to think about how else we can help women around the world. She no longer performs “endurance works” like Chapungu, citing how taxing, dangerous, and emotional such they can be. Instead, she uses her art as a tool for change in other ways — such as by donating profits from the sales of her work to fund charitable endeavors (she has previously supported the Panzi Hospital in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which provides health care for over 80,000 women and girls who are survivors of conflict-related sexual violence).From a young age, Msezane was a creative at heart — expressing herself through poems, drawings, and dress, but she did not expect to become an artist.“I didn’t think that being an artist would be viable for me,” she explained. With encouragement from her aunt, she set off to study fine arts at the University of Cape Town — an experience which she describes as “very frustrating,” due to the curriculum’s Eurocentrism.“I kept fumbling over concepts of Africans not being producers of their own work but being faceless and nameless.”While observing Cape Town’s landscape and architecture, Msezane became inspired to think about what the city had to say about black women’s histories. “I found it to be quite barren of our stories,” Msezane told CNN.This observation marked the start of her Public Holidays performance art series, when Msezane would use the day off from her job as an arts administrator to stage performances in the city.“It became a task for me to re-insert some of the histories I was thinking about on political public holidays, in relation to colonial, male, European statues,” she said. She performed as Lady Liberty on Freedom Day, Rosie the Riveter on Worker’s Day. Not long after, Msezane left her day job and started practicing full-time as an artist. “It’s kind of how life panned out… it was a calling.”Now, suspended from a ceiling in a south London gallery, Msezane’s image greets visitors and commands their immediate attention. “I want for them to walk in with a sense of wonder and to let that wonder take over their senses,” she said. “When they view the image, let them go where they need to.”"

        "title": "I’m 70 years old — why shouldn’t my clothes convey my sexuality, and sense of style?",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "(CNN) — In the fall of 2019, I received an e-mail from a group of Parsons Fashion Design and Society MFA students who had been given the assignment to make a collection of clothes for “seniors,” as part of a course that involves creating designs that focus on disabled, plus-size, transgender and aging people. The students were divided into four teams, with each team charge to find a muse/collaborator within their respective category — to ensure primary research and a meaningful outcome. The students asked me for an interview, hoping that I might become their muse.The students had gone around to senior centers, asking what older people want in their clothing. The answers — focused more on issues of fit, comfort and disguising signs of age — had discouraged them. Though these elements are important, the students seemed to want an aesthetic of age that could inspire them; they want to make old age high fashion, something beyond just function. (I think to myself that these fashionable young people want to design clothes they can see themselves in when they grow old.) But as we speak together, the fluid internal experience of aging, the memories held, and the desire to evoke them in what we wear are topics they become animated and excited about. Along with their tutors, these students and I begin our work together.The process starts with me bringing in pieces from my wardrobe that hold meaning for me: There is the sleeveless A-line dress with pastel green and purple flowers that I wore under my doctoral gown the day I received my PhD; the Yohji Yamamoto suit I wore to my first day of class as a professor of social work and law. There is an oversized burnt-orange coat that covers me like a blanket, which I wear when I want to feel warm and safe, and a paisley Indian print dress I wore in the 1970s and now throw on when I go to the beach. Its colors are faded, and the thin cotton fabric is almost transparent after being worn for so many years — it seems on the brink of disintegration.We have many conversations about the experiences attached to clothing during different periods of my life. We discuss how what I wear now, or want to wear, can allow experiences from different times of my life to be remembered. My young friends are curious about how I came to be empowered to wear what I want, to use clothes as devices to tell my personal stories and see style as being unique to every person.I shared with them how my partner Calvin and I were recently walking around Harlem taking photos, and came upon the only remaining Kangol hat store in the world. I’m not a hat person at all, but I had a Kangol beret I used to wear backwards with overalls and a velvet shirt silk screened with Our Lady of Guadalupe when I was first exploring my creative self in the early 1990s, right after I left my marriage and was about to turn 40. (The shirt was a nod to my preoccupation with Frida Kahlo after a trip to Mexico, but I digress.)The point is that when I walked into that store, I was transported back to that time. I heard the music and remember the galleries I went to, the classes I took and the books I read. So I try to explain to the students that it’s not that I need to wear exactly what I wore then, but clothes that evoke feelings and memories I felt. An approach to style that comes from our unique identities can convey a sense of time and place. And an article of clothing or an accessory contains history; it is a device that one can use to tell a story, one that is as different as the people who put it on.The students and I speak a good deal about what it means to be old. Each week I arrive for a fitting of what they design, and the tutors give a critique. This becomes a conversation about how bodies change as we age.The tutors and I observed how stereotypes and preconceived notions about being old found their way into the sessions, giving us the opportunity to question them. How the students’ initial designs cover me completely, for example, not acknowledging that I might still be a sexual being. By default, clothing for other adults is made to cover up their aging bodies. After this conversation, the textiles become more transparent — though they remain respectful.Usually, garments made for aging bodies are not modern or representative because they don’t take into consideration the disconnect between the internal experiences of older people and the reality of their physical bodies. Many older people still feel youthful and engaged.This results in the production of intricately crafted bespoke textiles, and clothes are not retro but modern — clothes that convey the sexuality and rebellious spirit that still inhabits me. The students create a dress made of crocheted Paisley prints in oranges and earth tones; a black coat with visible layers of varying tones and textures of grey and shaped like a cocoon that opens to reveal a transparent shirt; pants and a tunic with green and purple flowers caught in a spider web knit. These are pieces that turn remembering and aging into something that is modern and new — not just a retrospective view of a long life.Each outfit created became a scene that performed a story of a life, a narrative that revealed some secrets about how to be old.For the students, understanding the developing nature of identity as opportunity and deconstructing standardized notions of the “ideal” body are gifts they took away from the process. In their designs, they layered years of memory and meaning and saw aging in a way that was additive, not subtractive — something to look forward to.The clothes the students designed for me made me feel understood. Working with younger people and solving this problem together reminds me of the utility of intergenerational collaboration, deep listening and mutual respect. Can you imagine, if we worked together so creatively on the multitude of issues we face in this current time, how we might change the way we think about being old or young?"

        "title": "The eyes have it: The intriguing history of kohl",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Kohl use in the Middle East and North Africa is as rich and varied as the region itself. The earliest iteration of eyeliner — which has been integral to Arab culture for millennia — can be traced back to ancient Egypt where it served not only beautification purposes but was also thought to offer protection against the harsh desert sun and even the evil eye (which can signify a curse or an ill-intentioned glance).Over the centuries, the use of kohl spread across the Arabian Peninsula, eventually becoming a staple in the daily lives of both men and women with its wide-ranging applications — aesthetic, medicinal, religious, and practical. It is believed that Crusaders may have brought the practice of using kohl back to Europe.The methods of preparing and applying kohl have also reflected the region’s diverse cultural landscapes. The pigment is typically made from natural materials; Emiratis have historically preferred date seeds, for example, while in Lebanon, cedar honey and even the gallbladder of a hyena have been used.In rural communities, residents often produce their kohl at home, or in group settings. The process involves sourcing readily available ingredients, such as plants, tree sap, or stone, which are then burned to soot, melted, or ground into powders with a mortar and pestle. Much like their Ancient Egyptian counterparts, Emirati women even had their kohl buried with them, along with their jewelry and pottery.During Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, I’ve often thought of Tamam Farhan Abu Issa, a resident of Gaza’s city of Deir al Balah. I stumbled upon her story while researching my book, “Eyeliner: A Cultural History,” which traces the evolution of the cosmetic, from its ancient roots to its modern variations. Using methods passed down for generations, in 2022, Abu Issa spoke enthusiastically of how she sought to preserve the historical art of making kohl. “Okay, girls, this kohl, I made it myself,” she proudly says in a video produced by UNESCO, a United Nations agency, which worked with Palestinian artisans to help document and safeguard traditional handicrafts. “It is an old product that is part of the heritage of the Palestinian people.”Abu Issa demonstrates how to make the pigment: she begins by soaking a piece of cotton cloth in olive oil, using old robes decorated with tatreez (Palestinian embroidery) to absorb the excess oil. She then places the cloth under an aluminum pan and allows it to burn above a flame overnight. The process produces soot, which accumulates on the underside of the pan; the superfine powder is then collected and stored as kohl in ornate brass pots. Abu Issa dips an applicator moistened with olive oil into the pot to gather the pigment, then smoothly drags it along her lash lines, darkening her eyes.Against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, the preservation of customs like kohl-making assumes greater significance in the Palestinian context. As demonstrated by Abu Issa, the process reflects not only one method of creating an age-old cosmetic, but also a deep connection to Palestinian cultural traditions, and by extension, the region’s broader history. Further, the practice embodies a form of cultural continuation — perhaps even cultural resistance.From the deserts of Saudi Arabia and Jordan to Palestinian villages, kohl is used during special occasions such as weddings, childbirth, and religious celebrations. (Abu Issa speaks of how her grandmother advised her to apply kohl around her children’s eyes upon their birth to help them sleep at night, for example). Some Muslims consider the wearing of kohl to be Sunnah — meaning the way of the Prophet Muhammad — given he was said to have worn a form of it to treat his eyes medicinally.The tradition also finds its origins in various communal practices, including those of the Bedouin, the nomadic peoples of the Arabian deserts. There, kohl is traditionally applied not only along the waterlines, for its aesthetic appeal, but also around the entire eye area — beneath the lower lash line and sometimes above the upper lash line. The application has a dual purpose: to enhance the beauty of the eye, and to provide protection against the sun’s glare, wind, and sand. This reverence for kohl is mirrored in Saudi Arabia, where some men (such as the “Flower Men” of the Qahtan tribe) wear it to honor their tribal heritage.In Bedouin society, the application of kohl is also considered a rite of passage into manhood and a marker of singledom. Among the younger Bedouins, there’s a playful acknowledgment of kohl’s impact on one’s appearance: of his heightened good looks after applying kohl, Raed, a 19-year-old Bedouin, jokingly told me in an interview conducted in Petra for my book research, “Do I look like Jack Sparrow, or does Jack Sparrow look like me?’” (In 2010, the cosmetic’s allure spurred the UAE General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments to issue a fatwa, or formal ruling, allowing its use, so long as it wasn’t to attract the opposite sex.)Kohl has withstood the test of time, enduring eras of profound upheaval, including wars, colonialism, occupation, the rise and fall of empires, natural disasters, and significant cultural shifts. It has survived prolonged periods of economic tumult, globalization, and changing beauty standards.As such, well before eyeliner was adopted as a now-ubiquitous cosmetic in the West, it was already deeply entrenched in Middle Eastern and North African cultures. In the region’s folklore, literature, song, and dance, kohl has been celebrated for centuries. The image of kohl-lined eyes is a recurring motif in various Arab art forms: in poetry, for example, Middle Eastern and Arab women are portrayed as being staggeringly beautiful in part due to their “oyoun al sood” (black eyes) or “oyoun kaheela” (kohl-rimmed eyes.) Kohl is so commonly worn in the area that girls are sometimes named or nicknamed Kahla by their parents or friends, roughly meaning “the girl who appears to have kohl around her eyes.” Kohl is also a feature of many ­millennia-old myths, rituals, and legends. Zarqa al‑­Yamama (Blue Dove), a heroine of pre­-Islamic folklore, was famed for the strength of her eyesight, which was credited to her use of kohl.Today, kohl maintains its status across the Arab world and in Muslim communities, though its use has evolved. On social media platforms, kohl has gained popularity among young women, bridging tradition and modernity. Instagram and TikTok feeds feature posts from Arab and Muslim influencers and makeup enthusiasts showcasing their kohl-lined eyes. “There we are!” says TikTok influencer “Blinkaria Kohl Girl” (who has more than 33m likes) after applying the product in a tutorial. “You get waterline and tightline.” (Waterlining involves drawing eyeliner onto the inner rim of the eyelids for a dramatic look, while tightlining is the application of pigment at the base of the lashes for a subtle, fuller-lash effect; both are centuries-old).Younger generations have incorporated modern beauty trends like liquid eyeliner into their routines as urban areas have experienced a shift towards imported Western or South Asian eyeliner brands for practical purposes. “Kohl is simple to make,” observed Abu Issa of Gaza, “but many women find it easier to use ready-made products. This could be because they are impatient or want to avoid getting their hands dirty.” Handmade kohl (often purchased from local souks or sellers) is still sought after despite these shifts, particularly among those who value cultural continuity. Maram, an Egyptian woman in her mid-30s, told me in an interview for my book, “I grew up believing kohl was a traditional Egyptian practice. When I started using kohl as a teenager, I thought it looked cool. And I’ve continued to wear it every day since.”For Abu Issa and indeed many across the Arab world, myself included, making kohl is not only a craft; it is a tangible link to her grandmother’s legacy, and to her identity. “Even if she doesn’t (make kohl) anymore, I will for sure continue to do this myself,” Abu Issa said. “I’m happy to produce something for my personal use. I’ve done something good for myself.”"

        "category": "style",
        "text": "On Tuesday, a starry guestlist poured into the regal halls of London’s National Portrait Gallery for the museum’s first fundraising Gala since its hefty three-year remodel completed in 2023. Against the backdrop of 1700s portraiture, former British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, artist Tracey Emin and Dame Kristen Scott Thomas (now a Miu Miu catwalk model as well as a BAFTA Award-winning actor) were snapped in their frocks and tuxedos, adhering to a dress code of “glamour.”With many attendees from the upper echelons of the British creative scene choosing to champion homegrown labels — Alexa Chung wore Erdem, TV presenter Maya Jama opted for a satin, off-the-shoulder Vivienne Westwood number — one could imagine a born-and-bred Californian could feel daunted. But Hole singer Courtney Love certainly got the memo. Straying from the London Fashion Week mainstays, Love instead chose to revive a name from fashion history — and arrived in the biggest (and arguably the best) gown of the evening.Dressed in a waterfall of gray silk duchess satin and black tulle, Love was the punk princess of St. Martin’s Place. And it was no wonder, considering the 18th-century inspired gown was the work of Elizabeth Emanuel, Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer.The custom look was a variation on Emanuel’s “Marie Antoinette” frock which Love had spotted in last month’s copy of British high-society gossip magazine, Tatler. Originally designed in pale pink, Love’s version was fashioned out of a darker palette for more drama. Emanuel added crystal appliques at the waist, while the corset itself was boned and fastened with black lacing. Most captivating of all, perhaps, was the bustle skirt silhouette, hand-draped by Emanuel. “The effect was very grown up (yet) ‘Princess’ like,” she told CNN via email.Dress designer Emanuel rose to fame when she received the commission of a lifetime in 1981. The gown she created for Princess Diana’s wedding to Prince Charles — a pearl-embellished, ivory taffeta dress complete with ‘80s puff sleeves and a 25-foot train — has since gone down in history as one of the most iconic moments in fashion. In June 2021, 40 years after it was worn down the aisle, the dress was exhibited at Diana’s former home in Kensington Palace.Later in the evening, Love is photographed stepping behind the decks to DJ. An outstretched arm shows a torn tulle sleeve — snagged presumably while she was lost in the music. The mark of a true people’s princess."

        "title": "What this playful photo reveals about Hong Kong’s infamous ‘Walled City’",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "It was the summer of 1989. Hong Kong’s humidity – already oppressive – was intensified in the dark, maze-like alleyways of an unruly enclave known as Kowloon Walled City. Then the most densely populated place on Earth, its buildings were packed together so tightly that barely a slither of sky was visible from the ground.Searching for a moment of respite from the heat and chaos below, photographer Greg Girard found himself on the roof of one of the enclave’s many illegally-built high-rises among a tangled thicket of television antennas.He wasn’t alone. In the Walled City, the delineation of private and public spaces “wasn’t always so clear,” Girard recalled in a video call, adding that the roof was an escape for many of its residents to relax, do laundry or watch planes land at Kai Tak International Airport. “Once you get up to the rooftop, everything sort of changes. The vista opens up, and it’s cooler, there’s a breeze.”Navigating the narrow gaps between buildings with planks of wood, children would skip and play between the webs of laundry lines and satellites. “No one seemed to think of it as a dangerous place, even though there were no guardrails or anything like that,” said Girard.On that particular summer day, some children spotted Girard’s camera and approached him. When he turned the lens on them, they began performing and pulling faces. He snapped several shots, describing the final one, which he eventually chose to publish, as the moment when they had “settled into this face-off with me.”In the photograph a young girl, barefoot and wearing a blue dress, stares into the camera. Her face is relaxed and her hands are wrapped around an antenna pole as if she’s about to swing. In the backdrop, her friend strikes a defiant stance, hands on her hips, while another is in the throes of messing around, bent double in a playful squat.“I thought (the image) captured the kids’ indifference to the potential danger … of the rooftop, while at the same time sort of owning their territory and confronting me while goofing around,” said Girard, adding: “It was just quite an average day up on (there).”The playfulness of the children, juxtaposed with the jagged antennas and stark concrete of their surroundings, seem to epitomized the spirit of Kowloon Walled City, the photographer said.“It wasn’t an ideal playground but that never seemed to bother anyone — which was, of course, very much the spirit of the Walled City: making the best of, and even enjoying life in, a situation most other people would be horrified by.”Girard first visited Kowloon Walled City in 1986 while on a shoot at the nearby airport.At that time, around 350 buildings, up to 14 stories high, were packed precariously into a space of 0.01 square miles. Most of the towers were built without proper foundations or regard for safety codes.“This strange, vertical village wasn’t really supposed to exist,” said Girard, explaining the Kowloon Walled City was the product of a historical and political quirk. Although the enclave was situated in the middle of Hong Kong, then a British colony, imperial officials refused to take legal responsibility for it. As such, the Walled City remained technically subject to Chinese rule, though this was never enforced.“That allowed it to become something you couldn’t have dreamed up,” Girard added.Existing in ambiguity for nearly a century, it had a reputation for illicit dealings and was infamous for its triads, drug dens, brothels and unlicensed dentistry.But by the time the Canadian photographer made his first visit to the “thriving” city in 1986, triad control had waned and these characterizations were, he said, “very out of date.”“It might have been true at one time,” he added. But his enduring memory of the place was the community that lived there. “You quickly realize that it’s just a place where folks are trying to get by, like any other working-class part of Hong Kong.”Girard was determined to demystify the so-called “City of Darkness,” particularly after the colonial government announced plans in 1987 to demolish it. He spent four years documenting the Walled City with fellow photographer Ian Lambot, with the pair eventually publishing a book of their images in 1999.Early on, Girard decided to photograph the series in color and used portable lighting equipment — similar to the kind he used to capture celebrities and CEOs for glossy magazine portraits.“The only pictures you saw of the Walled City at the time tended to be in black and white, and they made the place look as bad as possible, in keeping with the reputation of the Walled City as a dangerous, squalid slum,” said Girard. When it came to capturing people’s day-to-day lives, and images of residents, shopkeepers and factory owners, the photographer wanted to use “a more even-handed approach,” he added.Girard documented, among much else, the blurred chaos of noodle and fish ball factories, a young child inspecting his grazed knee on the counter of his family’s grocery store, and a barber curling a client’s hair. While initial reactions to his presence were often frosty (“there was a palpable unwelcomeness to outsiders,” he recalled), residents eventually allowed him into their cramped apartments.His guiding principle, Girard said, was “to try to show it for what it really was, since rumor and myths were the only things that were known about the place.”When the Walled City was razed, from 1993 to 1994, that was supposed to be the end of it. But in the decades since, the enclave has arguably garnered more interest than it ever did while standing. In 2014, Girard and Lambot published a “revisited” edition of their book that explored the city’s legacy in popular culture — including as an inspiration for fictional dystopias in video games and films, such as “Call of Duty: Black Ops” and “Batman Begins.”“The Walled City was this jumping-off point for an imaginary city where the normal rules don’t apply,” said Girard.There has been renewed interest in architectural circles, too: The unregulated, organic construction that made Kowloon Walled City a “dystopia” to live in is now being examined as a source of innovation due to its resourceful use of limited space and cheap or second-hand materials, said Girard.“The limitations of that place certainly spurred a lot of creative responses, in building terms, to (the question of) what to do in a place that no one cares about, or pays attention to, except the residents,” Girard added.The site of the Walled City has since been transformed into a public park, which opened in 1995. Quiet and uncrowded, it is in many ways the opposite of what it replaced, providing a much-needed reprieve from the clamor of a city desperately short on public space. Open-air chess pavilions and banyan-shaded ponds surround the old yamen building, a relic of the 19th-century Chinese garrison city that once stood on the site and the only structure to survive the demolition.Inside the building, Girard’s famous rooftop photo is blown-up to fill an entire wall, accompanied by an audio track of children laughing and the roar of airplane engines. The memory of a vibrant community — immortalized by photographers like Girard — lingers.Ongoing interest in the Walled City is, Girard suggests, because of the spirit it encapsulates: the aptitude for survival even in the harshest of circumstances. “It still continues to fascinate,” he said. “And that’s wonderful.”"

        "text": "Slicked-back hair, a leather jacket, a cross dangling from his ear and his trademark aviator sunglasses.This is how many of George Michael’s fans remember the late, great singer—and his image has now been immortalized just so on a new collectible coin issued by Britain’s Royal Mint.Visitors to the institution’s website had to wait in a virtual line to shop for the limited-edition coins, which went on sale at 9 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) local time on Monday.The design of the coin pays tribute to the late singer’s second solo hit single, “Faith,” according to the Royal Mint. In a statement published online, the mint, which is the official producer of Britain’s coins, said the George Michael coin is the latest addition to its Music Legends series. Similar issues have honored fellow British music stars David Bowie, Elton John and Queen.Officially approved by the estate of the Wham! front man, who died on Christmas Day in 2016 at age 53, the coin was designed by Italian artist and sculptor Sandra Deiana. The headshot is set against an engraving of the refrain of “Faith.”In a statement in the media release, Deiana said she was clear from the start that there were “certain elements” she wanted to include. She added: “I wanted a detailed portrait that captured his charismatic expression—I was particularly thinking of his iconic sunglasses. It’s amazing to be able to pay tribute to his music and what you see in the design is truly a piece of George Michael’s song.”The coin is available in several different finishes and weights, and ranges in price from £15.50 (around $20) to £2,770 ($3,500).In a career spanning four decades, Michael sold more than 100 million albums, with hit singles including “Careless Whisper,” “Faith” and “Jesus to a Child.”The singer, songwriter, producer and philanthropist rose to fame in the early 1980s as one half of Wham!, alongside bandmate Andrew Ridgley. The duo split in 1986 and Michael’s first solo hit was a duet with Aretha Franklin the following year—“I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me).”The issue of the coins comes two months after Wham’s “Last Christmas” reached number one in the UK—39 years after it was first released.Welcoming the coins’ creation, a statement from George Michael Entertainment included in the media release said: “On behalf of George Michael, we are deeply honored that the Royal Mint is paying tribute to him by creating a series of beautifully crafted coins. He would have been enormously proud and genuinely touched that a national institution should have decided to pay tribute to his memory in this way.”"

A third man filmed the demonstration.The museum said after the incident that the 17th-century masterpiece was “undamaged,” and it was returned to public view the next day. The Netherlands Public Prosecution Service added that the 19th-century frame had, however, been damaged in the protest.The men were convicted of causing destruction and damage to the painting, as well as public violence, a spokesperson for The Hague Court of Appeal told CNN, adding that the protestors spent 23 days in detention before the trial.Given the length of time that the demonstrators spent in pre-trial detention, the court said, a prison sentence would have been excessive.The court spokesperson told CNN that it also did not want to discourage others who wish to peacefully protest or exercise their right to freedom of expression. To punish these activists severely might have a “chilling effect” on others, the court said in a media statement.CNN has reached out to the Mauritshuis museum for comment.Just Stop Oil Belgium is not affiliated with its British namesake, environmental activist group Just Stop Oil. CNN was unable to contact the Belgian organization directly but has reached out to Extinction Rebellion Belgium for comment, as it has previously issued statements on behalf of Just Stop Oil Belgium."

        "title": "‘A strong signal to China’: Tiananmen Square massacre memorial erected outside European Parliament",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A model of the “Pillar of Shame,” a memorial to victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre that was controversially removed from a Hong Kong university in 2021, has gone on display in front of the European Parliament in Brussels.Depicting a heap of contorted bodies and screaming faces, the statue was unveiled Tuesday as part of an exhibition of “forbidden art” that organizers said had been censored or “deemed subversive” by Hong Kong and mainland China.The exhibition was hosted by Jens Galschiøt, the Danish artist behind the famous sculpture, and Kira Marie Peter-Hansen, a member of the European Parliament (MEP). A further six MEPs, including representatives from each of the parliament’s five largest political coalitions, were listed as co-hosts.Galschiøt wrote on his website that installing the artwork outside the European Union’s main legislative building sent a “strong signal to China that its censorship does not apply in Europe.”Speaking on the phone to CNN from Brussels on Tuesday, Galschiøt called on Western galleries and auction houses operating in Hong Kong’s lucrative art market to address perceived threats to freedom of expression in the territory. “I don’t think they want censorship either, but they (tacitly support it) because, if they don’t, they know it’s not possible to do business,” he said.Galschiøt created numerous versions of the “Pillar of Shame” in the 1990s and 2000s, though the one installed at Hong Kong University in 1997 — the same year the former British colony was returned to Chinese rule — is the best known among them. Until recently, Hong Kong was the only place on Chinese soil that tolerated memorials to Beijing’s bloody military crackdown on student protesters in 1989, and the sculpture was considered both a symbol and bellwether of free speech in the city.In 2021, after Beijing imposed a sweeping National Security Law on Hong Kong to ban sedition, secession and subversion, the university removed the statue under the cover of darkness and placed it in storage. Last May it was seized by the city’s police as part of an investigation into “incitement to subversion,” according to Reuters.At approximately eight feet seven inches tall (around a third the height of the Hong Kong version), the sculpture on display in the Belgian capital is not a replica but instead one of several smaller models Galschiøt produced in the 1990s. It stands atop a plinth featuring the artwork’s history and a message reading, “The old cannot kill the young forever.”Tuesday’s grand opening featured a performance of “Glory to Hong Kong,” a protest song that authorities in the Chinese territory are seeking to formally ban. The ceremony was followed by a series of debates featuring politicians and human rights activists.In a statement, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN that the country’s government has “long drawn a clear conclusion about the political turmoil that occurred in the late 1980s” and that “any attempt to discredit China will only end in failure.”The 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre remains one of the most sensitive political taboos in mainland China. Discussions of the event are strictly censored and any attempt to commemorate it can lead to imprisonment. Chinese authorities have not released an official death toll, but estimates range from several hundred to thousands.Last week, Galschiøt published a letter on his website that he and Peter-Hansen received from the Chinese Embassy in Brussels describing the exhibition and debates as “nothing but political maneuvering to grossly interfere in China’s domestic affairs under the pretext of democracy and human rights.” CNN was unable to independently verify the letter’s contents as the embassy did not respond to a request for comment.Elsewhere in the Brussels exhibition, which was organized alongside the Czech Republic-based non-profit NGO Dei, works by self-exiled Chinese artists are displayed alongside a photo of Lady Liberty, the statue of a masked demonstrator that became a symbol of the pro-democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong from 2019.The unveiling took place on the same day Hong Kong passed a second national security law giving police new powers to crack down on dissent. Critics and analysts have warned that the new legislation, which comes into effect Saturday, aligns the financial hub’s national security laws more closely with those used on the Chinese mainland, leaving the city’s artists and galleries with further uncertainties about what is, or is not, legally permissible.China and Hong Kong’s leaders say the new laws are needed to “plug loopholes” as part of their drive to “restore stability” following large-scale and occasionally violent pro-democracy, anti-government protests in 2019.The exhibition also comes as Asia’s largest art fair, Art Basel Hong Kong, prepares to open its doors to gallerists, dealers and collectors from around the world next week.In the years since Hong Kong’s “Pillar of Shame” was taken down, Galschiøt has unsuccessfully lobbied to have it returned by the city’s authorities. In the meantime, replicas and other versions of the work have been displayed in cities including Oslo, Taipei and Berlin.The artist said attempts to censor the sculpture had only strengthened its message.“I think its (power as a symbol) is getting much stronger,” he added. “I wouldn’t say China has helped us … but I think they made a really big mistake. If they’d just given me the sculpture back and said, ‘OK, it’s not allowed,’ then nothing would have happened.”"

        "title": "A nostalgic look back at when the Internet still felt joyful",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "At the turn of the millennium, web-based technology was in a state of chrysalis. Google was just one of several mainstream search engines, not yet a monopolistic empire. Dial-up internet (and its iconic dial tone) was still a thing in many American homes. File-sharing services like Napster and LimeWire were just beginning to take off. MP3 players and advances in 3D graphics represented brand-new technology.And in sweaty dorm rooms and sparse basements across the world, people brought their desktop monitors together to set up a local area network (LAN) and play multiplayer games — “Half-Life,” “Counter-Strike,” “Starsiege: Tribes,” “StarCraft,” “WarCraft” or “Unreal Tournament,” to name just a few. These were informal but high-stakes gatherings, then known as LAN parties, whether winning a box of energy drinks or just the joy of emerging victorious.The parties could last several days and nights, with gamers crowded together among heavy computers and fast food boxes, crashing underneath their desks in sleeping bags and taking breaks to pull pranks on each other or watch movies.Since then, much has changed. For one, the gaming world has evolved from a user-driven subculture to a multi-billion dollar industry that is less about getting together in person and more about a wider web of e-sports competitions, the lucrative intersection of gaming and content creation and a prominent corporate fingerprint on gameplay, design and monetization.Particularly for Gen Z gamers, a generation that grew up almost completely in the smartphone era, 25 years ago may feel like a different reality. But for millennials and Gen Xers, the boxy monitors and pixelated graphics will be familiar reminders of a not-so-distant technological past.It’s this nostalgia that prompted writer and podcaster Merritt K to document the era’s gaming culture in her new photobook “LAN Party.” After floating the idea on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, she received an immediate — and visceral — response from old-school gamers all too keen to share memories and photos from LAN parties and gaming conventions across the world.“I know that none of these are my friends and I,” wrote one X user in response to the images in K’s call-out post, “but because the photos feel so familiar I find myself looking for us all. This is pretty much how most weekends in 2000-2004 looked for us.”“Despite the fact that, in a literal sense, I am not in any of these photos, high school me is in every one of these photos,” another wrote.Many people who had never experienced the era of LAN parties also responded with excitement. “I think everyone has some kind of nostalgia for a period before they were alive,” K told CNN. “I had people who are 20 years old, who were tweeting and being like, ‘I was born in the wrong decade.’”Throughout the pages of “LAN Party,” there is an all-too evocative sense of fernweh — fond, wistful memories for a pastime in times past. It’s strange to remember that the internet was once a place you went to spend time with other real people; a tethered space, not a cling-film-like reality enveloping the corporeal world from your own pocket.“That time — the late ’90s, early 2000s — was pre-social media,” K said. “It’s the era of blogs and forums. No one really had 24/7 access. So even though we were starting to get high-speed internet, it was still a place that you went, rather than just another part of your life. And this feeling of connecting to people in other parts of the world was cool. It wasn’t something that was taken for granted yet.”Growing up as a teenager in this era, you could feel a sense of hope (that perhaps now feels like naivete) about the possibilities of technology, K explained. The book is full of photos featuring people smiling and posing with their desktop monitors, pride and fanfare apparent. At that point in time, many new tech products were designed with ostentatious playfulness in mind — cellphones were often blinged out or swiveled up, cameras came in hot pink shells and tech companies even collaborated with luxury fashion houses.“It felt like, ‘Wow, the future is coming,’” K said. “It was this exciting time where you felt like you were just charting your own way. I don’t want to romanticize it too much, because obviously it wasn’t perfect, but it was a very, very different experience.”It was also a new era for photography. Digital cameras — with which most of the photos in “LAN Party” were taken — had just become widely available to the public. As a result, the visuals are grainy, unedited and generally low quality by today’s standards. Documenting everyday life through images was still an anomaly, after all, K said. As such, people in the book’s photos weren’t yet conscious of their best angles, nor does it seem they were necessarily trying to look ‘good’ for the camera.“Some people are just making goofy faces, flipping the camera off,” K said. “No one really knows how to be in a selfie yet. When digital cameras show up, it starts to become a much more everyday thing… people are figuring out, ‘How do I look in this picture? What do I do?’”Of course, many of the photos also portend what was to come. They also contain early footprints of modern gamer culture stereotypes — dank, antisocial and seemingly unhealthy environments. (Despite gaming’s global popularity, today it is sometimes characterized as the domain of young White men, internalizing and disseminating racist, misogynistic or right-wing politics.)Still, “it was a little more communal,” K said. “If you’re playing games in the same room with someone, it’s a different experience than doing it online. You can only be so much of a jackass to somebody who was sitting three feet away from you, whereas today with online games, toxicity is a huge problem. Being anonymous online can inspire the worst in people.”Though they have significantly dwindled in frequency, LAN parties do still take place. (They have also maintained their status over the years as cultural iconography; a photo of a man duct-taped to the ceiling — but still playing “Counter-Strike,” mind you — in a dimly-lit room during such a party for example, has become a legendary gamer meme in its own right). K acknowledges a fascination among young people in memorializing the phenomenon, but the parties are today still mostly hosted and attended “IRL” by people who remember what the experience was like the first time around.“We’ve kind of lost a lot of control, I think over our relationship to technology,” K said. “We have lost a lot of privacy as well. There’s less of a sense of exploration because there just isn’t as much out there.”"

        "title": "Inside the many, many glamorous homes owned by fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Fashion writer Patrick Mauriès first met Karl Lagerfeld in 1981, after he quoted the fashion designer in a short book he had written about contemporary fashion and culture. Although Lagerfeld had by that time already designed for the luxury houses Chloé and Fendi, he was not the iconic figure he would become later in life, particularly after he joined Chanel as creative director in 1983 — a role he held until his death in 2019. As his star rose, he and Mauriès remained good friends, with the writer enjoying rare glimpses into parts of Lagerfeld’s private life and way of living at his many lavish properties over the years.“Everything was absolute luxury. Even when you went for a small lunch with him, the napkins were embroidered,” said Mauriès, recalling how Lagerfeld was one of the first people he knew to use Diptyque candles at home — but never just one of them, of course. “There would be 20 candles in the staircase leading to the dining room, and so it was a very high luxury feeling.”The full extent of this tirelessly-curated “high luxury” is revealed in the new book “Karl Lagerfeld: A Life in Houses,” with an introduction by Mauriès and accompanying texts about each home by Marie Kalt, a former editor of “Architectural Digest France.” Featuring rarely-seen images of 13 of Lagerfeld’s properties in Europe — spanning Paris, Monte Carlo, Rome, Hamburg and more — the book reveals a lesser-known side to the designer, and provides insight into his sense of style when it came to interior design.Each property was decorated in a different, distinctive way. Lagerfeld’s early Parisian home on the Rue de l’Université — an apartment on the second floor of an 18th-century mansion he shared with his mother in the 1960s and ‘70s — was filled with Art Deco furniture and homeware, from the sofas to the cocktail glasses.In 1977, Lagerfeld moved into the 18th-century Hôtel Pozzo di Borgo in Paris, with his residence — or residences, rather, as he moved at various points between different parts of the building — evoking the grandeur and spirit of the Age of Enlightenment with ornate tapestries and gilded detailing in many of the rooms. “He was playing all the time with the spirit of the place,” said Mauriès, adding that some of the only common threads in Lagerfeld’s interiors were nods to his German heritage.In the Monte Carlo residence he bought in the 1980s, Lagerfeld was drawn to the Memphis Group design school, a collective of designers founded by Italian architect Ettore Sottsass that made use of bold colors, geometry and playfulness. Lagerfeld’s residence in his German hometown of Hamburg, named Vila Jako after his long-term companion Jacques de Bascher, was bought in the early 1990s; Lagerfeld then filled its interiors with objects including vases from the Swedish Grace design movement, which was a bridge between Art Nouveau and Modernism.“It was always changing from one atmosphere to another, from antiquarian interiors to ultra-modern ones,” said Mauriès of Lagerfeld’s design aesthetic, having visited many of his properties over the years, particularly those in Paris. “He’s a singularity in that there is no unity in his type of decoration.”And, as Mauriès explained, while Lagerfeld derived inspiration from the past, a sense of change and forward momentum was an inherent part of his creative practice. “What was essential for him was to live in the present tense or the present times. Once he thought something was a bit outdated or not of the moment, he discarded it and put it in storage,” said Mauriès. “He was always moving, he couldn’t imagine himself stuck in a period or style.”In fact, Mauriès compared Lagerfeld’s approach to decorating each home as almost like designing a theater set, as the designer became completely immersed in the details and minutiae of one space at a time. “And then when it was done, he lost a bit of interest, and went on to create another one.”In a way, this process of reinvention was also an embodiment of Lagerfeld’s fashion design, from one season to the next, and the evolution of his own image and sense of personal style.As Lagerfeld became more of a public figure in the 1990s and 2000s, he increasingly sought homes that could act as retreats, said Mauriès. “It was something he needed to refocus and recreate himself… He needed these lairs in which to work.”In keeping with Lagerfeld’s constant need for change, there is little left of the homes and interiors featured in the book. The designer sold many of the properties while he was still alive, and dispersed or bequeathed items he had collected in various ways, including by auction. A sale at Sotheby’s in 1991 saw Lagerfeld’s collection of 133 Memphis Group items go under the hammer, with a dressing table and matching stool designed by American postmodernist architect Michael Graves reaching 150,000 francs (then about $26,000, or around $59,000 in today’s money). A posthumous auction of objects from Lagerfeld’s estate, including his sketches, clothing and furniture, meanwhile, consisted of 1,200 lots assembled from five of his residences in and around Paris and Monaco.Only one place that Lagerfeld called home has been preserved as it was when he lived there: the 7L bookshop and photo studio that he set up in 1999 in the Rue de Lille in Paris. The property was acquired by Chanel in 2001, and today acts as an homage to the designer. In his lifetime, Lagerfeld was known for his love of books, amassing huge collections and creating libraries in his residences. Today, the bookshop hosts regular public events and offers a library curation service for bibliophiles looking to build their own reading rooms at home.“Everything disappeared — it’s a strange destiny,” said Mauriès. “But that follows his way of living. He was not interested in keeping memories or having these really private and intimate places preserved.”Indeed, Lagerfeld’s own words quoted in the book outline this philosophy: “The most beautiful house is always the next one.”"

        "title": "Witty, sexy, low cost and low brow: The enduring appeal of Pop art",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "As accidental adverts for art shows go, a giant pooch made of flowers is a crowd pleaser. Outside the Guggenheim Bilbao in northern Spain, Jeff Koons’ much-loved flower 1992 sculpture “Puppy,” shows how Pop art — that high kick of counter-intuitive artistic expression so often equated with the 1960s — never really went away.It’s appropriate then, that Koons’ monumental 43ft-high Highland Terrier made of 38,000 bedding plants sits faithfully — and spectacularly — outside the museum’s new show “Signs and Objects: Pop Art from the Guggenheim Collection.”The exhibition both celebrates and deconstructs Pop – the artistic movement that reframed everything from comics to product packaging as high art in a mashup of Dada, Surrealism and, some would say, chicanery. The show delivers bombastic examples by many of the old masters — Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg — while pondering whether Pop has a place in today’s cultural landscape.Curators present Warhol’s silkscreened electric chairs — “When you see a gruesome picture over and over again, it doesn’t really have any effect,” he once remarked — and Lichtenstein’s cartoonish studies using Ben Day dots. But there are also whimsical works from the 1990s and 2000s by Claes Oldenburg and Maurizio Cattelan (who presents a bitterly comic sculpture of Pinocchio drowned in a pond), and more recent politically minded pieces by contemporary artists such as Lucia Hierro, whose work addresses cultural identity as much as the effects of capitalism and consumerism. The Pop baton has been handed over numerous times in art history.The Guggenheim Museum was pivotal to the development of the movement, both in terms of its fame and its art historical importance. In 1963 it staged the New York exhibition “Six Painters and the Object” in which works by Warhol, Lichtenstein and Rauschenberg joined those of Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist and Jim Dine in their museum debut, solidifying the artists’ scholarly importance. And the museum has been collecting in the field ever since.The Bilbao show includes 40 works, dating from 1961 to 2021. The largest,“Soft Shuttlecock” (1995) by Claes Oldenburg and his wife Coosje van Bruggen, was specifically created for the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed rotunda of the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan. In Bilbao, the monstrous shuttlecock with its flaccid feathers sits in its own space like a sad echo of an ancient badminton game between giants. Pop can be funny and melancholy at the same time.The show is primarily spread over two main galleries, the first showing large-format high-sheen works by, primarily American A-listers — including a huge green self portrait of Warhol looking like the Wicked Witch of the West — while the second shifts the focus to European artists, such as Mimmo Rotella and Sigmar Polke). Audiences move from the “new, shiny” realm of a young country to the regions with “long histories”, notes Lauren Hinkson, who has co-curated the Bilbao exhibition with fellow Guggenheim scholar Joan Young.Pop has become synonymous with the stuff of shop shelves and self-promotion. So, is it partly responsible for today’s rabid consumerism and narcissism? “Sure,” says Hinkson. “Andy Warhol chief among them. He did it before anyone had thought to do it, before the Kardashians even thought to take a selfie. Warhol anticipated all of that.” Those original Pop pioneers, she notes, “turned a mirror back on the culture, they made the public self-aware.” And today, she adds, contemporary artists are injecting wit into the mix. “But it’s an incredibly dark read.” Poor old Pinocchio is a case in point.In the exhibition entrance, “A Little Bit of Everything (2017-21)” by the Dominican American contemporary artist Lucía Hierro, highlights the potential of Pop to be both critical and culturally specific. Hierro has created a giant shopping bag full of Latin-American groceries that briefly baffles audience’s sense of scale. The work, created in collaboration with her late mother Lucía Guzmán García, features a selection of oversized felt replicas of Dominican products, all jumbled together. It’s a strange melding of the personal, political and whimsical.Talking from her studio in New York, Hierro explains how she brings an outsider’s perspective on the movement, blending politics – in particular discussions of colonialism – and family lore into an aesthetic often thought of as universal and generic. “I see myself in an interesting position as a Dominican American and Spanish-speaking Caribbean to confront and analyze my place within these systems, within the visual analysis we call ‘Pop’.”Like many of the works on view in ‘Signs and Objects’, Hierro’s work is as playful as it is profound. “I’ve always loved humor in art,” says Hierro. “Humor is a great way to engage with each other, especially when wanting to broach heavier subjects. It’s not passive like entertainment; it’s collaborative.” Outside the museum, Koons’ giant hound of marigolds and begonias punctuates her point perfectly. As people pass, they giggle and get their Instagram snaps. Pop was never going to get just 15 minutes of fame."

        "title": "How this dream-like photo challenges notions of the male gaze",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A group of men lie at the foot of a sofa, their naked bodies peeking out through a carpet of rose petals. Some look toward the photograph’s protagonist, an Asian woman in a lime green dress laying across the cushioned loveseat. Others gaze away, seemingly indifferent, as if caught in some sort of hazy spell.Despite Chinese photographer Yushi Li’s gentle staging, her title for the photograph, “The Smothering Dream,” suggests something more sinister is at play. Referencing Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema’s 1888 work “The Roses of Heliogabalus,” in which a Roman emperor watches on as unsuspecting banquet guests slowly suffocate in flowers, Li’s modern take — shot on a set awash with pastel colors and delicate furniture — is equally deceptive at first glance.Li, is not only the photographer, but also the muse at the center of the image. “I made this very pink and kitsch dream,” she said, describing the London living room set in a phone interview. “But underneath it, there is, like, some kind of violence. It’s a fantasy of love and eroticism… smothering these men I desire.”Shot in 2022, “The Smothering Dream” was recently on show at Photofairs Shanghai as part of a group exhibition called “A Quiet Gaze.” It was a fitting title to showcase the work of an artist for whom an examination of the male and female gazes has been a recurring theme.Li’s wider portfolio of subversive images include softly-lit nude portraits of strangers she scouted through a dating app (a series titled “My Tinder Boys”). Stripped of their clothes and therefore their character, she said, the men lounge around their homes doing banal tasks: one scoops out of a fresh watermelon, while another casually balances a plate of spaghetti over his private parts.The series is partly a response to erotic images objectifying women that are historically ubiquitous in art, advertisements and photography. Although a canon of male nudes does exist, it largely comprises images shot by gay male photographers. When Li began the series in 2017, she noticed a lack of images depicting naked men as objects of desire from a woman’s perspective.After some mistook her work as being shot by a male photographer, she began inserting herself into the photos — fully clothed alongside naked counterparts, and often the only person looking directly at the camera.“Instead of being a passive, ‘looked-at’ thing, I want to be the one who is in control, who is creating the story, who is expressing my fantasy,” said Li.Her images have also pushed back against the longstanding fetishization of Asian women, often by Western men, something Li said she has experienced first-hand: “I’m a small person, and come across as quiet, so I kind of fit the stereotype.” Li, who was born in China’s Hunan province and now lives in the UK.She said she feels flattered when women reach out to her online to say they feel empowered by her photographs. “As a woman, especially as an Asian or Chinese woman, you (should be able to) feel that you can also express your erotic desire.”Li has been fascinated with how the idea of the gaze has, today, become “less binary.” She has also been examining and playing with the way classical paintings depict power dynamics, portrayals of desire and representations of the body.She brings these ideas into “Paintings, Dreams and Love,” an ongoing project to which “The Smothering Dream” belongs. (A second photo from the same shoot, entitled “After the Dream,” hints at what has just taken place, with satin cushions and wilted petals strewn about the scene).Other sources of inspiration include Swiss painter Henry Fuseli’s 1781 “The Nightmare,” showing an incubus crouching menacingly atop a sleeping woman, and “The Death of Actaeon,” Renaissance painter Titian’s 16th-century oil painting of the Romans’ goddess of the hunt, Diana, transforming the Theban hero into a stag that is then killed by his own hounds.In Li’s reinterpretations, she is in full control. In the former, she wears a tight, red turtleneck as she casually sits on an unsuspecting male figure, thwarting the idea of seduction. In the latter, she strikes a calm, calculated pose, pointing a bow and arrow at a naked man in a window.But control, Li says, is subjective in images where multiple gazes can co-exist. “Some of these men (in the photographs) also look at me, and the viewer also looks at all of us,” she said. The internet age, she added, has only further complicated matters. “Now you can look at so many things like instantly, everywhere, or wherever, whenever you want… it’s something very different, it’s not (just) a physical thing, it’s a digital thing.“There’s also the gaze from the algorithm, and the gaze from the screen that reflects yourself when you look at it… the internet (means) we’re subjected to the gaze more, in a way.”"

        "title": "Google opens New York headquarters in repurposed 1930s railway terminal",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Google is set to open its New York headquarters in a repurposed 1930s railway terminus near Hudson Square on Monday — and the tech giant says the project was designed with nature in mind.The 12-story St. John’s Terminal building, located at the nexus of Hudson River Park, the West Village, SoHo and Tribeca, is being billed as a “workplace designed for teams,” but it’s also providing a new home for local flora and fauna.With 1.5 acres of street-level vegetation, rail bed gardens and terraces that are 95% made up of plants native to New York State, the habitat created by the project has attracted more than 40 bird species, “including birds fueling up for a trans-Atlantic migratory flight,” wrote Google’s president for Americas and Global Business, Sean Downey, in an open letter on Wednesday.“It’s actually re-knitting the ecosystem, from the insects to the birds,” said Rick Cook, a founding partner at CookFox Architects, one of the design firms behind the project, in an introductory video published by Google.Once at the end of the railway now forming New York’s High Line, St. John’s Terminal served as a freight facility and office space. The renovation retained the original rail beds, turning them into planters that hang above the building’s main entrance, and incorporated wood reclaimed from the Coney Island boardwalk after Hurricane Sandy. Google said that the decision to repurpose an old building, rather than constructing its new headquarters from scratch, saved 78,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions (equivalent to taking around 17,000 cars off the road for a year). The tech giant also claimed it had prevented 77% of its construction waste from ending up in landfills.The complex is one of several Google offices built in renovated structures, including a converted flour mill in Dublin, a former aircraft hangar in LA’s Playa Vista neighborhood and Pier 57, once a New York City shipping terminal. The tech firm also owns the nearby Chelsea Market, purchased for $2.4 billion in 2018 after it had been converted into a retail and office development.Google began leasing the St. John’s Terminal site in 2019, and bought it outright in 2022 for $2.1 billion. The building serves as a headquarters for Google’s Global Business Organization, which includes the firm’s sales and partnership teams.The renovation project was commissioned in 2018, before the Covid-19 pandemic, but its final design was later adapted to offer more flexible work arrangements. Google, like many large corporations in America, is trying to entice workers back to the office, and the new campus — whose interiors were designed by international architecture studio Gensler — is being heralded by the tech giant as a place to connect and innovate.“If you’re going to make that commute in, it should be because you can work with people that have passion, that have ideas, that you can sit next to and come up with something that you couldn’t do just on your own, and that’s really the vision of this space,” said Downey in a video introducing the new campus.The building can accommodate around 3,000 workers and is organized into 60 “neighborhoods” for teams of around 20 to 50 people. There are no assigned desks but instead workers can use flexible seating areas or shared spaces including lounges, cafes, terraces and micro-kitchens.“Creativity wants to move around, so we’ve created as much common spaces as we have neighborhood space, if not more, for people to meet, to work, to collaborate,” said Jennifer Kelly, a vice president of workplace experience, in the same video. “Some feel like a library, some feel like a coffee shop, so people have options to use spaces that they feel most comfortable in.”There are currently more than 14,000 Google employees in New York, up from 7,000 when the company announced the St. John’s Terminal project in 2018, despite sweeping layoffs across several divisions earlier in this year. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, also slashed around 12,000 jobs — then around 6% of its workforce — at the beginning of 2023."

        "title": "A new documentary wrestles with the highlights — and lowlights — of John Galliano’s controversial career",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "After a first intervention for the fashion house’s seismic creative director John Galliano failed, Dior’s then-CEO Sidney Toledano staged a second, more serious one. It was February 2011, shortly before Galliano was set to debut what would become his final collection for Dior at Paris Fashion Week, and the designer was summoned to appear before Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH, Dior’s parent company.In their conversation, Arnault stressed that if Galliano did not stop binge drinking, he would die. In response, as Toledano recounts in the new documentary “High & Low: John Galliano,” the then-50-year-old gym-obsessive ripped open his shirt to reveal a rippling torso and said, “Does this look like the body of an alcoholic?”And so the designer’s drinking and pill-popping rolled on. But just days before the Paris Fashion Week show, Galliano was accused of making antisemitic comments at fashionable watering hole La Perle, in the French capital’s Jewish quarter. Video of a second, separate incident at the bar — filmed a few months earlier — then surfaced in British tabloid “The Sun.” It showed a visibly inebriated Galliano verbally accosting patrons, spewing antisemitic insults and saying, to nobody in particular, “I love Hitler.”Galliano was swiftly fired by Dior and disgraced in the global press. (His final collection was shown without him.) He was found guilty in court of two counts of antisemitic behavior; after paying a 6,000 euro (then $8,415) fine, he decamped to a remote location to find solace. For years, he remained largely out of the spotlight.But in the annals of contemporary “cancel culture,” Galliano’s downfall — though it predated the phenomenon by some years — is an entry that perhaps warrants closer inspection. At least, “High & Low” director Kevin Macdonald, whose documentary performs a thrilling autopsy of Galliano’s career collapse, thinks so.“During lockdown, I’d been reading (about) everybody being canceled, one after another. And it set me to thinking about forgiveness and when and how people are forgiven,” Macdonald told CNN. “Somebody mentioned to me, ‘What about Galliano?’”A friend introduced him to Galliano, and once he saw the designer’s desire to tell his side of the story, Macdonald approached Anna Wintour — Galliano’s “protector,” the Scottish filmmaker said — for her blessing. (Wintour even agreed to appear in the documentary herself.)“One of the things I’ve (encountered), particularly in the US, is people who were like, ‘I don’t want to see a film about an anti-Semite,’” Macdonald said. “I’m like, ‘Well, I don’t know if he is. Maybe he’s not. But shouldn’t we try and understand him and shouldn’t we try and see where that came from?’“I’m not put off by moral ambiguity and complex characters. And that was the thing that made me interested in John — there aren’t easy answers.”As its title suggests, “High & Low” scrutinizes the designer’s extraordinary rise and dramatic flameout. Seemingly addicted to ambition and paid to conjure, in clothes, exotic dreams and transportive visions, Galliano appears to have been peeled away from reality like a shell from a boiled egg. At his creative height, he was producing more than 30 collections a year across both Dior and his namesake label. His assistants had assistants. He did not personally know how to use an ATM. “After every collection, he would crash. He would totally crash,” Johann Brun, an early financial backer of the Galliano label, says in the film.“On the surface, John was told, ‘Do you want to take over the advertising of the perfume? Do you want to take over the watches?’” Macdonald said. “John, being an obsessive control freak, would be like, ‘Yes, yes, yes.’”“I was committing suicide slowly,” Galliano admits at one point in the documentary. “I just wanted to sleep forever.”In one standout scene, Galliano recounts his father’s passing, three days before a Dior Haute Couture show. Toledano proffered a jet to fly Galliano to the burial — and return that same evening, so he could resume fittings.“There’s a madness to it,” Macdonald said of the incident, adding: “And you can see that at the end of that show, where he’s totally drunk and he’s being allowed to give an interview in his office. He’s devastated because his father’s dead, but he’s conflicted because he didn’t think he liked his father. He keeps going about how grateful he is to Mr. Toledano for sending a jet… And you’re thinking, ‘It doesn’t actually sound that great that you didn’t have time off.’ But I would say that if you’d asked John then, he would say, ‘I don’t want time off. I want to keep working.’”That work is on full display throughout “High & Low” — the Victorian princesses, the roving gypsies and the “Eskimo and Mongolian hotties,” as Galliano described them in the stage notes for his Fall-Winter 2002 show “Esquimaux.” Perhaps no other fashion documentary has used archival footage so fittingly to illustrate the madcap genius of a figure whom fashion critic Tim Blanks once referred to as “the Cecil B. DeMille of fashion.”Returning to a place of trust and acceptance in the fashion industry required Galliano to take a pilgrimage of penance. As part of his years-long quest for reconciliation, the designer met with Jewish people — including a rabbi and a holocaust survivor — who could help him understand the gravity of his offensive comments.Galliano hoped that, through this atonement, he would be given a second chance — and he was. Still, Macdonald would like his audience to remember that his outbursts had direct victims, one of whom he interviews in the film and who decidedly does not forgive Galliano. (“That was shocking and surprising to me — that the real victim of this actually has been forgotten,” the filmmaker said.) But he offers, without judgment, all one needs to come to their own conclusion about this public figure and his very public failings.It was Kate Moss who first brought Galliano back into the fashion fold, asking him to design a wedding dress for her 2011 marriage to Jamie Hince. His first official post-Dior position was as designer-in-residence at Oscar de la Renta in 2013; he was installed as creative director at Maison Margiela the following year. His collections received some attention, though the sartorial theatrics he was known for were tamped down to match the house’s avant-garde approach.It wasn’t until Galliano’s recent Spring-Summer 2024 Haute Couture collection for Margiela that he made a cultural impact equivalent to that of his halcyon days, reviving the iconic Brassaï doll aesthetic he previously presented at Dior’s Fall-Winter show in 2007. Men and women were cinched at the waist, teetering on heels, bursting with padding and furnished with chest plates; faces were glazed over by makeup artist Pat McGrath to create a porcelain finish.“I want to take all the credit, of course,” Macdonald said jokingly of the collection, Galliano’s first since filming wrapped.Before one of Galliano’s regular interviews for the film, Macdonald showed the designer a series of clips from his previous fashion shows “He started to shake, uncomfortable and nervous, smoking… He said, ‘It takes me back to the feeling of obsession that I was in the grip of then, which connects to the addiction. It connects to the excess and the bad behavior,’” the director recalled. “There was something really tragic about it. We’re looking at it going, ‘Wow, that’s crazy. It’s beautiful.’ And he’s looking at it, and it’s actually making him feel sick.”“I think there was something cathartic about making the film — talking about all of this in great detail, knowing that it was going to be in public, watching the interviews that I did with other people — that has allowed him to move on from it in a way that maybe he hadn’t before,” Macdonald said of Galliano, who has not commented publicly on the film. “But you’d have to ask him.”"

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Beyoncé has revealed she will be launching a hair care line on February 20. The 29-time Grammy winner made the announcement on Instagram, posting a cryptic video featuring apparent home movie footage of her mother’s salon Headliners, in Houston, Texas — where Beyoncé had her first job sweeping hair.A makeshift projector screen shows snippets of childhood videos; Beyoncé in a pink tracksuit wandering the salon floor, Tina Knowles dressed up for the evening, waving to the camera with her young daughter in tow, sporting a flourishing afro. “Hair is sacred,” read Beyoncé’s caption as she revealed the brand name, Cécred.Intermixed with her family’s archival footage are clips of hair washing, braiding and silk presses. Tina Knowles influence on her daughters career has been far-reaching — one of the first music videos Destiny’s Child shot was for their first number one hit “Bills, Bills, Bills,” (1999), a tale of a disillusioned, independent woman triumphantly cutting off the deadweight of her boyfriend. It was staged in a hairdressers.“There is power in community, and I saw that growing up the daughter of a salon owner,” Beyoncé told Harper’s Bazaar in 2021. “I was exposed to so many entrepreneurial women that I admired. Doctors, business owners, artists, teachers, mothers — they all came through my mom’s salon. I saw firsthand how a salon can be a sanctuary for women.”“I’ve seen how much Black women’s emotions are attached to our hair and beauty,” she told the magazine. “The beauty industry does not always understand these emotions and what we need. I want to build a community where women of all races can communicate and share some of those secrets, so we can continue to support and take care of each other. I want to give women a space to feel their own strength and tell their stories. That is power.”While details about what products Cécred will offer are yet to be shared, a trademark request filed in the summer of 2022 clears the company for production of hair care preparations, candles, vitamin supplements, electric hair styling tools, combs, hair accessories, pillow cases and four other goods and services categories.While the launch date is now imminent, keen fans of Beyoncé may recall that she teased this venture in May last year, telling her followers on Instagram about how she watched her mother at work: “Having learned so much on my hair journey, I’ve always dreamt of carrying on her legacy.”Beyoncé is not the first celebrity to recently enter the world of hair care. In 2019, Tracee Ellis Ross launched Pattern, a now-award winning natural hair line focused on “curl conscious and textured” customers. Two years later, “Friends” star Jennifer Aniston – whose shiny, face-framing layers became known as “The Rachel” haircut on TikTok – launched a line of vegan and cruelty free hair products called LolaVie."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "The FBI has returned a trove of looted Japanese art to its country of origin after a family found a stash of artifacts in their late father’s Massachusetts attic.The family of a deceased World War II veteran contacted the FBI after discovering the items, which they determined to be “very valuable Asian art,” while sorting through his personal effects. The man had never served in the Pacific theater, according to the FBI.“There were some scrolls, there were some pottery pieces, there was an ancient map. They looked old and valuable,” Special Agent Geoffrey J. Kelly, art crime coordinator for FBI Boston and a member of the FBI Art Crime Team, said in a statement.“And because of this, they did a little research and they determined that at least the scrolls had been entered about 20 years ago in the FBI’s National Stolen Art File.”Among the items were six 18th-19th-century painted scrolls, an ornate 19th-century hand-drawn map of Japan’s fifth largest island, Okinawa, and pottery and ceramics that included plates, bowls and teapots.When unfurled and studied at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Asian Art in Washington, D.C., the scrolls showed colorful portraits of Okinawan royalty.A typewritten letter found alongside the artifacts in Massachusetts helped confirm they were looted during the last days of World War II, the FBI added.“When taken together, they really represent a substantial piece of Okinawan history,” Kelly said of the artifacts.“A nation’s cultural identity is really summed up in the artifacts and the history,” he said.“This is what makes a culture. And without it, you’re taking away their history. And the surest way to eliminate a culture is to eliminate their past. And so, it’s really important for us as stewards of artifacts and cultural patrimony to make every effort that we can to see that these go back to the civilizations and the cultures in the countries where they belong,” Kelly added.The artifacts were returned to Okinawa last week, the FBI said, but noted that several Okinawan objects are still missing and are listed in the National Stolen Art File."

        "title": "New sanctions on Russian diamonds will change the global trade in gems",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "After close to two years of conflict, the global diamond market is set to feel the full consequences of the war in Ukraine.The European Union earlier this month added the world’s biggest diamond producer, Russia’s Alrosa, to its sanctions list alongside its CEO, Pavel Alekseevich Marinychev. The new year marked the start of an escalating series of export restrictions on Russian stones coordinated with the G7, which includes the US, UK, Canada and Japan, as well as EU members France, Germany and Italy.Though some countries had already imposed their own sanctions, figuring out a comprehensive system to effectively police the market proved challenging; diamond traders in Antwerp, the Belgian port city that serves as a major trading hub for the precious stones, had lobbied to slow restrictions on the lucrative business. But now that a sanctions scheme has been agreed, it stands to push through seismic changes in the way the diamond industry operates, imposing new requirements for transparency and traceability in a sector that has historically operated with little of either.“These sanctions have been in the works for two years now and it took this long because it’s that challenging to come up with a framework that everyone in the industry can effectively adhere to,” said diamond industry analyst Paul Zimnisky.Though the US and UK banned direct imports of rough diamonds from Russia shortly after the war began, stones cut and polished elsewhere in the world had remained fair game — until now.But as of the start of January, EU and G7 countries have banned the direct purchase of non-industrial diamonds from Russia. This move will be followed by further restrictions on the import of Russian diamonds processed in third countries starting in March. And come September, diamonds sold within the powerful group of countries will need to adhere to a certification scheme to verify where they came from. In Europe, jewelry and watches containing diamonds will be included too.In other words, even if stones are sent halfway around the world for cutting and polishing, if they originated in Russia they’ll be banned from markets in Europe and the G7. And the industry will need to figure out how to prove it.No one seems to really know yet. Diamond supply chains are long and complicated, with stones typically passing through dozens of hands in multiple countries before making it to market.Keeping track of where stones originated while navigating this web of hard-to-police middlemen is notoriously difficult. That’s particularly true for the smaller diamonds Russia is known for producing, which are typically sold in large quantities and often mixed with other stones from other places.So far, the EU and G7 have only painted a broad outline of their plans for a system to trace and verify stones’ origins, with a pilot system set to be operational at the beginning of March. Industry groups including the World Diamond Council, Antwerp World Diamond Centre, the Gem and Jewellery Export Council of India and the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) have been working together to develop an effective solution.“It’s a bit of a work in progress,” said Morgane Winterholer, general manager of strategic brands and sustainability diamond manufacturer Dimexon. “At the moment it is extremely important that the roadmap needs to be developed.”Technology could help. The GIA is able to triangulate data gathered from a rough stone and match it to finished diamonds, but still relies on documentation of where the stone came from to begin with. De Beers has developed a blockchain based traceability system known as Tracr, while other companies are developing their own offerings.But none of these solutions are operating at scale and there’s currently no scientific method to trace a diamond right back to the mine.The new sanctions will dramatically accelerate efforts to build traceability into the diamond industry, in a way that will restructure supply chains that stretch around the world.Big businesses have been preparing for the change. LVMH-owned Tiffany and Richemont both said they stopped sourcing Russian stones shortly after the war in Ukraine broke out. Dimexon has segregated its supply chain to ensure Russian stones don’t reach Western clients, tracking each transaction and relying on direct commercial relationships with mining companies to demonstrate the origin of each package of stones.These changes have market ramifications too. Russia accounts for roughly one third of the world’s diamond supply, but while Russian stones will likely still end up sparkling in engagement rings, necklaces and tennis bracelets bought by consumers in places outside of the new sanctions regime, the countries that will adhere to the diamond ban account for nearly three quarters of global jewelry demand, according to Zimnisky.“In the medium- to longer-term, there will be times the industry runs into supply shortages because of this,” he said.This article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

        "title": "This photo of male intimacy in 1980s India was more subversive than it seems",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "To passersby, the sight of two men embracing besides New Delhi’s India Gate in 1986 might have seemed unremarkable. In a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace, it was photographer Sunil Gupta who attracted more attention at the time.“Men holding hands or lying in each other’s laps is not an issue — it looks very romantic from (the outside), but they’re usually just hanging out,” he said in a video interview from the UK, before recalling: “I was creating more interest than them, because I was standing there with a tripod and a camera, so everybody was focused on me.”Onlookers may not have realized, but Gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he has described as the “repressive atmosphere” of 1980s India. At a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today — and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an “unnatural offense” — the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting Delhi’s gay scene. The pair in question had chosen the war monument’s gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot.Having lived in New Delhi until his mid-teens, London-based Gupta knew this from personal experience. “I passed that place on my way to school every day for 11 years,” he said. “You just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home. It was very easy.”The image forms part of the photographer’s series “Exiles,” which was first exhibited in the UK in 1987 but is this week showing at the India Art Fair in New Delhi. Primarily shot outdoors around India’s capital, it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners, their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera.Concerned about “outing” his subjects, Gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a “constructed documentary” approach. After shooting his images and developing the film in London, he returned to Delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show.“There was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures,” he said of the India Gate shoot. “And there were other photos that were (more suggestive)… So I picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series.”The other ethical challenge, he recalled, was communicating to the duo how the images would be used — and the art of photography itself.“It wasn’t for publication, and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine, so it took some explaining,” he said, adding: “Then I tried to explain the process.”Photography for many at the time, Gupta observed, was still “a very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom.”Now among India’s most celebrated photographic artists, Gupta often addressed LGBTQ experiences in his explorations of race, immigration and identity. While studying in the US in the mid-1970s he produced a now-celebrated series of photos from New York’s Christopher Street that captured the city’s gay scene in the years between the Stonewall Riots and onset of the AIDS epidemic.Although “Exiles” presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the West, Gupta’s intended audience was always back in London. Homophobia was rife in 1980s Britain, and the photographer said he faced “a lot of hostility” at art school for making work relating to his sexuality.“I couldn’t make gay work, and I couldn’t make gay work about India, especially,” he said. “There was none in the library for reference. So, I thought, ‘I’m making it my mission to make some. Not for India, but for this canon — we need to have gay Indian guys in our library, in our art schools, over here.’”New York’s Museum of Modern Art has since acquired several of the pictures for its permanent collection, signifying the series’ place in contemporary photography. But it was not an instant success.“It didn’t have any impact when it was first shown,” Gupta said of its debut. “I think it was too early.”By the 1990s, however, interest in Gupta’s work was growing, as art made by, and about, gay people of color became increasingly visible in the West. The fact that “Exiles” is now showing in India, where he said it is positively received, is testament to changes on the subcontinent, too.Although the country’s LGBTQ communities still face significant social stigma, gay sex was decriminalized in 2018 and the arrival of apps like Grindr have been transformative, Gupta said. (“Those sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening — or maybe happening less,” he added). This modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light.“I think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before Grindr and the internet,” Gupta said. “People think it was all doom and gloom, and people jumping off buildings. They don’t seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then.”This is a message reflected in the photographer’s carefree India Gate shoot, which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight.“It just seemed very pleasurable. It was a nice day out, and I got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh.”“Exiles” is showing via Vadehra Art Gallery at India Art Fair, which runs February 9-12 in New Delhi, India. A book of outtakes from the series, published by Aperture, is available now."

        "title": "Big, bold and made of concrete: Why these European churches defy tradition",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "Growing up in the UK, photographer Jamie McGregor Smith was familiar with traditional churches and their historic architecture. But in 2018, when McGregor Smith and his family moved to Vienna, Austria, he noticed cathedrals and churches across Europe built in a 20th century brutalist style.Intrigued, McGregor Smith planned a series of train journeys across Europe to find out more about these modernist places of worship. Over four years, McGregor Smith photographed close to 200 churches across eight countries, all designed and constructed in the 1960s and 1970s. “Even though (the churches) are now 50 years old, they still have this feeling of transporting you to some timeless space in the future,” McGregor Smith said in an interview with CNN.The result of this photographic pilgrimage is a new book, “Sacred Modernity: The Holy Embrace of Modernist Architecture,” featuring 139 photographs from these awe-inspiring buildings — feats of sculpture, engineering and architecture as much as structures created for a spiritual purpose.These include the concrete triangular motifs of the Templo Mariano di Monte Grisa, Trieste, Italy, completed in 1965; the cavernous, minimalist interiors of Christi Auferstehung Kirche in Cologne, Germany, completed in 1970, and aerial views of the concertina-like structure of Mehrzweckhalle der Schulschwestern in Graz, Austria, completed in 1979.“Churches always try to create this alternate reality, so when you step in, you appreciate the power beyond the everyday experience,” said McGregor Smith, whose photographs from the project are also currently being exhibited at TU Wien (Vienna University of Technology). “You are almost stepping into a psychedelic reality.”The traditional institution of the church may not seem like the most natural partner for modernist architecture, yet the impact and legacy of World War II provides important social and historical context for their emergence. At the Second Vatican Council, bishops from across the Catholic world met in Vatican City between 1962 and 1965, and discussed ways in which the church could move forward to adapt to an increasingly changing world. One of the topics was the architectural design of the church.“Both Catholic and evangelical churches wanted to look forward to a brighter, more optimistic future,” said McGregor Smith. “After the trauma of the war, there were many young priests wanting to work with the best and brightest modernist architects.”The results of these collaborations bear some commonalities, as McGregor Smith highlights in the text accompanying his photographs. Many of the churches photographed are constructed from, or heavily feature concrete — both a cheap material, and one architects were using to experiment with and test out pioneering new designs.“(The architects) are using the expressiveness of concrete where you can create forms and shapes that have never been possible before. You can pull and push space in and out of a frame and create a reality that’s never been possible in normal architecture or normal design,” said McGregor Smith.“That’s what I love about a lot of these buildings; how difficult and how unreal they seem. This, I think, is to push people into forgetting the normal day-to-day, and for them to appreciate a reality beyond what their senses can normally deliver.”McGregor Smith referred to apophatic architecture; the idea that human language and concepts can’t fully capture the greatness of God, and so it was the task of the architect to use visual language and design to describe the indescribable. The use of negative space, playfulness with light and dark, and sense of omniscience then played important roles in the design of these churches.And McGregor Smith as the photographer too faced a similar challenge in capturing these spaces on camera. “Everyone in a way is trying to express the inexpressible, or trying to somehow capture a glimpse of something beautiful and powerful that normal words can’t.”As he was photographing the churches that form the “Sacred Modernity” project, McGregor Smith recalled how they were often quiet, without large crowds or congregations that they would have once held.“I liked photographing the empty stillness of these places. For me, it’s a shame that these wonderful, architectural icons are really underappreciated and uninhabited,” said McGregor Smith, adding that he would often attend the end of mass, with no-one else present.“This design period was a way of bringing people back to the church and reforming its image. Now we are in a position where these churches are mostly empty.”In an increasingly secularized Europe then, the churches of “Sacred Modernity” reflect the institution’s past, present and future all at once. For McGregor Smith, these spaces present possibilities to engage societies in different ways — with religion, with design, and with each other.But, much like the very emergence of post-war modernist churches, this requires adaptation. “Religion is, by design, fashion conscious. The church always has to stay current, otherwise the parishioners will walk away without them.”"

        "text": "A Roman statue dating back almost 2,000 years has been discovered by construction workers building a parking lot in the United Kingdom.Digger driver Greg Crawley uncovered the marble head of a Roman lady at 16th century country estate Burghley House in Peterborough, England, last year while undertaking renovation works.Two weeks later, a bust was also found close to the site of the original find, and the relics were cleaned, examined and reassembled by a conservator, who dated the sculpture to the 1st century or 2nd century.Experts noted that an iron dowel had been added to the statue, allowing it to be attached to a bust or pedestal – an adaptation which was historically carried out by Italian dealers in antiquities during the late 18th century when selling items to aristocrats traveling in Italy.“It is believed that it was during one of the ninth Earl’s two tours to Italy in the 1760s, when he purchased many antiquities, that he brought the sculpture back to Burghley,” the house said in a statement.Brownlow Cecil, the ninth Earl of Exeter, inherited the title in 1754 and was an avid traveler and collector of fine art, according to the estate.However, the estate is unsure how the head and bust ended up buried by soil in the car park, calling it a “complete mystery.”Burghley House noted that “explanations rang[e] from a bungled burglary to someone simply discarding the statue and it later being covered by soil.”Digger driver Crawley said it was an “amazing feeling to have found something so old and special” and called the find his “best ever discovery.”“I had a real shock as the digger bucket rolled over what I thought was a big stone to reveal a face,” Crawley said in the Burghley House statement.“I couldn’t believe it when they told me it was a Roman marble statue,” he added.The statue will now be displayed alongside other statues collected by the ninth earl at Burghley House."

        "category": "style",
        "text": "Tattoos are for life. Unless you buy a heavy duty concealer, as demonstrated by 25-year-old Paris Jackson on Sunday.The model and actor had all 80 of her tattoos expertly covered for the 66th annual Grammy awards, a process that only took her team of two makeup artists two hours in total. In a time lapse video posted to Instagram, Jackson’s skin is painted, brushed and sprayed a convincing ivory color. Out on the red carpet, her body — once a doodle-pad of colored ink and black lines — was a striking blank canvas, emphasized by a slinky, asymmetrical cut-out gown by Celine.While Jackson’s transformation was a savvy collaboration with makeup brand CoverFx, temporary tattoo camouflage has snowballed as an essential celebrity makeup technique.In South Korea, tattoos exist in a legal gray area — meaning K-Pop idols often avoid the social stigma by using bandages or makeup to hide any for broadcast performances. While shooting the Disney+ series “The Bear,” Jeremy Allen White required extensive tattoo coverage (and temporary tattoo re-application) that would withstand filming for hours in a hot kitchen. Similarly, for the 2022 film “My Policeman,” Harry Styles’ distinctive ink was airbrushed to oblivion — an undertaking that took two hours and required Styles to wear a gas mask in the makeup chair. “I’d look at myself with no tattoos and be like, ‘look at this boring *ss body,’” he told Teen Vogue.But the ability to opt out of permanent body art, even just for one night, seems to appeal to some in the limelight. In 2014, Amber Rose made headlines when she attended the Grammys in a decidedly stripped-back look. She wore a gold, art-deco sequinned Naeem Khan gown, her two tattoo sleeves completely erased — their blankness accentuated by a sprinkling of body glitter.On Saturday, Lana del Rey arrived at the pre-Grammy Gala with a couple of barely-there tatts seemingly peaking through a layer of makeup. Rey’s romantic black Vivienne Westwood dress perfectly framed her décolletage, as well as two faded collar bone script tattoos.Elsewhere on the red carpet, while Rey and Jackson were disguising their ink, Doja Cat (who scooped three awards this season) went face-first into the world of — albeit temporary — tattoos. Her sheer, flesh-toned, corset dress was paired with a gallery of removable tattoos, from an imposing chestpiece of a gothic cathedral to Romanesque gargoyles and statues. No one needed to ask who she was wearing, either. The designer of her outfit, Dilara Findikoglu, was emblazoned in Old English font across her forehead.Even the technology of impermanent tattoos has changed. No longer is a soaking wet towel and transfer paper your only option. Now, ink can be smart. Celebrity tattoo studio Bang Bang and research team Hyprskin have this year unveiled “Magic Ink,” a new light-sensitive ink formula that promises to be “rewritable, erasable and reprogrammable.” Using photochromic particles that react to UV light, the molecular structure — and therefore outward appearance — of Magic Ink can be altered by specific light wavelengths. In short, future tattoos may be as customizable and non-committal as a classroom whiteboard.One of the oldest forms of art, dating back at least as far back as 5000 BC, tattoos were once entirely defined by their permanence. Now, they’re almost as interchangeable as a piece of jewelry.Once a sign of commitment, sometimes even a badge of community, the meaning of a tattoo could be shifting. Whether it’s a temporary piece that washes away in a matter of weeks, or an inked image that can be brushed off to match an outfit, the culture of body art has widened out to include those who view their anatomy with the fixity of an etch-a-sketch."

        "title": "Dorothy’s ruby slippers from ‘The Wizard of Oz’ were stolen. Nineteen years later, they’re finally back home",
        "category": "style",
        "text": "A pair of ruby slippers, famously donned by Judy Garland (in character as Dorothy Gale) in “The Wizard of Oz,” has been returned to its owner years after the shoes were stolen from a museum dedicated to the actress.FBI agents on Monday reunited collector Michael Shaw with the shoes at the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. The agency said that Shaw “likened the experience to a heartfelt reunion with a long-lost friend.”The reunion is short-lived, though: The shoes will embark on a whirlwind journey around the world in the coming months, courtesy of Heritage Auctions, before they’ll be sold and sent to their final home — Kansas, perhaps?The Garland Museum, for its part, told CNN affiliate KARE that it’s working to buy the shoes for display in the museum, which is housed in Garland’s restored childhood home. Minnesota state legislators are also interested in keeping the shoes at the museum. A state senator this week introduced a bill that would allocate funds to the state’s historical society, so it can purchase the dazzling footwear and display it at Garland’s former home.The slippers were stolen from the museum in 2005, but were recovered in 2018 during a sting operation in Minneapolis, according to the US District Attorney’s Office of North Dakota. Terry Martin and Jerry Hal Saliterman, both in their 70s, were separately charged with the theft. Martin pleaded guilty last year, while Saliterman, who was charged just this week, maintains that he’s innocent. Before Saliterman was identified, Martin’s lawyer said Martin’s associate in the crime allegedly believed the slippers to have been made with actual rubies. (The shoes are merely painted red and covered in sequins, according to the Smithsonian.)Though the slippers, which Garland’s Dorothy famously clicked together three times to send herself — and “her little dog too,” of course — back home from Oz, aren’t encrusted in gems, they’re extremely valuable: The US District Attorney’s Office of North Dakota estimated the shoes are currently worth around $3.5 million.“The Wizard of Oz,” frequently cited as one of the greatest films of all time, ushered in a grand new era of studio filmmaking when it premiered in 1939 — and Dorothy’s ruby slippers, brought to life in glorious Technicolor onscreen, are among its enduring and most-beloved artifacts.Only four pairs of the slippers used in the film are still known to exist, per the North Dakota attorney’s office. One pair is housed at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, though they were initially mismatched: Garland’s name was written on the inside of both shoes, but with different numbers, indicating that each shoe belonged to a different pair used throughout filming. (And though both shoes were covered in felt on the bottom to quiet the sound of Garland’s footsteps as she danced on set, one slipper also showed significantly more wear than the other.)It wasn’t until Smithsonian experts were tasked by the FBI with confirming the authenticity of the stolen pair, after their recovery in 2018, that the museum’s slippers found their long-lost matches: The stolen shoes were respectively marked with “#1-” and “#6 Judy Garland,” just like the pair displayed at the Smithsonian. The two pairs remain mismatched, though, Smithsonian entertainment curator Ryan Lintelman told CNN.Several of the known pairs have made the journey from Garland’s feet to fan collections: An MGM costumer discovered a few pairs of ruby slippers on the studio lot in 1970 — one pair was auctioned that year, and eventually donated to the Smithsonian — and he kept at least two pairs for himself, though Shaw later bought one of them. Another of the original pairs is on display at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ museum, donated by a group of benefactors including Leonardo DiCaprio. And in 1939, a lucky Tennessee teenager won slippers worn on-screen in a contest, which she kept until the late 1980s, when she sold them to a fellow movie fan.Actor Debbie Reynolds, matriarch of another Hollywood dynasty, also bought a rare pair from the lucky MGM costumer — prototype slippers with curly toes that were never used in the film."

She also announced that she was parting ways with her talent agency, writing: “I am truly sorry for causing a lot of trouble for many people and betraying those who have supported me.”Organizers of the event meanwhile released a statement saying that Shiino had “requested to withdraw from the contest due to personal reasons.” Kaoru Wada, chair of the Miss Nippon Association, added that the 2024 title will remain “vacant.”Despite being a naturalized citizen who speaks fluent Japanese and has lived in the country since she was 5 years old, Shiino’s pageant victory proved controversial, with some critics questioning whether someone without Japanese ethnicity could encapsulate the country’s beauty ideals.“I wanted to be recognized as a Japanese person,” Shiino told CNN in Tokyo following her win last month. “I kept being told that I’m not Japanese, but I am absolutely Japanese, so I entered Miss Japan genuinely believing in myself. I was really happy to be recognized like this.”The decision to pick a winner with European heritage prompted debate on social media, raising questions about what it means to be Japanese and the impact of Western beauty ideals in Asia.“If the Miss Nippon contest is based on the concept of beauty, I personally wish that it would be based on standards of Japanese beauty,” historian Hiroe Yamashita wrote on X following Shiino’s victory. “But With Karolina Shiino’s appearance, an (ethnically) Japanese girl has no chance of winning under the modern values of beauty.”Recounting to CNN the difficulties she faced growing up in Japan — an ethnically homogeneous country with comparatively low levels of immigration — Shiino called for a broader definition of who should be considered Japanese. “After all, we live in an era of diversity — where diversity is needed,” she said at the time."

        "text": "More than 4,000 culturally significant items, including textiles, ceramics, and clothing, have been repatriated to Peru, their country of origin, the Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.The 4,600 cultural assets were returned to the South American country from the United States and countries across Europe including Germany, Italy, and Switzerland, the foreign ministry said Wednesday.According to the statement, Peru’s Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Foreign Affairs worked alongside local authorities, consulates and embassies in the countries where the objects were located to bring them back to Peru.Of the items returned, 4,556 came from a collection of archaeological material belonging to the late American archaeologist and anthropologist John Rowe, the statement said. Another 33 were returned from Italy – 21 of which were previously seized by Italian authorities from an art gallery, the statement continued. Among these items were clothing and ceramics from the Nazca, Wari, Inca, Paracas and Chimú cultures, it said.A silver incense burner from the 18th or 19th century was returned from Portugal, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, and other archaeological items were voluntarily returned from Germany and the Netherlands. Swiss authorities also seized and repatriated four pieces of pre-Hispanic ceramics, the statement continued.“Since 2019, Peru has managed to recover more than 7,000 pieces of its cultural heritage, establishing itself as an international benchmark in the fight against illicit trafficking of cultural property,” Peru’s foreign minister, Javier González-Olaechea, said at a ceremony marking the return of the objects.“We will continue on this upward path in strengthening sovereignty over our precious heritage, because the cultural legacy of Peru is a fundamental pillar for the formation of our identity as Peruvians,” Leslie Urteaga, the country’s culture minister, said, according to a post on the Ministry of Culture’s X account."

        "text": "Diamonds are forever – especially for Emily Ratajkowski, who has chosen to turn her engagement ring into something entirely new following her split from her film producer husband, Sebastian Bear-McClard.With the help of Alison Chemla, creative director of jewelry brand Alison Lou, Ratajkowski worked to remake her old engagement ring, which featured a pear-shaped and a princess-cut diamond, into two separate rings.“The rings represent my own personal evolution,” the model told Vogue. “I don’t think a woman should be stripped of her diamonds just because she’s losing a man.”Now, the pear-shaped diamond sits on Ratajkowski’s pinkie finger, while the princess cut has been flanked by more trapezoid stones and turned into a new sparkler.Ratajkowski went on to explain that she got the idea after reading Stephanie Danler’s story “The Unravelers” in The Paris Review.“(It) includes the story of her grandmother’s snake ring—a ring that is made up of the different stones from her various marriages,” said Ratajkowski, who was catapulted to fame after she appeared in the music video for Robin Thicke’s 2013 track “Blurred Lines.”“I loved the idea of a ring unabashedly representing the many lives a woman has lived.”The model, who shares a son with Bear-McClard, added that creating the rings was a “fun project” to work on “amidst a hugely transitional period in my life.”“The ring became symbolic to me—some kind of token or evidence of my life becoming my own again,” she said.“Somehow, these rings feel like a reminder that I can make myself happy in ways I never imagined,” she added."

While the cost of living is spiraling and hitting groceries and other everyday costs hard, the price of plane tickets is at a 15-year low – in the United States, at least. Travel expert Katy Nastro tells CNN Business that average airfare is nearly a quarter less than it was prepandemic, and in fact, “hasn’t been this cheap since 2009.”This is the first full “normal” year of travel since Covid rocked our world, and while Nastro doesn’t expect prices to skyrocket anytime soon, she does sound one note of warning.“The single biggest factor for why we see cheap flights is competition,” says Nastro. “We want (budget) carriers in the mix because it actually places downward pressure on the legacy carriers” and keeps prices down. Airline mergers could affect that, meaning less competition and, potentially, higher fares. But this week, a federal judge blocked a merger of JetBlue and Spirit Airlines.If you’re tempted by new visa programs and tax incentives to encourage digital nomads, investors and families to begin fresh lives abroad, then our guide to the best countries for expats will help get you started.Portugal’s Golden Visa program has been a hot favorite for years, and the cost of living is generally more affordable than elsewhere in Europe.

        "title": "Why this is Las Vegas’ hottest neighborhood",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Visitors love Las Vegas for the glitz, glam and garishness of the resorts that line the 4.2-mile Las Vegas Strip, but the most exciting neighborhood in the city right now is all about art.This area, fittingly called the Arts District, has become a haven for local creatives.It’s a hotbed of culinary excellence, visual spectacle, digital design and immersive theater. It’s home to one of the city’s most popular restaurants, several cult-favorite bars and breweries, one-of-a-kind shopping and a boutique hotel. It’s even got the city’s only indoor half-pipe.In a town synonymous with flashing neon, blaring slots and other electronic marvels, the Arts District continues to captivate with seemingly boundless achievements of the human mind.It also happens to be largely a mystery to those from out of town.There’s no formal data on how many of the 40.8 million visitors to Las Vegas in 2023 made it to the Arts District. Whatever the number, it’s a fraction of the visitors who arrive in town, check in at a hotel on the Strip and never venture more than a short walk or rideshare away.The Arts District was officially created in the late 1990s. Back then, it received the nickname 18b, owing to an 18-block area bounded by Hoover Avenue, Colorado Avenue, Las Vegas Boulevard, Commerce Street and 4th Street. Over time, the neighborhood has grown beyond these boundaries.Today it loosely encompasses about 25 to 30 blocks (depending on whom you ask) south and west of Downtown.In the beginning, the neighborhood revolved around a destination called The Arts Factory, a circa-1920s building that was repurposed to hold studios for more than 30 artists.First Friday, a street fair and gallery crawl on the first Friday of every month, started in 2002 and was designed to get people into the area.Gradually, in the 2010s, the Arts District started growing.The first inflection point came in 2013 when sisters Christina and Pamela Dylag opened the Velveteen Rabbit, a laid-back cocktail bar on Main Street. Another came in 2016, when Derek Stonebarger opened ReBAR, a dive bar inside an antique store practically across the street.The modern era began in 2018, when chef and Las Vegas native James Trees opened an Italian restaurant named after his great aunt: Esther’s Kitchen.With its handmade pastas and obsessive selection of amari behind the bar, Esther’s became a sensation practically overnight. In 2020, Trees was named a finalist for the James Beard Award: Best Chef Southwest.During the Covid-19 pandemic, he became beloved among locals for take-home pasta kits and a village of converted greenhouses for al fresco, socially distanced dining out back. By early 2023, it was harder to get a reservation at Esther’s than it was to get one at many high-end restaurants on the Strip.That’s when Trees decided to expand.Instead of adding to the original location’s 58-seat dining room, he bought the circa-1943 Retro Vegas building on the corner of Main Street and California Avenue. The new $6 million digs, which opened March 8, seat 160 in the dining room and 27 at a standalone bar. The new kitchen is twice the size of the original restaurant.Perhaps most importantly, Trees said that when dinner service ends around 11 p.m. every night, the new location will stay open with a limited menu until 2 a.m., a first for a restaurant in this part of the city.“The new number of tables and [the new extended] hours aren’t to add more covers, we just want to allow people to actually be able to get a reservation, then come and spend more time and enjoy themselves,” he said.Esther’s Kitchen isn’t the only passion project in the Arts District; over the last few years, dozens of shops and other destinations have put down roots in the neighborhood, too.Take Fresa’s Skate Shop, home to the only indoor half-pipe in Las Vegas. Owner Amanda Quintanilla, who is from El Salvador, started the Main Street shop in 2022 as a place to support the local roller-skating and rollerblading communities. Today, the store sells dozens of different skates and blades and welcomes skaters to come and use the ramp for $15 per person per hour. Fresa’s rents skates and blades, too.“When I started skating [during the pandemic], the Arts District was the place to come and skate and hang out with other people who were into the scene,” she said. “It’s still the place to come and skate and connect with other people in the community, and now we are a huge part of that.”At Spilled Milk, a home store on Commerce Street, guests can purchase funky glassware, colorful candleholders, pots in the shape of animal heads and exclusive items from local ceramicists.Owner Kori Cortez opened the store in February after years of pop-ups at which she sold her own macrame rainbows and other original wall-hangings.“I developed a love [for] and connection to the Arts District,” said Cortez, who previously played bass in an electronic rock band. “The murals, the coffee shops and the artsy people — I didn’t want to be anywhere else.”Even veteran hospitality personalities are getting in on Arts District action.Chef Wolfgang Puck is a co-owner of 1228 Main, a bistro that opened in July, and locals line up on weekends for pastries and loaves of freshly baked bread. The English Hotel, which opened in 2022, bears the name of celebrity chef Todd English.Of course, art is still the main driving force behind everything in the neighborhood.The Arts Factory remains the geographic and creative center, with artisans ranging from painters to jewelers keeping studios inside. Nearby, the “Greetings from Las Vegas” mural was painted in 2020, and it is now one of the most photographed destinations in the entire city.Galleries span the gamut from cutting edge NFTs (the JRNY Gallery) to more conventional contemporary art (the Priscilla Fowler Fine Art Gallery). Geller Gallery, set to open on Commerce Street in March, specializes exclusively in imported art.There’s also a shop where fans can purchase original work, prints and merchandise from Adam Rellah, the man behind the modern art brand Pretty Done. Rellah opened the storefront in August after painting murals all over the city. He said he didn’t even think about opening anywhere else.“Main Street is the new Downtown,” he said. “Las Vegas is small, so there aren’t other places that embrace weird art, creativity, uniqueness and individuality. It’s like we set ourselves up for this [Arts District] revival. I’m glad it’s becoming what it is now.”Theater is alive and well in the Arts District, too.The LaMarre Theater is the only free-standing theater in Las Vegas with Black owners and operators, and the Majestic Repertory Theatre continues to generate buzz for immersive performances that make the audience part of the show. The Cockroach Theater (yes, that’s really its name) is the second stage of the Vegas Theatre Company and spotlights emerging thespians.The Arts District also has built a reputation for its eclectic nightlife—a scene that is more loungey, vibey and down-to-earth than the thumping and spendy nightclubs on the Strip.Velveteen Rabbit and ReBAR were pioneers in this space, and subsequent additions such as Jammyland (with a Jamaican motif), Silver Stamp (with a robust beer menu), and Nightmare Café (a horror-themed cross-between TGI Fridays and Spirit Halloween) laid the groundwork for further innovation.18bin, a newish outdoor bar just east of the Arts Factory building, is always hopping, even at noon on a Friday.The past six months have seen other noteworthy newcomers to Arts District nightlife.Most recently, the vintage store Vintage Vegas opened a 1980s-themed cocktail lounge on March 1 stocked with barware and other period pieces guests can buy.At Liquid Diet, accessible through an alley or unmarked door off Commerce Street (look for the mural of a bloody hand), co-owners Brett Pfister and Patrick Mannion list the nightly menu on handwritten pieces of brown butcher paper hanging from the bar, and they serve cocktails in mismatched ceramics and glassware curated from local antique stores.At Stray Pirate, a pirate-themed bar, portraits on the walls depict dogs dressed as scallywags (see what they did there?), and booze-heavy drinks will have you wondering whether the digital images of whales and sharks you can see through “windows” behind the bar are real.Chris Gutierrez, general manager and partner, said the bar is the perfect representation of what the Arts District is all about.“When we were contemplating where to build Stray Pirate, the Arts District was the perfect location for our concept: A walkable community full of other food and beverage experiences that push each other to build on creativity,” said Gutierrez, who is famous around Las Vegas for the cocktail programs he created at bars such as Corduroy, Oak & Ivy and Atomic Liquors.“Our concept really focuses on not only craft cocktails, but is an immersive, fun, tropical cocktail bar. Ultimately, the Arts District’s ethos and Stray Pirate are aligned in providing creative cocktails, service and experience for our guests.”The Arts District also has birthed its share of craft breweries and wine bars in the past few years.On the brewery front, locals love Nevada Brew Works (and the adjacent Soul Belly BBQ), and the slightly more hipster Able Baker Brewing, which also serves food. For oenophiles, The Wine Garden offers monthly classes where guests can sip wine and create flower crowns, while Garagiste offers tastings and light snacks in a modern space.Evolution of the Arts District will continue into the second half of 2024 and beyond.Toward the southern end of the neighborhood (or just beyond it; again, depending on whom you ask), the Atomic Golf driving range is slated to open in March.Later this spring, Trees is planning to launch two additional experiences at the new Esther’s: a second story as-yet-unnamed cocktail lounge that overlooks the main dining room, and an enclosed courtyard that would host farmers’ markets on Sundays. In the fall, he is planning to open a French bistro and bar in an old service station several blocks south, and a prix fixe, fine-dining restaurant in the location of the old Esther’s.Also this summer, Nevada H&C Distilling, renowned for its Smoke Wagon Bourbon, was expected to open a new facility on the corner of Wyoming Avenue and Industrial Road. The new digs were expected to comprise an expansive production area, as well as a gift shop where visitors can purchase products and check in for tours.On a longer timeline, the city has green-lighted the construction of more than 3,000 new living units in and around the Arts District — developments that most certainly will change the complexion of the neighborhood once again.In a city that reinvents itself constantly, it’s good to know the next evolution will be inspired by art.Matt Villano, a writer and editor in Northern California, has covered Las Vegas for 20 years."

        "title": "The remote destination serving some of Turkey’s most exciting food",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Just off the D515 state highway to Kuşadası, a meandering asphalted road cuts through the pine trees and undulating olive groves of the Mediterranean landscape to reach the village of Caferli.Few people would think to come this way, but it’s exactly here that you’ll find one of Turkey’s most groundbreaking destination restaurants, where the menu - connected to the natural environment - is unlike any typically found in a country known for its delicious food.Çiy restaurant created by chef Damla Uğurtaş, overlooks an evergreen valley and Aegean Sea from its outdoor terrace, where tables rest in the shade of a large olive tree.For Uğurtaş, who comes from the Turkish west coast city of Izmir, about 60 miles (100 kilometers north of the restaurant), the remote location is the result of her own meandering journey, one which saw her veer from a degree in English literature to enter the world of fine dining.“Since the inception of Çiy, I dreamt that it would be located in a village, which reflected the character of the Aegean, in a place where we could feel the spirit of the trees and even the sea,” she tells CNN.After graduating from MSA, a highly regarded culinary arts academy in Istanbul, Uğurtaş climbed the restaurant career ladder, becoming kitchen chef at 7Bilgeler, a renowned vineyard in the nearby village of Gökçealan.But, determined to open her own restaurant, she undertook an arduous renovation and building project to transform and expand a collection of traditional buildings in the obscure village of Caferli into her innovative dining establishment.From the main gate, the restaurant and an attached guest house appear like a village-within-a-village. Its natural stone structures and descending pathways stand among herb gardens and terraces overlooking the expansive valley.The main building – which includes the restaurant on the ground floor and three rooms upstairs – is newly built, while three guesthouses on the property are renovated village houses.All the interior design has been specially chosen down to the smallest details, from vintage furnishings and traditional carpets in every room to the small lace doilies that rest on the water glasses.The restaurant itself is an anomaly for this unknown village. It’s a fine-dining endeavor with a tasting menu that is both shaped by the imagination of its chef as well as the ingredients of the region.“Çiy is a reflection of my love for nature,” says Uğurtaş. “I prefer a cauliflower that happily resisted the cold in winter over a bland pepper that is harvested by forcing the soil. I tell the producers I work with, ‘I will only buy what grows beautifully, non-toxically and with a high yield in your soil.’“Instead of expecting my farmers to produce ingredients they’re unfamiliar with, I ask for the best and most low-intervention product that they know and already produce. As such, I believe I leave room for them to do their job, while I do mine. The region is already multi-layered and fertile. Playing with existing products makes me happy.”Translated to the plate, the chef’s dishes embrace simplicity, allowing nature’s flavors to present themselves fully, but are also enhanced through technique and experimentation, which lift them from flavorfully satiating to very memorable.“I never imagined Çiy as a restaurant in a city, that’s why I always feel that we’re exactly in the right place,” she says. “Ease of access to our ingredients and producers is our biggest advantage, and since our priority is taste, this is the restaurant’s most defining feature.”Uğurtaş’s savory éclair has powdered shrimp shell within the pastry, is filled with a shrimp cream and accompanied by a cup of peach kombucha. Her homemade pastas, which she learned to make while training alongside a renowned Italian chef in Istanbul, are topped with veal ragout, or composed of ancient grains such as Kızılca wheat and served with thinly sliced calamari in a sauce of egg yolk, Bergama Tulum cheese, olive oil and fermented mussel juice.Plates are paired with wines from a list that focuses more on Turkey’s boutique vineyards.The more casual lunch service at Çiy differs according to the day. On Sundays, there are brunches with croquembouche towers of puff pastries filled with cream and gilded with caramel threads. On Saturdays, the Çiy burger takes center stage with its homemade pickles, ketchup, peach mustard, and buttery bun. And on Wednesdays, Uğurtaş and her team, who already love to make their own sourdough bread, make a signature sourdough pizza.Preferring to define her food as “healing Mediterranean cuisine,” Uğurtaş is part of a newly burgeoning gastronomical movement in Turkey, which focuses on not only satiating the palate, but also the soul.Chefs are leaving the cities to open restaurants in remote locations, closer to nature and to the rich culture and ingredients of the country’s different regions. Among them, Osman Sezener and his restaurant Od Urla, Ozan Kumbasar’s Vino Locale in Urla, Tuncay Gülcü’s Chayote and Serra Beklen’s Capra Çukurbağ in Kaş.“Damla Uğurtaş is breaking new ground with her fusion cuisine in a very unknown location,” says Adnan Kaya, a columnist for Hürriyet newspaper focusing on Aegean culture. “This trend seems to be the new philosophy in Turkish gastronomy and Çiy will be among the pioneers.”“We are aware as humans that the planet can no longer meet our demands and this is where chef Uğurtaş arrives with her healing cuisine,” adds Kaya. “She creates her own dishes without rushing, with true ingredients from the region, with respect to the seasons, and every member in her staff is integral to this, they all present their unique contribution.“They all grow and learn together, becoming more beautiful with each day as they complete each other, produce together, cook and laugh. And this is reflected in the flavors. Let’s hope all restaurants can be like this.”Guests visiting Çiy bask in its serenity, a far cry from the hustle and chaos of Turkish mega city Istanbul, which has until now been the driving culinary force in Turkey.The restaurant sits quietly in its village, the soft hum of conversation on the terrace, the surrounding valley vast but silent. A cold signature cocktail rests on the bar, sipped by guests wearing the restaurant’s own fragrant mosquito repellent made from local herbs.It’s a striking scene that makes it easy to believe that a small but significant revolution is taking place in Turkey’s food scene. One that’s closer to, and in harmony with, nature.Uğurtaş says that customers who make the journey will be rewarded for their efforts.“Hosting guests requires a detailed execution from top to bottom and in a remote village you can’t achieve this with food alone,” says Uğurtaş.“That’s why a holistic way of living prevails at Çiy. We welcome our guests with a philosophy formed by the contribution of the village, the region, the people we work with and our own personal values.“Every detail exudes this philosophy, from the fabric to the colors, the plates to the food, the staff to the music played, the glasses to the wine list. This is what I love most about my own restaurant.”Feride Yalav-Heckeroth is a freelance writer based between Istanbul and Lake Constance and the author of her own guidebook, The 500 Hidden Secrets of Istanbul. Her writing has been published in Kinfolk, Brownbook, The Travel Almanac, Wallpaper*, Travel + Leisure and Conde Nast Traveler."

        "title": "Inside Tokyo’s oldest onigiri restaurant",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "A short walk from Sensoji, the oldest temple in Tokyo, sits another aging classic – Onigiri Asakusa Yadoroku.Founded in 1954, it’s believed to be the city’s oldest onigiri (Japanese rice ball) restaurant.“The reason why my family started this business is simple,” says Yosuke Miura, third-generation owner of the rice ball diner.“My grandfather didn’t work and my grandmother had trouble living a financially stable life.”Needing to support her unemployed husband and family, Miura’s grandmother founded the rice ball eatery – an origin story that’s reflected in the restaurant’s moniker.Asakusa is the name of the district where the shop is located, but Yadoroku – which translates literally as “House Six” – has another, less flattering, definition.“Roku means ‘rokudenashi,’ which means ‘useless person,’” he tells CNN. “So directly translated, the restaurant’s name means ‘a useless person’s house.’”Long a popular snack choice for travelers, onigiri – also known as omusubi – can be found in convenience stores around Japan. Usually triangular or oval, they come stuffed with anything from spicy cod roe and pickled greens to grilled slices of beef with mayonnaise.“I think that rice balls are the most typical food that everyone eats, from children to the elderly in Japan,” says Miura. “There is probably no one in Japan who hasn’t eaten one.”Several decades ago, archaeologists claimed to have found a fossilized clump of rice from Japan’s Yayoi period (300 BCE to 250 ACE) that appeared similar to the onigiri that’s eaten today. Meanwhile, old paintings and records suggest that these handy meals have been enjoyed by hungry travelers and workers for centuries. The treats were even included in the very first bento boxes introduced on Japanese trains in 1885.Fast forward to today and Onigiri Asakusa Yadoroku is an international attraction, luring visitors from around Japan and overseas. The 16-seater eatery has been included in the Michelin Guide as a Bib Gourmand Restaurant (meaning it offers high quality and good value) since 2019.“There are three elements to a delicious rice ball – a good balance of seaweed, rice and ingredients,” says Miura.While the shop uses rice and fillings from around Japan – such as shrimp in soy sauce, pickled plums, salmon and fish roe, it only uses nori (seaweed) from Tokyo.Of all the ingredients, rice has the least flavor – nevertheless, is a crucial element in the chef’s mind.Every September and October after the annual rice harvesting season, Miura gathers grains from around the country to sample. Then, he decides which variety they will use in the restaurant for the rest of the year.For instance, Miura says he sampled more than 30 different types of grains before deciding to go with Koshihikari rice from Niigata prefecture in 2023.To make the actual ball, he first puts the rice into a triangular mold, then picks the chosen fillings from the dozens of buckets that line the chef’s counter. He slaps the fillings into the rice before gently wrapping the entire package in a crisp sheet of nori.It’s then handed to the customers in a bamboo basket. (Diners are advised to eat it swiftly before the warmth of the rice softens the nori.)The popularity of these versatile snacks has risen globally in recent years, with onigiri now found around the world.“Nowadays everyone understands the word ‘onigiri,’ so in that sense I’m glad that we are getting some recognition,” says Miura.In addition to being easy to carry, these savory nori-wrapped rice balls are also loved for their adaptability.Miura says he often experiments with different flavors from different cultures when he travels, noting that he added cheese, tomato and Italian olive oil to an onigiri while representing his country inside the Japan Pavilion at Expo Milano in 2015.“It’s not that onigiri has to be traditional, it’s about whether you can put your favorite ingredients in it and eat it deliciously,” he says.“I think it’s probably good to add ingredients that match the culture of the people in the area … I don’t think that the rice balls have to be salmon or tuna with mayonnaise.”As the third-generation owner of the decades-old shop, Miura says he didn’t take the helm of Yadoroku out of obligation to his family – he’s been genuinely passionate about onigiri since childhood.“Every day when I came home from kindergarten and elementary school, I ate rice balls that my grandmother made for me,” he says. “It was a great snack. When I came home and felt a bit hungry, I didn’t eat cookies and cakes at all.“I do it because I like it. I have absolutely no intention of continuing to preserve tradition. If I didn’t like onigiri in the first place, I’d probably quit the shop right away.”Onigiri Asakusa Yadoroku; 3-9-10 Asakusa, Taito-ku, Tokyo, 111-0032, Japan"

        "title": "French appetite for frogs’ legs threatens frog species, experts warn Macron",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "The popularity of the famous French delicacy of cuisses de grenouille, or frogs’ legs, is threatening the existence of certain frog species, a group of more than 500 environmental campaigners has warned French President Emmanuel Macron.In an open letter written to Macron earlier this month, organized by French nonprofits Robin des Bois and Vétérinaires pour la Biodiversité (Veterinarians for Biodiversity), and German charity Pro Wildlife, the 557 signatories said 4,070 tons of frozen frogs’ legs are imported into the European Union every year - equivalent to 80 million-200 million frogs, depending on the size of the species.A joint study by Robin des Bois and Pro Wildlife found that France alone consumes more than 3,000 tons of frozen frogs’ legs a year.The vast majority of these frogs come from wild populations in Indonesia, Turkey and Albania, the letter said, where some frog species are in significant decline. Vietnam is also a large exporter of frogs’ legs, but these frogs are typically farmed rather than wild, according to a media statement accompanying the letter.The 557 signatories to the letter, who work in the fields of research, nature conservation and veterinary medicine, suggested France should shoulder the responsibility of protecting frog species, given that it is the country that consumes the most frogs’ legs in the EU.According to the letter, recent studies have found that common species such as the crab-eating frog and the rice-field frog are in decline due to “intense commercial harvests and exports for many years.”Though frog populations native to the EU are protected against “commercial exploitation” under the Habitats Directive, the letter says, this protection does not extend to species imported into the region.“It’s absurd: the natural frog populations here in Europe are protected under EU law,” Sandra Altherr, head of science at Pro Wildlife, said in the media statement. “But the EU still tolerates the collection of millions of animals in other countries – even if this threatens the frog populations there. This is not at all in line with the EU’s recent biodiversity strategy.”Alain Moussu, president of Veterinarians for Biodiversity, said vets joined this initiative because “they are both sensitive to the cruelty that prevails in this market and concerned about the ecological imbalances caused by the collapse of amphibian populations.” One of these imbalances, Moussu suggested, is an increase in mosquito populations, which could have a knock-on effect on human health.The signatories called on France to develop proposals to protect declining frog species, and to ensure that the monitoring, regulation and sustainability of the trade in frogs’ legs is governed by international trade rules.CNN has reached out to the Élysée Palace for comment."

        "text": "Warm thoughts of young romance – not the cold, harsh possibilities of a Midwestern road trip in winter – were on Dawn O’Hair’s mind as she left Chicago for Indianapolis to see her boyfriend.Her weekend visit, back in the winter of 1997-98, did not go well. After a spat with her beau, O’Hair got back into her car very early on a Monday morning to return to Chicago and her job.She should have stayed put. The 23-year-old was driving up Interstate 65 straight into a blizzard.“I ended up in whiteout conditions. I had trouble maintaining control in my 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier,” she said. “The wind was crazy. The snow was blowing sideways. It was super hard to see. It was horrible.”“I got nervous and decided to pull over [but] my car got stuck,” she said. “I didn’t know what to do. I got out and tried to figure out a way to get traction, but without luck.”And there she was – in a real mess. She hadn’t checked the forecasts. She had nothing particularly warm to wear. No blankets. No winter kit. Just her Chevy and time to ponder how things went so wrong so fast.O’Hair’s story is a far too common one of people caught off guard by a blizzard or some other onslaught of wintry weather.Blizzards can happen over a surprisingly wide range of the calendar – just ask these runners caught in a blizzard in October in Utah in 2021.Of course, we expect rough winter weather in January. And on the first days of January 2024, a second monster winter storm with possibly dangerous blizzards in portions of it threatened much of the central and eastern United States.Unless you live in a year-round warm climate and plan to stay there, it’s important to know how winter storms behave, how to avoid and prepare for them, and heaven forbid, what to do in the worst-case scenario.First, not every ol’ winter storm is technically a blizzard.The National Weather Service says a blizzard must have large amounts of falling snow or blowing snow, winds greater than 35 mph (56 kph) and visibility of less than a quarter mile (0.4 km) for at least three hours. A ground blizzard has no falling snow; instead, it blows around snow that had fallen before the blizzard kicked up.Any weather system with below freezing temperatures along with snow and ice can be a safety hazard. Blizzards, however, are one of the most dangerous types of winter storms.They can lead not only “to perilous driving conditions under low visibility and snow-covered roads, but can also lead to disorientation for anyone walking or driving, resulting in the person not knowing where they are or where they are going,” said Michael Muccilli, meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s NWS, in an email interview with CNN Travel.“Oftentimes the strong winds and cold temperatures associated with blizzards can produce dangerous wind chills, which can lead to hypothermia and frostbite, especially if stuck outside for extended periods,” he said.Awareness and avoidance are your best weapons against blizzards and other bad winter weather.If you’re taking a road trip, “begin checking weather conditions about a week in advance of your trip and make sure to check again each day as the weather forecasts become more fine-tuned,” Muccilli said.“Have alternate plans for your travel, and if weather conditions are looking increasingly unfavorable, use those alternate plans or delay travel.”Muccilli said you should check conditions along your entire route, not just the starting and ending points, especially if you’re crossing through high mountain passes.If you’re going hiking or camping, checking forecasts is a must, said Beth Pratt, the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation.Don’t skip a forecast check just because it’s fall, spring or even summer in some locations. They can lull you into a false sense of security because your guard might not be up as much as the dead of winter, Pratt said.She resides on the border of Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevadas, where you might start out on a hike on a late fall day while it’s still warm but suddenly encounter a dangerous wintry blast.NOAA has nine winter forecast tools you can check online to see what might be ahead.A little geographical and climate knowledge helps, too.“Blizzards are most common in the upper Midwest and Great Plains in the United States, but can occur in most areas of the country except the Gulf Coast and coastal California,” Muccilli said. Elsewhere in the world, you’ll encounter them most often in Russia, central and northeastern Asia (including China), northern Europe, Canada and Antarctica.Just as it’s important to know blizzards aren’t a winter-only event, you must also realize they might happen in places you usually associate with hot weather.Iran was struck by a 1972 blizzard that killed thousands. At least four people died in Spain early in 2021 in a rare blizzard. And parts of inland Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas were slammed by blizzard conditions in the 1993 storm of the century.Having the right clothing is crucial if you’re going to a place where blizzards and other cold-weather storms might happen.The American Red Cross says to “wear layered clothing, mittens or gloves, and a hat. Outer garments should be tightly woven and water repellent. Mittens or gloves and a hat will prevent the loss of body heat.”Remember O’Hair’s predicament. It’s important to bring along winter clothing even if it’s not that cold or threatening as you depart or you just plan on staying in your car.Layering is important, says the Massachusetts government website: “Dress in several layers of loose-fitting, lightweight clothing instead of a single heavy layer.”Minnesota’s state government points out another reason to layer: You might need to take a layer or two off to avoid overheating, perspiring too much and then subsequently getting chilled. The website advises mittens over gloves.If you’re outside, the Red Cross also says to cover your mouth to protect your lungs from severely cold air. Don’t gulp in deep breaths of frigid air and talk as little as possible.Make sure you have fully stocked safety kit before you head out. Muccilli said the kit should include:– A survival blanket– Road salt and a shovel– A scraper– Jumper cables– Drinking water– A repair kit– A flashlight and road flares– A cell phone chargerYou should also fill your wiper fluid and check your tire pressure, tire tread and oil before leaving. Make sure your phone is fully charged.What if you run into bad winter weather?“If the weather becomes too severe to continue driving, pull over, and if possible move your car to the closest gas station or hotel and ride out the storm,” Muccilli said. Don’t drive around barriers onto closed-off roads.What if your car is stuck in the snow?If conditions are safe enough, you can “attempt to shovel out your tires and throw down sand, rock salt, dirt, cardboard or kitty litter to give your vehicle more traction. If this does not work, call for roadside assistance or emergency services.”Otherwise, Muccilli said stay inside your vehicle except long enough to set road flares or put out a colorful cloth to make yourself visible. Contact emergency services with as much information about your situation as you can.The NWS advises not to leave your vehicle to walk for help during a blizzard. You could get disoriented. You should run the motor about 10 minutes each hour for heat, it says, but open the window a crack for fresh air. Clear snow away from the exhaust pipe if possible.Whether you are camping, hiking, backcountry skiing or doing other similar types of outside activities, carry the correct safety gear. Muccilli said this might include but is not limited to:– Proper footwear – Enough water and food– A headlamp and a lighter– A whistle– A first aid kit– A map or other navigation tools– A transceiver to transmit your location in case you are trapped in an avalanche– A probe to pinpoint your exact location– A shovel to dig out– An airbag pack to increase your chances of staying near the surface of an avalanche.“Never hike or ski alone and make sure someone knows where you are going,” he said.People enjoying a day (or night) at a ski resort should check the local weather forecast just before heading out to the slopes, said Rick Shandler, national program director of the Safety Team at National Ski Patrol.He cautions skiers to not let their investment in a pricey lift ticket cloud their judgment.“People want to get the most value out of their lift tickets and may stay out past what common sense dictates” when blizzards, dense fog or other bad weather is approaching, he said.He suggested taking the following with you on the slopes:– A fully charged cell phone in an inner pocket. The cold can quickly sap your battery if it’s in an outer pocket. Get the number of the ski patrol at the resort before you head out and add it to your phone.– A whistle. The sound carries farther than yelling if you’re down and a ski patrol needs to find you.– A space blanket. Made of Mylar, they are inexpensive, easy to tote and can keep you warmer and easier to spot if you become stranded.Pratt said the closest she ever came to dying in a blizzard was in her college years back in 1990. It was in June of all months, while she was hiking with two friends on Mount Washington in New Hampshire.The mountain is notorious for its dangerous, fickle weather, even in summer.“The storm came up very fast. We were in college, and young and broke and didn’t have great gear either.”With the wind whipping and whiteout conditions of a blizzard, “the only thing that saved us is we found the tracks to the Mount Washington Cog Railway. So we had breadcrumbs to follow. If we had not been near those train tracks, we would have had to hunker down. The wind was so fierce it had shredded our rain gear.”What if you end up in a worst-case scenario like Pratt? She said there are “two things to focus on: Stay warm and stay still.”“It’s ill-advised to walk yourself out of a blizzard. Navigation is tough, and you burn more energy when you are cold, so conserve it. Find shelter. If there is none to find, build a snow cave if there’s enough snow. Wait it out.”The NWS has some additional advice for dire situations when it’s just you vs. the raw elements:– Try to find shelter: Also, attempt to stay dry and cover all of your body.– Can’t find shelter? See if you can make a lean-to, windbreak or snow cave for protection from the wind. Try to set a fire. If there are rocks nearby, put those around the fire to retain heat. Global Rescue says even low-hanging tree branches could provide some protection.– Out of water? You should melt snow for drinking water. The NWS and Global Rescue warn that eating unmelted snow will lower your body temperature.– Strategic exercise: From time to time, move your arms, legs, fingers and toes to keep your blood pumping and stay warm. But don’t overdo it. “The strain from the cold and the hard labor may cause a heart attack. Sweating could lead to a chill and hypothermia,” the NWS website says.Fortunately for Dawn O’Hair, what she lacked in winter preparation she made up for in a good decision, good luck and good connections with people in northern Indiana.She wisely stayed with her car instead of walking off into the blizzard for help.Less than an hour later, a young woman pulled up and offered her a ride to a gas station. That woman had a boyfriend who was a police officer, and he took her to an Indiana state police post. From the post, she was able to reach a cousin to give her refuge and was transported to that cousin’s house via snowmobile.It ended up taking her several days and more on-the-road misadventures to make the roughly 170-mile drive back home.So what did Dawn O’Hair Czanik – yes, she ended up marrying the boyfriend with whom she had the spat – learn from the experience?“I would have paid more attention to the weather forecast and planned ahead better! I probably would have left the day before, but young love is kinda stupid, ya know?”"

        "title": "‘I want to get off the plane.’ The passengers refusing to fly on Boeing’s 737 Max",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Ed Pierson was flying from Seattle to New Jersey in 2023, when he ended up boarding a plane he’d never wanted to fly on.The Seattle resident booked with Alaska Airlines last March, purposefully selecting a flight with a plane he was happy to board – essentially, anything but a Boeing 737 Max.“I got to the airport, checked again that it wasn’t the Max. I went through security, got coffee. I walked onto the plane – I thought, it’s kinda new,” Pierson told CNN. “Then I sat down and on the emergency card [in the seat pocket] it said it was a Max.”He got up and walked off.“A flight attendant was closing the front door. I said, ‘I wasn’t supposed to fly the Max.’ She was like, ‘What do you know about the Max?,’” he said.“I said, ‘I can’t go into detail right now, but I wasn’t planning on flying the Max, and I want to get off the plane.’”Pierson made it to New Jersey – after some back and forth, he said, Alaska’s airport staff rebooked him onto a red-eye that evening on a different plane. Spending the whole day in the airport was worth it to avoid flying on the Max, he said.Pierson has a unique and first-hand perspective of the aircraft, made by Boeing at its Renton factory in the state of Washington. Now the executive director of airline watchdog group Foundation for Aviation Safety, he served as a squadron commanding officer among other leadership roles during a 30-year Naval career, followed by 10 years at Boeing – including three as a senior manager in production support at Renton itself, working on the 737 Max project before its launch.But he’s one of a number of travelers who do not want to board the aircraft which has been at the heart of two fatal crashes, as well as the January 5 incident in which part of the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines plane blew out mid-air. The part – a door plug – was found to be missing four bolts that should have held it in place. Further reports of “many” loose bolts and misdrilled holes have emerged from the subsequent investigations into the Max 9 model after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered the grounding of 171 Max 9 aircraft with the same door plug.Experts agree that the Alaska incident could have been worse, and the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has warned that “something like this can happen again.”The previous model, the Max 8, was involved in two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people. The crashes were widely attributed to the malfunctioning of MCAS, an automated system in the Max designed to stabilize the pitch of the plane, overriding pilot input in some circumstances. Boeing accepted its liability in 2021 for one of the crashes.Weeks after the Alaska incident, Boeing CEO David Calhoun told investors on a quarterly call: “We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA at every turn… This increased scrutiny, whether it comes from us or a regulator or from third parties will make us better.”“We caused the problem, and we understand that,” Calhoun said. “Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.”In February, in the wake of the Alaska incident, the company removed the head of the Max program from his position and reshuffled other senior management figures.The move comes as critics have repeatedly said that the aircraft manufacturer is prioritizing profits over safety.The FAA is now “taking a holistic look at the quality control issues at Boeing to ensure safety is always the company’s top priority,” a spokesperson for the government agency told CNN. Representatives are on the ground assessing the production lines at Boeing’s Renton factory and Spirit AeroSystems, whose Wichita, Kansas factory made the door plug that blew off mid-flight in the Alaska incident.On February 28, the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to address quality and safety issues.Boeing told CNN: “Every day, more than 80 airlines operate about 5,000 flights with the global fleet of 1,300 737 MAX airplanes, carrying 700,000 passengers to their destinations safely. The 737 MAX family’s in-service reliability is above 99% and consistent with other commercial airplane models.”Of course, many thousands of people board Max aircraft with no concerns. But do other passengers care? It appears that enough do.The last time the Max was grounded – for 20 months, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 on a Max 8 in March 2019 – 25% of the 1,005 Americans questioned in a Reuters/Ipsos poll said that they had “not a lot” or “no” confidence in the aircraft – compared to 31% who did, and 44% who were unsure. The poll was taken in December 2020, shortly before the aircraft’s return to the skies.After being “told about the aircraft’s safety issues,” a further 57% said they would be somewhat unlikely or not likely to fly in a Max, according to the report. Nearly half – 45% – said that they would still be somewhat unlikely or not very likely to fly in it after it had been back in the air for six months. And 31% of all respondents said that they had little to no confidence that the Federation Aviation Administration (FAA) “puts passenger and crew safety first when determining whether an aircraft is fit to fly.”Most countries cleared the Max 8 to fly again by 2021, but three years on, there still appears to be negative public opinion about the Max.“It’s unsettling that there have been so many issues with this specific type of plane,” Stephanie King, a passenger on the affected Alaska Airlines flight, told CNN in January. “I hope something is done so that this doesn’t happen again.”Then there’s flight booking site Kayak, which has seen usage of its filter to deselect Max aircraft (models 8 and 9) during the booking process increase 15-fold since January, the company told CNN. The site introduced the filter in March 2019, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash.Doubts have also remained across the industry as a whole. Following the Alaska incident, a February AP-Norc poll regarding air travel safety found nearly a third of Americans surveyed answered “not at all” or “a little” when asked if they believe that airplanes are safe from structural faults. While planes were generally viewed to be as safe as cars or trains for means of transportation, fewer than two in 10 surveyed strongly agreed that planes are fault-free.Belén Estacio has boycotted the Max since the January incident. Shortly after the Alaska Airlines fuselage blowout, she was scheduled on a Max for a work flight.“My boyfriend didn’t want me to fly on it so I changed my travel plans to make sure I wasn’t flying on any type of Max,” she said.“It doesn’t matter which model, I don’t want to fly them.” To her, she said, “The Alaska incident was further confirmation that Boeing is still not being thorough and not fixing its issues.”Florida-based Estacio, who works in marketing, now checks the aircraft type before booking any flight. She’s made two trips since January.“The whole thing of, ‘If it’s not Boeing I ain’t going,’ it’s totally the opposite now,” she said. “I’m very happy when I’ve seen I’ll be flying an Airbus.”She says she’s not the only one in her circle, and says she knows people employing both “soft” and “hard” boycotts.“Some say, ‘Absolutely not,’ others say, ‘If I can change it, I will; if not I’ll just go on it.’”UK-based communications consultant Elayne Grimes is another with a personal boycott. Grimes, who travels regularly for work, was worried following the Max 8’s first crash in October 2018: Lion Air flight 610, in Indonesia, which killed all 189 onboard a plane in service for less than three months. Grimes – who’d previously worked in emergency crisis management – was immediately concerned about Boeing’s new aircraft, which had launched to great fanfare in 2017.“I actively sought out airlines that didn’t have the Max,” she said. When Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed in March 2019, killing another 157 people, it confirmed her resolve.In 2022, Grimes watched “Downfall: The Case Against Boeing,” a Netflix documentary directed by Rory Kennedy, which looked at the two tragedies and flagged concerns about the working environment at Boeing.“I watched that and thought [Boeing] was an organization putting profit before people, and thought, ‘That’s not for me.’ I don’t see myself flying one in the near future,” she said.While the FAA has cleared the Max to fly once more, Grimes believes that “its issues are not resolved.”“When the door came off and they called [the planes] in and found other aircraft with issues, I thought ‘Hmm,’” she said. “It’s just not an aircraft I’d want to fly.”Grimes is a self-declared “avgeek,” or aviation fanatic – and she’s not the only one monitoring the industry closely to have reservations. Elliot Sharod, who says he took 78 flights last year, is on the fence. “I wouldn’t exactly refuse to fly it, but I’d ideally fly an Airbus if given the choice,” he said.A former aviation journalist, who wished to remain anonymous for professional reasons, says they lost trust after the second crash.“After the first one, the predominant talking points were, ‘Oh, it’s got to be pilot error, or the weather – it can’t be the plane,” they say. “It was Boeing. I believed that everything coming out of Boeing had been tested and retested – it had to be something else.“Then the Ethiopian crash happened, and there was a bit of the same messaging, but finally it came out that actually it was the plane. I lost all trust at that point in the Max.”They say they still love flying the “older style of Boeings – the 777s and the original 737s.”“They were all designed back in the days when engineers ruled Boeing,” they say. “I feel I can trust them more than the Max.”“Would you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn’t.”They sound like the words of an anxious passenger in 2024. In fact, they were written by one Boeing employee to another in February 2018 – eight months before the Lion Air crash. (In the internal communications, their co-worker replied, simply, “No.”)In April 2017, in internal messages by Boeing employees working on the soon-to-be-released Max, another employee wrote, “This airplane is designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.” The same exchange included a reference to the aircraft’s “piss poor design.” A design tweak was labelled as “patching the leaky boat.”These internal communications were released as part of the 18-month investigation into the Max by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In a 238-page report, released in September 2020, the committee outlined “the serious flaws and missteps in the design, development, and certification of the aircraft.” The report highlighted five key themes, including “production pressures that jeopardized the safety of the flying public” and a “culture of concealment” at Boeing.At the time, Boeing said that the communications “do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable.” The company issued a statement acknowledging the committee’s findings and saying that the victims of the crashes were “in our thoughts and prayers.”Boeing said that when the Max 8 returned to service it would be “one of the most thoroughly scrutinized aircraft in history, and we have full confidence in its safety.”It added: “We have been hard at work strengthening our safety culture and rebuilding trust with our customers, regulators, and the flying public… We have made fundamental changes to our company… and continue to look for ways to improve.”The House Committee report also included concerns about the FAA and its “grossly insufficient oversight” over Boeing during the Max design process and in the period between the two crashes. The report said that “gaps in the regulatory system at the FAA… allowed this fatally flawed plane into service.”A spokesperson for the FAA told CNN: “The FAA made significant improvements to its delegation and aircraft certification processes in recent years and took immediate action following the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines door plug incident to address concerns about the quality of aircraft that Boeing and its suppliers produce.”Rory Kennedy followed the investigation from start to finish. The director of “Downfall” told CNN she didn’t have a “strong opinion” on the plane until she started making the documentary in early 2020.But, she said, “I was shocked by what we discovered… [it] was really disturbing.”Her film is a forensic investigation of the two crashes. “Downfall” interviews ex-Boeing staff and concerned pilots, who paint a picture of an accident waiting to happen. It follows the congressional hearings held as part of the House investigation, and interviews the victims’ families.Kennedy says that during the design process Boeing “went to great pains to hide [MCAS] and how powerful it was.” The stabilizing system was designed specifically for the Max, since the fuel-efficient engines being added to the 1960s-designed plane affected the trim. The House committee found that Boeing concealed its existence from the FAA, airlines and pilots.Additionally, after the Lion Air crash, FAA analysis in December 2018 predicted that without a software fix, a Max could crash on average once every two years over the course of its usage. Yet the plane was not grounded at the time.“Boeing and FAA both gambled with public safety,” House committee chair Peter DeFazio said in a 2020 statement.“We are already undertaking important initiatives based on what we have learned… these initiatives are focused on advancing overall aviation safety by improving our organization, process and culture,” the FAA said in a statement following the committee’s report.“[They] decided to keep the plane in the air, to save money and try to have a fix before the next plane crashed,” said Kennedy. “I interviewed [family members of the victims] as they were understanding that they knew this. Can you imagine?”“I would absolutely not fly that plane,” she told CNN. “I’ve not noticed the culture of Boeing has shifted from one that prioritizes finances over safety.”She says that one of the factors that pushed her to make the documentary, was “talking to pilots who were telling me, ‘Absolutely don’t get on that plane.’”And while she initially received pushback about the film, including from family and friends, “When the door ripped off the airplane, people said, ‘You’re so vindicated.’”Her research also highlighted production issues in the 787 Dreamliner – Boeing’s flagship long-haul aircraft, which debuted in 2011. As a result, she avoids that, too – and suggests that instead of confining their investigations to individual planes, the FAA and NTSB should be investigating Boeing as a whole.A spokesperson for the FAA said that it has blocked production expansion of the Max, and “is conducting enhanced oversight of Boeing and its suppliers. The agency is examining all aspects of Boeing’s three manufacturing lines and Spirit AeroSystems’ supplier activities. A dedicated team of approximately two dozen aviation safety inspectors is conducting these reviews at the Boeing 737 MAX facility in Renton, Washington, and at Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas.”Kennedy wants a “proper hearing” in Congress – similar to the one that investigated the Max crashes.“To me, what you really need is an investigation into the culture of Boeing, what’s happening at board level, and what kind of decisions are being made to continue to prioritize financial interests over the safety of consumers,” she says.Critics say that Boeing’s 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas saw the culture change from one that emphasized engineering prowess to one intent on watching the bottom line.Damning its “broken safety culture,” DeFazio said after the 2020 investigation that “Boeing – under pressure to compete with Airbus and deliver profits for Wall Street – escaped scrutiny from the FAA, withheld critical information from pilots, and ultimately put planes into service that killed 346 innocent people.”In 2021, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle criminal charges that the company defrauded the FAA when the Max was first certified.“The reason that [Boeing’s] culture is so damaging is because they are in a numbers game, and they want to make as much profit as possible at any cost. And for me, that cost me my friend,” says Deveney Williams.In March 2019, Williams’ friend, Samya Stumo, was onboard the Ethiopian Airlines flight. The pair had been due to move into an apartment together in Washington, D.C.“I avoid Boeing as much as possible – I try to get on an Airbus even if it costs more or is a different route,” said Williams.“I never knew about plane models prior to this, but I’ve educated myself onto how to see the model when buying a ticket. I’ve got friends who ask how they can switch flights, or figure out how to avoid flying on this. I’ve learned a lot – I don’t want this happening to anyone else.”For Williams, the Alaska incident was a “weird relief” – because it happened in the US. The aspersions that were cast on the pilots of the two crashes didn’t happen in January. “This time, it’s on American soil, I’m presuming it was an American pilot – so they don’t have any other fingers to point.”Torleif Stumo – Samya’s brother – had a similar incident to Ed Pierson, in which he says his plane was switched to a Max at the last moment. Like Pierson, he only noticed when he saw the safety card in the seat pocket of his flight from Panama City to Bogotá in August 2023.“I don’t really have anxiety, I’ve never had panic attacks but that was one of the closest times I ever came,” he says.“The crew were amazing. They had disconnected from the jetway and initially offered to change my seat to first class. But then I told them why I wanted to get off. They immediately understood and brought the plane back [to the gate].”Stumo ended up spending the night at an airport hotel. The airline he was traveling with agreed to rebook him fee-free having listened to a phone call he’d made to customer services when originally buying the ticket. In it, he’d been assured that he wouldn’t be on a Max.Williams and Kennedy both say they’ve had similar experiences with their aircraft switched to a Max at the last minute.Stumo believes that it’s not easy enough for consumers to tell whether they’ve been booked onto a Max. Michael Stumo, Samya and Torleif’s father, wants aircraft types to be “prominently displayed” during the booking process, he tells CNN.Following the January 5 incident, Alaska and United – the US carriers which use the Max 9 – issued waivers allowing passengers unwilling to fly the Max flexibility. These have now expired, but Alaska told CNN that concerned passengers can be rebooked onto a different aircraft for free, by calling reservations.“We have complete confidence in the safety of all our aircraft,” they added.A spokesperson for United said the airline “has no change fees on most tickets. We’re happy to work with customers with concerns to find a solution that works for them.”Pierson’s Foundation for Aviation Safety – established in 2023 as a watchdog for both the aviation industry and the government entities that regulate it – added a page to their website in February for passengers reluctant to fly on the plane. It explains how to check the plane assigned for one’s flight before booking, refusing to board, and rebooking at the airport.Pierson says the foundation gets many requests from the public asking whether it’s safe to fly the Max.The former Boeing employee has been critical of Boeing company since the aircraft was first on the production line. Over the summer of 2018, he sent several messages up the chain at Boeing, having noticed what he now says was an “unstable production line.” In emails which he has since shared publicly, Pierson warned of his concerns that the intense pressure to get planes out of the factory was leading exhausted workers to cut corners. He feared that it could end in tragedy, he wrote.Having taken early retirement in August 2018 – “I knew it was an unhealthy working environment and couldn’t support the leadership anymore,” he told CNN – he wrote again to the board of Boeing, as well as to the FAA, after the Lion Air crash, and then again after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. He later testified at the congressional hearing.“I would definitely not fly that plane,” he says now. “The same problems that I saw in 2017 and 2018 have not been resolved. The factory is still putting huge amounts of pressure on employees that build the planes, and they’ve had many production quality defects that just came to light.”Although the Max is flying once more, its future appears to be up in the air. The FAA has capped production of new aircraft, and launched an investigation “into whether Boeing failed to maintain their quality system in accordance with federal regulations.” It has also launched an analysis of “potential safety-focused reforms around quality control,” a spokesperson told CNN.As part of its “enhanced oversight,” FAA teams are reviewing Boeing’s Max production system, and Spirit AeroSystems’ production system for the aircraft’s fuselage. It is also reviewing employee training and qualifications, increasing its onsite presence at Max manufacturing facilities, and looking at “how Boeing transfers unfinished work from suppliers to its production lines,” a spokesperson told CNN.Meanwhile, the NTSB’s investigation into what happened on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 continues.A preliminary NTSB report does not lay blame on Boeing nor find a probable cause, which is typically included in the NTSB’s final report which could take a year or more.Spirit said following the incident it was cooperating with the NTSB and added, “as a company, we remain focused on the quality of each aircraft structure that leaves our facilities.”For Michael Stumo, the Alaska incident proved his fears. “We have nine years of [Boeing] getting caught, promising to do better, and they don’t,” he said. “Now we have this: where they can’t even put plug doors in a plane, can’t fix bolts.”Stumo wants Boeing to “bring in people who know how to do complex manufacturing processes.”“These people exist. Boeing has a lot of money. Hire them,” he said.A Boeing spokesperson said the company has “invested heavily in our workforce over the last several years.” Engineering staff are up by 10% and manufacturing by 11%, they said, while they have “increased the number of Commercial Airplanes quality inspectors by 20%, and have said we will continue to hire.”“We have also invested in quality across the company, growing the number of quality employees by more than 25%, exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels,” they added.Stumo says the company needs urgent change.“The first crash shouldn’t have happened. The second they had full knowledge of [the MCAS malfunctioning] – it absolutely shouldn’t have happened.“We want no third crash. And we want Boeing transformed back into the superior aviation engineering company making amazing and safe products that it was.”"

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "It rains an average of 171 days per year in Singapore. But one hotel in the Lion City is taking a gamble to ensure that rain doesn’t spoil its guests’ holidays.The InterContinental Singapore’s “Rain Resist Bliss” package will reimburse one night of a guest’s stay if one of their planned activities ends up getting rained out.“​​I was chatting with a group of friends about what’s next in luxury travel and one of them jokingly commented that being able to guarantee good weather would be the next level of ultimate luxury travel,” the hotel’s general manager, Andreas Kraemer, tells CNN. From there, the concept of a rain insurance package was born.Still, there are caveats. The InterContinental isn’t going to hand out cash every single time it rains. According to a release from the hotel, ​​the criteria is met when “rain duration exceeds 120 cumulative minutes within any 4-hour block of time during daylight hours.”The package also is only applicable to people staying in suites, which begin at 850 SGD ($633) a night for junior suites and start at 4,500 SGD ($3,349) for the presidential suite.The money comes in the form of a voucher, which must be spent at the InterContinental Singapore within six months, and the amount you get is equivalent to one night’s stay in your room category.Kraemer’s own personal rainy day favorite things to do in Singapore include visiting the Asian Civilizations Museum, taking a tour of Tiger Brewery and shopping at the local outpost of Japanese bookstore Kinokuniya.Special packages like these can be a way for an established hotel to stand out from the pack.In Bali, one hotel banned smartphones and other electronics by the pool as a way to encourage guests to unplug and relax.Meanwhile, several hotels and resorts around the world, including the Park Hyatt New York, have created special rooms designed for getting an optimal night’s sleep, complete with white noise machines, weighted blankets and special sleepytime teas."

        "title": "Meet Europeans who moved to the US and say there’s no going back",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "For all the stories of American families who’ve bid adieu to the United States to give their kids a different upbringing in France, decamped to Italy for a better lifestyle or made the move to Portugal to afford health care and retire on the cheap, there are plenty of Europeans who’ve crossed the pond and made America their home and say they’ll never return to the European continent to live again.Since CNN Travel regularly features expats “living the dream” in Europe, we decided to find out what the experience has been like for some of those seeking opportunities on the other side of the Atlantic.We spoke with a handful of Europeans who are embracing American life about what brought and ties them to the United States. Here’s what they said:Florian Herrmann, 44, originally from Munich, Germany, first came to the United States in 2006 as part of a university exchange and internship program in California.When that ended, he returned home to Germany before being recruited to work for a small family business in Wyoming.“I was always a career hunter, super career-focused,” says Herrmann, who eventually started his own tourism marketing business in the United States, Herrmann Global. “Everything changed for me when I came to America. People told me the sky is the limit, if you see it you can do it.”He finds the American spirit of “supporting the underdog” particularly powerful. Herrmann, who is still a German citizen, says he plans to pursue US citizenship when the option for Germans to have dual citizenship becomes easier.“The mentality here is ‘Let’s give it a try.’ And if it doesn’t work, they say, ‘Well, you did it and now you know it didn’t work,’” he says. By comparison, failing at something as an entrepreneur in Germany is something you “carry on your shoulders,” he says, and usually means less opportunity in the future.Herrmann, who lives with his American wife and their two kids in Lander, Wyoming, a small town that’s home to less than 8,000 people, says he feels fortunate to live in such a tight-knit community with a can-do, “cowboy mentality,” too.“Small town America is still absolutely amazing,” he says. “There’s a support system I just don’t see happening anywhere in the world. You know the police officer, the people from the courts, the neighbors. My friends will visit from Germany and see me waving to a police officer and wonder what I’m doing.”Although Herrmann loves the wilderness of Wyoming, he admits it can feel isolating at times. And while he would consider moving back to Germany for a year or two, he doesn’t think he could ever return there long term.“I have become too Americanized. I love my life and the way I live,” he says. “When I go back, I think, ‘I really couldn’t live here anymore.’”“I know that I will be buried here,” he adds. “I feel like an American. This country has done a lot for me, and I’m committed and thankful.”Gabriele Sappok, 54, founded Imagine PR in New York City in 2006 after leaving Stuttgart, Germany, to live with her German boyfriend (now her husband and business partner). The optimism of American life is what inspires her most.“I love my home country, but the general vibe in Germany is the glass is half empty versus here, where there’s this innate optimism that I cherish and love,” says the German citizen who has a US green card.When she’s back in Germany, Sappok says Germans complain about how Americans will casually ask how you’re doing “without really caring,” she says.“I explain to people there that it actually makes my day when people ask how I’m doing in the US, it’s a gesture I appreciate,” she says, adding that there’s a huge cultural divide between Europe and the United States, not to mention within Europe.“In Germany, it’s almost like it’s expected not to be happy-go-lucky all the time because then people doubt your sincerity,” Sappok says. “You have to have a certain level of cynicism and criticism because that’s what makes you smart.”She says she gets very upset when she sees Europeans “pooh-poohing” the United States.“This is a good country, it’s truly a good country,” she says. If she and her husband eventually move back to Germany, it will only be for the support of the social system there.“For us, in the end, it’s going to be a question of can we afford to grow old in the US and New York City in particular,” she says.Sappok is aware she benefited from things like free university education in Germany and “didn’t really pay it back,” she says, since she moved to the US early on to work and live.“There’s a little bit of guilt there, but as long as I can work and can do what I’m doing, I don’t want to move anywhere,” she says.The only things she says she misses from her home country are family and certain dishes, including the Swabian specialty called maultaschen, beloved in her native Stuttgart.“You can get a lot of things in the US, but you still cannot get those dumplings,” she says.Originally from France, Laurence Noguier, co-owner of the restaurant Bistronomic in Chicago, moved to the city in 1998 when she was 27.She also cites the spirit of American entrepreneurship as something she cherishes about her adopted country.“In the US if you have a project, the proper work attitude, a little common sense and the will to make it, you really find an audience, a support system and people telling you to ‘go for it!’ she says. “If they have connections or resources, they will share these for you to get to the next step.”France, by comparison, is a place where “you really need capital and connections to be an entrepreneur and the feature of failure is more inhibiting,” she says.But her love for the United States goes beyond the business possibilities.“I am an optimistic person. I can’t stand the ‘it was better before’ mentality,” she says.Noguier, who is 53, says she also experiences less ageism here than in France.“The US makes me feel relevant as a 50+ years old woman. Age is not a judgment. I feel empowered in the US, that I can be heard more than if I was in France,” she says.That said, she does find the “constant quest to be better, more efficient and more relevant” in the United States exhausting at times.And while the cost of health care in the United States compared with Europe is “quite exponential,” she says, “the cliches that there is no health care nor retirement in the US are actually false.”Her heart and soul are bound to two countries, says Noguier, who has a green card and is planning to pursue citizenship this year.“I feel more like an American when interacting with French people from France, and I want everyone to come here to the US and try to discover themselves in another world,” Noguier says. “Though I am proud to be European, I find myself, my personality, to be a much better fit in the US.”Clodagh Lawless, owner of The Dearborn tavern in Chicago, grew up in Galway, Ireland, and first came to America in 1998 after her parents secured visas for the family to move.She says living in the United States has afforded her the privilege to get to know and befriend people of many different ethnicities.“The US is a melting pot of people from many different cultures. That brings so much worldly education that cannot be found in any school or university,” says Lawless, who became a US citizen in 2017.Unlike the Ireland of today, she says, when she was growing up there, she didn’t have the opportunity to meet many people from other countries since Ireland was not yet a major destination for migration.She also prefers Chicago’s weather.“Growing up in the west of Ireland, it always seemed to be raining,” she says. “Living in Chicago for 27 years, I just love the two seasons, winter and summer.”She says while she’ll never say never, she cannot see herself ever moving back to Ireland full time.Her sons love being Irish-American, Lawless says, and are very proud of their Irish heritage as well as their “now-American” mom.“Becoming a US citizen was one of the proudest moments of my life,” she says. “Just knowing the opportunities and privilege that comes with being an American makes me teary eyed every time I speak about it.”Lorna MacDonald came to the United States in 1979 when she was just 17 from Penzance, England, aboard a 45-foot sailboat she used to traverse the Atlantic Ocean with her mother, father and brother.“There was no room for growth in what my family was doing in England, all my friends were leaving for Dubai or Australia at the time,” she says. “My dad always had an incredible sense of adventure.”The family landed in Singer Island, Florida, and were bound for the Chesapeake Bay but fell in love with St. Augustine, Florida, while sailing through.And that’s where they remain today. By 1981, the family had opened The Raintree, a beloved local restaurant MacDonald still owns, and by 1986, she’d become a US citizen.She returns to England regularly to visit school friends with whom she stays in touch, MacDonald says.“Last time, my one friend got everyone together at the pub. It’s crazy how the years go by and you still connect,” she says.But she says you “couldn’t pay her” to go back to live.“When I go home now and look at the hometown, it’s really kind of depressing,” she says of Penzance. “It’s not vibrant, the economy there is a lot worse than our economy here. It seems very much more oppressive than here, and the weather has a lot to do with it.”She also doesn’t miss the class structure she grew up with in England, she says.“Here you meet all walks of life every day. It’s less judgmental of people and more go with the flow,” she says.That said, England will always be home, MacDonald says.“But I refer to the US as home when I’m there.”Florida-based travel writer Terry Ward lives in Tampa and is working on getting her Italian citizenship."

        "title": "How this beautiful Spanish tourist city became the green capital of Europe",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Valencia has long been one of Spain’s sunniest cities, thanks to its prime location on the Mediterranean. Now, it can also claim to be the most sustainable after winning the coveted Green Capital of Europe title.The European Commission cited Valencia’s 5 million square meters of green space. According to the Commission’s Report, 97% of residents live less than 300 meters from a major green area. Whether that’s the popular wide sandy beaches of the Mediterranean or the marshy lagoon of the Albufera where Valencia’s paella rice is grown.The Green Capital title is given annually to a city in Europe that sets an environmental example for others to follow. The European Commission awards 600,000 euros ($656,000) to the winner to fund more sustainable programs. The real prize, however, is the marketing boost that comes with a city’s certified green credentials. Previous winners have included Tallinn, Estonia, and Oslo, Norway, among others.“I think it’s a recognition by the European Community of our common work,” says Paola Llobet, Valencia’s councilor for tourism and innovation. “It’s something that we, as a community, have been building for years, within neighborhoods. We have been protecting our orchards, our beaches, our sea, the Albufera natural park and more.”Would-be visitors need only to look at a map of the city to see the most striking example of Valencia’s green spaces: the Turia Nature Park, a nine-kilometer-long converted riverbed that cuts through the city.After a deadly flood in 1957, the river was redirected and the Turia was slated to become a multi-lane highway. Public opposition thwarted the development, however, giving rise to a movement that demanded more green space in the city center.Today, the Turia has become a treasured communal space: a green ribbon that connects the fruit orchards on the outskirts to the Mediterranean Sea. Weekends are filled with soccer, rugby and baseball games at one of the many sports facilities in the park. On a sunny day, families picnic under groves of baobab and cypress trees while rock climbers and amateur acrobats try their skills at clambering up or spiraling down some of the medieval stone bridges that still span the park.It is also home to the City of Arts and Sciences, the futuristic masterpiece of Valencian architect, Santiago Calatrava – now one of the city’s biggest attractions. Its bright white curves and skeletal supports give it a space-age design, making it a favorite shooting location for science fiction films and series, from “Star Wars” to “Westworld.”The Turia also functions as a sustainable transportation highway. Designated paths run along the length of the park making it ideal for commuters on bicycles and electric scooters to cut through the city and avoid street traffic.A love of cycling is what led Giuseppe Grezzi, an Italian transplant to Valencia, to get involved in local politics, eventually becoming the city’s councillor of sustainable mobility for eight years. His proudest achievement: increasing bike lanes in the city by more than 50%.“The city is flat. The weather is perfect! I wanted to be able to bike everywhere,” he said after attending a community meeting to discuss Valencia’s Green Capital status. “We transformed the city. I was proud to be part of it. We put in so many policies to protect public space, to make the city greener, with more pedestrian areas and to reduce pollution.”During his term, the city poured money into sustainable transport, expanding a new metro line, installing public bicycles and augmenting nearly 200 kilometers (120 miles) of bike paths that link to several “green routes” out of the city.During the pandemic, Valencia took the initiative to convert several high-traffic areas into pedestrian-only zones, including the city’s central roundabout, where Valencia’s City Hall, the Ayuntamiento, sits in an impressive 18th-century building.The other benefit of all that green is Valencia’s bounty of fruits and vegetables. The city is surrounded by La Huerta, more than 120 square kilometers of fruit orchards and vegetable plots whose produce is sold at Valencia’s municipal markets. The European Commission singled out the city’s neighborhood and food program as it pushes for Zero Kilometer food, a movement that advocates growing and processing food in the same place where it is sold and eaten in order to reduce transport costs and carbon emissions.Valencia’s Mercado Central is a good place to see that in action. Nearly 300 hundred fruit, vegetable, fish and meat vendors sell their wares in a huge modernist hall. The day begins before dawn, when hundreds of vehicles begin to unload fresh produce from the surrounding area, including bushels of Valencia’s famous oranges.Though it has become a popular tourist attraction, the Mercado Central is still used by locals. Roughly 80% of customers are local residents, according to the market.That includes a growing number of Michelin-starred restaurants in the city. In 2005, chef Begoña Rodrigo started her restaurant, La Salita, to showcase the local ingredients of the Valencian region. By 2019, Rodrigo won a Michelin star for her innovative menu that “elevates the cooking of vegetables to new heights.”There are still major environmental challenges ahead for the city, however. Not least of which is the shifting political environment.Valencia’s Green Capital proposal was initiated under the city’s previous administration, a coalition of left-leaning parties known as Compromis. Elections in 2023, swept into power a coalition between the center-right Popular Party (PP), and the far-right Vox, a party that has denied the existence of climate change.That worries Giuseppe Grezzi, the former councilor of sustainable mobility.“A lot of our projects have simply stopped. Many are now paralyzed by the current administration,” he said. “So, we are very worried about it, whether it will be continued. Because this strategy should not be partisan, not just attached to one party. All the city must be involved in it.”Paola Llobet, the current councilor of tourism and innovation says that while some projects are being reassessed, the current administration is still committed to achieving sustainability goals.“Maybe we have a different way of arriving at our goals, different public policies,” she said. “But the goal is still the same: to have a sustainable city and a better quality of life for the people who live here and the people who come here to visit us.”One flash point is Valencia’s commercial port and cruise terminal. A proposal to expand the port is under consideration, potentially bringing in tens of thousands of new tourists a year. The current administration is also exploring the possibility of adding new direct flights from the US to Valencia’s International Airport.Cities like Barcelona and Venice, however, have struggled to cope with the sheer number of tourists arriving. Even for those working in tourism there is concern that Valencia could suffer the same fate.“If they can put a limit on tourism, whether by cruise ship or plane, that may be necessary to have a cut-off,” one tour guide, who declined to be named, told CNN Travel. “I worry that at some point, the numbers become unsustainable.”For Llobet, that means using technology to ease the impact of tourism on Valencia. She has started a project to produce “heat maps” of the city that tourists and guides can use to show which areas are more congested, suggesting alternative routes and to encourage tourists to visit other sites in the city.“We have a lot of data. We are measuring air pollution; sound pollution and we are starting a project on carbon emissions.” Llobet said, “We want the impact of the tourists to be positive. You know, 70% of the employment in the city depends on the service sector that is absolutely linked with the tourists.”Perhaps the most visible environmental challenge is Valencia’s Fallas tradition, a springtime riot of noise, color and pageantry that carries a heavy environmental toll. Tens of thousands flock to the city every March to participate in a succession of elaborate parades and firework extravaganzas. Giant colorful statues are displayed in neighborhoods across the city, then set alight at the climactic end of the festival. The result is often plumes of black smoke from burning polystyrene and petroleum-based products.This year, in honor of its Green Capital status, Valencia is celebrating its first ever “Green Fallas,” providing funding for neighborhoods to build with environmentally friendly alternatives such as paper maché, wood and rice-stalks. The aim is to celebrate Fallas with entirely sustainable materials by 2030.This year, the Fallas centerpiece is a giant two-story statue now being built in front of City Hall called “2 Doves, 1 Branch.” An appeal for peace depicts a pair of white doves carrying an olive branch. The structure is built from wood, papier-mâché and Neops, a foamy alternative to polystyrene made from plant residue, such as waste from processing wheat and cereal grains.Still, it’s hard to put environmental limits on cherished traditions. After the interview, Llobet invited CNN Travel to the main balcony of City Hall to view the “mascletà,” a daily fireworks display during the first 19 days of the festival. Each day it’s hosted by a different Valencian neighborhood community, known as a “fallero.”Just before two in the afternoon, a group of specially selected “fallera,” young women and girls in elaborate traditional dress, accompanied the mayor to signal the start of the mascletà.After a single shot comes a steady volley of bangs, followed by the zipping scream of fireworks exploding into white stars, barely visible against the blue sky. What was visible, however, were billowing clouds of smoke. As local broadcasters on the balcony breathlessly explained, the art of the mascletà is not the light show but the rhythm and crescendo of sound, culminating in a deafening barrage of thrilling, thunderous noise and smoke.Llobet concedes it’s hard to make Fallas a truly green event, but they are aiming to make it a more sustainable tradition.“We are working with different ‘falleros’ to be better with the use of plastic and waste, the use of water. Every year, we try and improve it a bit more,” she said. “But we have more than 100,000 ‘falleros’ in the city. One in every plaza or square. So, really, it’s a way of life.”"

        "title": "‘World’s coolest’ street for 2024 named by Time Out",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "What makes a street “cool?” Is it a plethora of restaurants, bars, cafes you can spend hours dipping in and out of? Is it independent stores, selling wares you won’t find anywhere else? Or is it just a general vibe, a friendly warmth that’s hard to pin down, but which you know when you feel it?Time Out reckons it’s all of the above – the global media company’s put together its list of the “coolest streets in the world right now”, factoring in each street’s food offerings, drink options, cultural delights, nightlife and overall sense of community.To produce the 2024 lineup, the global listings guide’s network of editors and writers chipped in to make the case for their favorite streets in their respective cities.Claiming the top spot is buzzy High Street in Melbourne, with local Time Out Melbourne editor Leah Glynn praising the road’s “epic restaurants, hidden bars, live music venues and boutique shops” and what Glynn called a “warm sense of community spirit that means everyone feels welcome.”It’s not the first time a Melbourne-based street’s graced Time Out’s list, with Gertrude Street and Smith Street featuring in past iterations of Time Out’s rankings. Melbourne’s omnipresence led Glynn to suggest “Melburnians are spoiled for choice when it comes to well-trodden thoroughfares that deliver on food, culture and fun.”Melbourne’s High Street is located in the coastal Australian city and criss-crosses the suburbs of Northcote, Thornbury and Preston.Time Out praises the street’s “unique, something-for-everyone local businesses” from Casa Nata, which sells delicious Portuguese custard tarts to 1800 Lasagne – a restaurant born out of the pandemic that’s now a thriving pasta spot with outdoor seating.High Street’s also great for bar hopping, suggests Time Out, highlighting “intimate and exclusive” rooftop bar Gigi Rooftop and buzzing dance spot Francesca’s Bar.Marco Finanzio, the founder and managing director of Gigi Rooftop, told CNN Travel he first opened a spot on High Street 14 years ago, and back then was “dreaming of the area becoming an iconic destination.”Finanzio said he and his team “dearly love our street and community.”“This acknowledgment is a wonderful achievement for so many local businesses who have worked tirelessly to serve locals, navigate a pandemic and battle rising costs to create a vibrant street that has come out on top of the world,” he added.Ben Mathieson, of Francesca’s Bar, said it’s really “special that everyone now knows how cool our street is.”“My neighbors are all independent locally owned businesses, you won’t find any big corporate brands, a great mix of hospo, live music, retail, health and wellness and all the traders have each other backs,” Matheison told CNN Travel.Mathieson also shouted out the Melburnians who “make the street cool as much as we do.”“We don’t exist without the awesome locals,” he said.Coming in at number two on Time Out’s 2024 list is Hollywood Road in Hong Kong, home to incredible restaurants including Michelin-starred Tate Dining Room, as well as cultural site Man Mo Temple and the Mid-Levels Escalators, the world’s longest outdoor covered escalator system.Meanwhile, the number three spot is claimed by East Eleventh in Austin, Texas – lauded by Time Out for packing a lot into a short quarter-mile. On East Eleventh, Vintage Bookstore & Wine Bar gets a shout out as the ideal spot to grab a drink and dive into a new read, while Kenny Dorham’s Backyard is the perfect place to see live music in “a makeshift venue that feels like a permanent house party,” according to Time Out.Time Out also notes how some of the world’s busiest streets have changed for the better in recent years – with many becoming “more walkable and pleasant places to spend our time.”“Outdoor drinking and dining, at one point a temporary measure, has become a staple on many of the streets on our hotlist,” said Time Out, adding this walkability has been “bolstered by green initiatives like pedestrianization and low-traffic avenues.” Consell de Cent in Barcelona, Spain, which is number 10 on Time Out’s list, banned cars in 2023.For each street on its list, Time Out has recommended a range of fun things to do – from yoga at Ardha Bikram Yoga on Guatemala Street in Buenos Aires (number four) and drinking natural wines at hole-in-the-wall bar Small Shifting Space on Jalan Petaling in Kuala Lumpur (number six) to enjoying cream soda floats at Guuutara Coffee on Chazawa-dori in Tokyo (number nine).Time Out says the goal of the list is to celebrate “the avenues, thoroughfares, backstreets and boulevards where local life really thrives.”The full top 30 can be seen at Time Out’s website.1.

        "title": "This train goes nowhere. Now it’s a luxury attraction",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "South Africa is home to some of the most luxurious, nostalgic train journeys on offer anywhere in the world. But for certain enthusiasts, a train going nowhere is the country’s star attraction.Kruger Shalati: The Train on the Bridge is a hotel in Skukuza in Kruger National Park, one of Africa’s largest game reserves and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Comprising a set of train carriages renovated into 24 modern suites with balconies and a pool overlooking the Sabie River, it marries luxury accommodation with an intimate view of wildlife, including sightings of Africa’s “Big Five” — lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalos.Jerry Mabena, CEO of Motsamayi Tourism Group, which owns the hotel, says the venture harks back to the earliest days of the park, when steam trains would pass through Kruger in the 1920s on the Selati Railway Line.Trains were once vital for tourists accessing Kruger, and would even park overnight on the same bridge where the hotel sits today. A new railway line built on the edge of Kruger in the 1970s pushed the Selati line and bridge into retirement, but in 2016 an idea was formed to restore the bridge to its former glory.“The idea for us was to re-enact the experience in some form or another,” Mabena says. “When we had the opportunity to buy mothballed old carriages from Transnet — which is our rail logistics operator in South Africa — we couldn’t say no to the idea.”The carriages’ interiors have been renovated with a modern finish, albeit with a few Art Deco flourishes (“we were trying to find a look that is non-colonial,” says Mabena).If guests leave their curtains open, they can wake with the dawn and catch the first signs of life outside from east-facing floor-to-ceiling windows. The river is a wildlife focal point, meaning guests can spend all day lounging on balconies or swimming in the pool while checking out activity below. “Having hippos grunting underneath the carriage attracts people who want to be in the wild but don’t want to be immersed in the wild,” says Mabena.Nevertheless, many visitors strap on boots and head into the bush with a guide on a game drive.Staff including senior guide Thuli Mnisi were recruited as part of efforts to involve the local community in the enterprise. Mnisi had worked as a guide for other companies since 2014 before joining Kruger Shalati. “(It’s) totally different from other lodges,” she says. “When (guests) visit the train for the first time, it’s breath-taking, the view is unique.”Kruger National Park allows self-driving safari experiences, but Mnisi says there’s no substitute for having a guide. “We communicate with one another, we know where we can find the animals,” she says.“If you’re (on) a self-drive, you can just wander around Kruger National Park, and it’s a very big area. If you go with a guide, they know what they’re doing, they know where to find what and exactly at what time.”Gardeners have planted indigenous species on the hotel grounds and nurture a kitchen garden, with produce used in Kruger Shalati’s fine dining restaurant. Local delicacies served in the refined setting include crocodile, venison, and springbok carpaccio.“Mother nature is the true artist,” says chef Vusi Mbatha. “It’s one of those philosophies that we share: take simple ingredients and transform them into something amazing.”After development delays courtesy of Covid-19, the hotel opened in December 2020 and is welcoming guests for its fourth summer season.Double and twin rooms aboard the train start at 9,950 Rand ($530) per person, per night for international guests, with discounts for longer stays. One of the seven rooms in the adjacent Bridge House cost less. Rates include all meals, certain drinks, two game drives and airport transfers.If all this sounds like too much wildlife and not enough trains, Motsamayi Tourism Group also owns Kruger Station, just south of the bridge and home to the last train to operate in the park.Stranded after most of the tracks in the park were removed in the 1970s, the South African Railway Class 24 steam locomotive has lived many lives (including a funeral coach for a former prime minister) and now enjoys a happy retirement alongside a restaurant and bar.“The culture of steam trains and the culture of historical trains I think is beginning to re-emerge,” says Mabena.“We don’t have a moving steam train, but one day, I think we will.”"

        "text": "Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar, alone.“I’ll go for one song and suss it out,” she thought, trying to quieten her nerves.Kacie slipped in at the back. The club was dark and busy, a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking, dancing and chatting. Before she could even take in the musicians on stage, Kacie’s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar.“I walked in and he was there,” Kacie tells CNN Travel today. “We clocked eyes.”“Ciao,” said the stranger, smiling.“Ciao,” Kacie said back, before adding apologetically: “That’s all the Italian I’ve got for you.”It was October 2018. Kacie was a 24-year-old New Yorker on vacation in Florence. It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo. It was an exciting – and terrifying – experience.“I was a professional dancer in New York,” explains Kacie. “A very exhausting career – there’s a lot of toxicity, a lot of rejection, there’s a lot of politics that come into play – and I was feeling a little stuck, a little unhappy, a little – just stagnant, if you will.”Kacie spent her days auditioning, traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store. She needed a break, and she’d long felt a “pull” to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation.“I kept saying, ‘I’ll wait for somebody to go with, I’ll wait, I’ll wait. And then I was waiting for years. And so then one night – at two in the morning – I was like, ‘What am I waiting for? Life is too short.’ So I booked a solo trip to Italy.”Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence. But in the lead-up to the trip, she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at. This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city’s praises, persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint.And that’s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening.“I’m really glad that I listened to her,” says Kacie. “That’s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence, on that earlier day that I wasn’t originally supposed to be there.”The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was 26-year-old Dario Nencetti, a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights. It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week.The jazz bar, called Jazz Club Firenze, was one of Dario’s favorite hangouts. He loved the music, the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions.“That place is, let’s say, unconventional for Florence,” Dario tells CNN Travel. “Usually in Florence, there’s like a table for two or three or four people. In the jazz club, there are big tables, so you can sit with strangers and stuff, which I love.”When Dario realized Kacie didn’t know much Italian beyond “ciao,” they switched to English. Dario told Kacie he’d lived in Scotland for a year, and they got talking about travel. Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he’d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year.“We bonded from the beginning,” says Dario. “It was really natural, really easy conversation.”“I remember he made me laugh,” says Kacie. “And I was like, ‘Oh, this guy’s interesting.” So many people ask us, ‘How did you know?’ And I don’t know how I knew. I was just like, ‘Oh, this is something different.’”Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning. Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days.“He would meet me after his work – every night he got off at 11. And we would go out and we would just talk,” recalls Kacie. “I instantly fell in love with Florence. It’s a very romantic city - cobblestone streets and medieval buildings. It looks like a painting everywhere you look.”It was a whirlwind two days. One evening they sat by Florence’s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until 3 or 4 a.m. It was as though Kacie was in a film – somewhere between every millennial’s favorite “The Lizzie McGuire Movie” and classic Florentine romance “A Room with a View.”Then, the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip. It was still like something from a movie – only it wasn’t obvious this one had a happy ending.“I got on the train and he was standing on the platform. And I remember looking out the train, and I was so sad,” she says.As the train pulled away from the station, Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York.“I just met my future husband in Florence,” she wrote. “That’s the guy I’m gonna marry. I’m never gonna see him again.”Her friend tried to cheer her up.“You’re going to Rome,” she wrote. “You’ll meet a gladiator!”But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn’t replaceable.“We never stopped talking. We FaceTimed every single day,” she says.This continued when Kacie was back in the US. And before long, Dario was planning a trip to visit New York.On December 8, 2018 Dario arrived in the US. Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York.“It was really cool to see it through his eyes,” she says.“She showed me the real city,” says Dario.Then the couple flew to Miami for a week’s vacation.For Kacie and Dario, there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship.“It was never a decision to be made,” says Kacie.“It just went without saying,” agrees Dario. “But I can’t hide it, long distance was hard.”The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime, but tried to visit each other whenever they could.Cut to September 2019. Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie.“Why don’t I move here?” he suggested. He’d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get-go and could see himself there. The restaurant scene was incredible. If he could find a job and organize the visa, it seemed like the ideal scenario.Kacie thought so too, so Dario started asking around. He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. After a couple of months in limbo, his visa was approved.“Up until that point, every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic – we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other,” says Kacie. “Saying goodbye in airports sucked. It would take like a week to recover.”But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past.“It was really exciting,” says Dario.Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together, giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city.Then the pandemic hit. New York City’s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt. Stuck at home, Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another.As Kacie puts it, she and Dario found “many silver linings” in this tough time. Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta. They cat-sat. They spent long evenings chatting.But as 2020 rolled on, the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them. Dario’s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic, renewal was out of the question.For Kacie and Dario, it seemed like there were only three viable choices: return to long distance, get married or move to Italy.Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes, the last thing either of them wanted. And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future, they didn’t feel it was right for them at that point. That left moving to Italy.Kacie thought about her career in New York. Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight. And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing, Kacie only felt “relief” that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty.“That was a pretty big wake-up call,” she says. “I had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing.”On top of this, Kacie’s New York apartment lease was up. If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy, it was now.“Everything kind of fell into place,” she says.Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas. She applied, enrolling in Italian lessons. Then, Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic.Before stepping on the plane in January 2021, Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy. She’d never posted much on the platform before, but felt inspired to mark this significant life step.When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi-Fi, her cell phone was blowing up.“It went viral,” says Kacie.While stuck inside during mandatory two-week quarantine, Kacie continued posting TikTok videos. Her following continued to grow.While her social media presence was getting bigger, for the first few months in Florence, Kacie and Dario’s IRL world remained small. Italy was still in the thrall of Covid, with strict restrictions.But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work, Florence started to slowly reopen.“I remember the first time going to the Duomo. And there was nobody there,” says Kacie. “Which is crazy, because it’s like the main focus point of Florence. And there’s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was.”While that moment was surreal – even sad – Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together. They’d come a long way, and they were excited for their new life together in Italy.Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario’s family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly – even if, in the early days, Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario’s mother didn’t know much English.The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones.“They bonded immediately,” says Dario.Kacie continued to post on social media, and her following ballooned. After about six months, she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time.Dario encouraged this step.“I think it was a really good idea diving into it,” he says today. “It was the right moment, the right time, and I believed in her from the first moment.”Almost four years later, Kacie’s expanded her social media presence into a travel company, running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides. Meanwhile, Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant.“I really love the life we’ve created here,” says Kacie. “We live in a beautiful place with great food and he’s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me.”The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors, but they also savor their downtime. They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together.Dario and Kacie are settled in Florence for now, although they don’t rule out a move elsewhere in the future.“We’re enjoying the moment,” says Dario.“The solid thing is the fact that we know we’re in it together. And that’s what makes it so great,” says Kacie.She tells Dario: “I’m not nervous for what the future holds. Because I’ve got you.”Looking back, Kacie finds it serendipitous and surreal to think her spontaneous decision to travel solo in Italy led her to find a new career, a new home and the love of her life.“There were so many things that had to happen for it to actually happen, but it just felt normal and natural – like of course this is right and this was supposed to happen,” she says.“You never really know what life has planned for you. There’s so many good things waiting. You just have to trust it,” adds Kacie. “Trust in the process. And the path that is meant for you will happen, even if it’s not the path that you intended to take for yourself.”"

        "title": "After risky spine surgery the surgeon told her not to plan any travel. Here’s what happened when she didn’t listen",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "As she prepared for a risky spine operation around 18 months after sustaining injuries in a horrific 2011 car accident that left her in constant pain, Pamela Holt made a promise to herself.Not only would she be able to travel again within six months, she would make it to 80 countries by the time she turned 50.Holt, who was in her mid-30s at the time, had already visited around 55 countries, but the severity of her injuries had put her life, and her travels on hold.Shortly after waking up from the successful surgery, Holt, originally from California, was so determined to take a solo backpacking trip to the Middle East that she asked her mother to call American Airlines to book her a plane ticket.“The surgeon thought I was insane to book something six months in advance,” Holt tells CNN Travel.“He said, ‘There’s just no way you’re going to do this. “I said, ‘Yes, there is. Let’s make it happen. So I have something to look forward to.”“Having that positive attitude, I think helped with the healing. Because I had been in pain for a year and a half and quite frankly, I was ready to drive myself off a cliff. It just wasn’t worth living in that kind of pain.”Thankfully, Holt was well enough to make that trip in July 2013, and spent time in Petra, Jordan, which she describes as an “eye opening experience.”“I really, really enjoyed Jordan, because they were so excited and so welcoming to me as an American,” she says. “And I wasn’t expecting that.”She explains that her love of travel began during her early teens, when she visited Hong Kong with her family and celebrated her birthday in the country.“I think that’s where I got the travel bug,” she says. “I looked around and thought, ‘I want to live outside the bubble that I grew up in.’”Holt went on to take her first solo trip at the age of 19, traveling to Japan, where she lived for several months.“I would travel on my own during the weekends,” she says. “And then I ended up living in Japan again about three or four years later.”Holt, who was able to travel extensively while working as an actress, soon developed an intense passion for solo travel.“It [her travels] was mostly through working,” she says. “But I had always made solo travel a priority.“I literally worked to travel.”Of course, her life changed forever after the car accident, which left her near immobilized, and she was advised to get her affairs in order before undergoing surgery.“Going through something so traumatic and life changing – not only the accident, but then that spine surgery, it’s really scary,” she says.“It kind of makes you stop and ask, ‘Am I living the life that I want to live?’ “And I knew that solo travel had been the biggest joy for me in the past.“And it just really became even more of a focal point in my life after that.”Once she returned from that trip to the Middle East, Holt was even more determined to achieve her goal of visiting 80 countries by her 50th birthday, taking the vast majority of the trips by herself.So what is it about solo travel that appeals to Holt so much?“I love the adrenaline, the freedom and the joy of solo traveling,” she says. “You get to meet new people everywhere you go.“You get to challenge yourself. Build self confidence. I sound like a billboard for slow travel, but it’s shaped who I am over the years.“And the more positive experiences I had as a solo traveler, the more I wanted to do it again.”Holt goes on to explain that, as she was single for a long time, she often didn’t have anyone to travel with.And during the times that she was able to travel with friends, she usually found that they had different ideas on how they wanted to spend their vacations.“Most of them wanted to shop and eat,” she explains. “And I wanted to explore and dive into history and literally walk past the next corner and then see something and get to the next corner.“I wanted to go beyond my comfort level.”Rather than rushing from destination to destination, Holt is a big fan of slow travel.When it comes to destinations most suitable for solo travelers, she recommends Thailand, Bali and Vietnam.“It [the Far East] is sort of the solo traveler Mecca,” she says. “I think that it’s the best place to go for a solo traveler that’s wanting some adventure.“But there’s [also] a really good core of resources for solo travelers. Places to stay. Tours. Stuff like that.”Holt points to the European country of Italy as another fantastic location for those who are going it alone.“The reason I love it so much is, one, there is so much to do,” she adds. “And you really can, in the most positive way, lose yourself in Italy and soak in the flavor.”While Holt had been due to book her first Broadway tour before the accident, she struggled to revive her career back on track afterwards.“Trying to rebuild myself after that car accident took a long time,” she says.She eventually came up with a concept that combined her love of solo travel with her entertainment background, TV series ‘Me, Myself & The World: The Art of Solo Travel,’ which Holt both hosts and executive produces.The second season of the travel series, available on Amazon Freevee and GoTraveler, sees Holt exploring the backstreets of both Hanoi, Vietnam and Bangkok, Thailand, while meeting and talking with locals, as well as other solo travelers.Holt says she’s often contacted by budding solo travelers, particularly women, who are keen to travel, but can’t quite build up the courage.She explains that she advises people to “start small” and take a day trip somewhere nearby, before working up to a bigger trip to somewhere further afield,“Get used to relying on yourself, and being comfortable with yourself,” she stresses. “Some people don’t ever want to go out to dinner with themselves.“But if you just keep doing it, you’re going to build that confidence and you’re going to learn how wonderful it is.”Holt points out that many older people seem to view solo travelers as “a group of backpackers in their 20s, or the 40-year-old woman who had a midlife crisis,” stressing that there are many different types of solo travelers.“I’ve redefined solo travel to an acronym of, Seeking Out Life’s Opportunities,” she adds. “That’s what solo is. You can still be a partner or spouse to someone.“You can still be single. You can be anything you want. It’s about seeking out life’s opportunities for yourself.”However, she cautions those who are new to solo traveling to accept that while they may meet wonderful people who are willing to help them along the way, they will be primarily depending on themselves, and should always trust their instincts.“The biggest challenge is trusting yourself,” she adds. “Trusting your gut. Paying attention to your instincts.“I see a lot of solo travelers make the mistake of being nice, and overriding their instincts, when they should pay attention to that first.“You can always be nice and always be courteous. But pay attention to your gut and what it’s telling you about people and about surroundings.“If you get sick, or you lose your wallet. You’re on your own. So you have to become hardy. If you weren’t hardy before, solo travel will teach you to be very hardy.”In the 15 years or so between her spinal surgery and her 50th birthday, Holt was able to fulfill that promise she made back when she was in hospital, and opted to celebrate in style, flying into Bhutan, her 80th country, on the big day in August 2019.“I wanted to do something epic,” she says. “Because, honestly, I didn’t want to be that poor 50-year-old woman who didn’t have a partner. So I created my own joy. And I had a terrific time on my golden jubilee.”While Holt is now married – she reconnected with Brodie, who she first met when she was 15, shortly after completing her “80 by 50” challenge and the pair tied the knot in 2022 – she has continued to travel alone and still has the same joy for solo travel.“He travels about one to five weeks a year [for work],” she says, explaining that her husband owns a company and also works as a volunteer golf coach. “So the last thing he wants to do is travel [again].”“If we can do one international trip [together] a year, great. But I am happy to solo travel for a long time. And he’s happy to let me go.”Reflecting on that bleak period after her accident, when the prospect of being able to go anywhere seemed almost inconceivable, Holt says she has a completely different outlook now.“I really live life to the fullest,” she adds. “I take more chances in life. Travel is my foundation and it is continuing to shape me. Every trip I take, I am more understanding of people.“More open to everything that’s going on in this world. Especially right now, I have a totally different perspective because I have a world perspective.”"

        "title": "She thought she’d never see the stranger she met at the airport again. Then they unexpectedly reunited",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Christian Friese was standing in the arrivals area in Honolulu Airport, Hawaii, peering at a large airport map.“You are here,” read the sign above the map.Christian was assessing the airport layout, working out where she needed to go next, when, out of the corner of her eye, she spotted a man wearing a Hawaiian Airlines uniform, walking her way.Then, the man was at her side – tall, friendly and smiling.“Excuse me,” asked the stranger, “Do you need any assistance?”Christian turned to look at him properly and was momentarily taken aback.“He was perfection,” Christian tells CNN Travel today. “He smiled with his whole face. I couldn’t believe he was talking to me.”It was summer 2015, and Christian was on a solo vacation to Hawaii. She didn’t usually travel alone, preferring to have a gaggle of girlfriends close by – but this trip was an exception. The previous year, Christian’s mother had passed away suddenly, and Christian had spent several months trying to process this loss.“It was because my mom had passed that I thought, ‘I just need a break,’’ says Christian.So she’d packed her suitcase, left her home in Portland, Oregon and flown more than five hours to Honolulu. From there, Christian was set to travel to the island of Kauai – known for its beautiful cliffs, sprawling rainforest and stunning mountain ranges.But first, Christian needed to figure out how to get to the gate for her connecting flight.She explained this last part to the tall, smiling man now standing at her side, offering assistance.“He asked me what I was looking for, I told him, and then he said he could walk me to my gate,” recalls Christian.Christian obliged, and as they set off together towards the gate, the airport stranger introduced himself as Aaron.A Hawaiian Airlines flight attendant from the Big Island, Aaron Malulo had actually worked Christian’s flight from Portland, but neither of them had spotted each other on board.Instead, Aaron first noticed Christian when she was standing by the airport map, looking a little lost.“I thought that she was cute,” Aaron tells CNN Travel today. “And I thought that I could probably help her – because I’m at that airport every single day, so my chances of being able to offer assistance were really high.”Christian’s gate turned out to be pretty far away, and it took 10 minutes or so to walk over there. But Christian and Aaron barely noticed the distance, or the time passing – they were absorbed in conversation the whole way.“We had a really easy, natural conversation,” says Aaron.As they walked, both pulling wheelie suitcases behind them, Christian explained she’d lived in Hawaii as a kid – her dad had been stationed there in the US military. Aaron, who was from the Big Island, but knew Kauai pretty well, gave Christian his tips on the best things to see and do there.“We just chatted as we walked to the gate,” Christian recalls. “And then when we got there, we shook hands. And we only got each other’s first names. So he just said, ‘Have a good birthday. Nice to meet you.’”Christian thought that was sweet – she’d mentioned, in passing, that it was her birthday the following day.“Have a nice life,” she replied, only half-joking.As Aaron walked away, the thought briefly crossed his mind that perhaps he should have asked Christian for her contact details – but he quickly dismissed it.“I just walked away appreciating the moment, instead of second guessing myself about whether I should have done more,” he says.And as Christian headed to her connecting flight, the same thought crossed her mind.“I think I was wrapped up in our conversation and was having such a nice time, I didn’t think to even get a last name,” says Christian. “And I didn’t look to see if he was married either.”Christian didn’t think she’d ever see Aaron again – he said he wasn’t scheduled to work her flight back the following week, so it wasn’t obvious how their paths would ever cross again.But after briefly toying with regret, Christian refocused on her next flight and the vacation ahead.She decided to view the interaction as a good sign of what was to come – an unexpected moment of levity, excitement and kindness kicking off her trip, beginning a new chapter.Christian spent the next several days enjoying Kauai. As she relaxed on sandy beaches, swam, hiked and ate well, she reflected on her mother, on their close relationship, on her childhood in Hawaii.“I spread her ashes too, while I was there,” says Christian. “And so it was cathartic for me, a nice little retreat for myself.”Every so often, Christian thought about the airport stranger – she remained grateful for his friendliness and she followed all his Kauai tips.Then, it was time for Christian to head home. She took an early morning flight from Kauai to Oahu. At Honolulu Airport, she just had time to grab a breakfast sandwich before heading to catch her connecting flight home to Portland.As she walked down the jet bridge to board her flight, brushing crumbs off her clothing, Christian spotted him right away: Aaron, standing at the end of the walkway, right in front of the airplane, greeting the boarding passengers.Christian couldn’t believe it. First, she was surprised, Then she was flooded with happiness. And then she regretted the breakfast sandwich, and her casual airplane attire.“I just remember thinking, ‘If I’d known he’d be there, I would have looked cuter, I would have brushed my teeth,’” says Christian, laughing. “I wasn’t expecting it.”As Christian approached the plane, Aaron spotted her. He smiled – the smile that had won Christian over on their first meeting, the smile that lit up his whole face.It was true, Aaron wasn’t supposed to be working that day. But then the night before, his work system had flashed up that a flight attendant was needed on that day’s flight from Honolulu to Portland. Someone had dropped out, and someone else needed to pick up the shift.When Aaron saw the notification, he immediately thought of Christian.“I remembered that was the day she’d said she was flying back,” recalls Aaron. “And I thought ‘You know, we had such a nice conversation the first time. I want to see her again.’ And so I picked up that trip, that shift – and that’s how I got myself on her flight.”As Christian made her way down the jet bridge, she wondered what she should say to Aaron when it was her turn to board the flight. In the end, she just said hello, and he said the same back – but it was obvious they were both happy to see one another.Then, over the duration of the five and a half hour flight, Aaron kept coming over to say hello again, to check in on how Christian was doing, to chat a little about her time in Kauai.Meanwhile Christian, who’d planned to sleep through the flight, didn’t close her eyes once.“I just kept watching him, walking around the cabin,” Christian recalls. It was obvious Aaron was popular with his colleagues. Some passengers who were regular on the route knew him on a first name basis. Christian was charmed by this. She already liked him, now she liked him even more.“And all the while, I was wondering if it was intentional or not, that he’d ended up on my flight, because he didn’t say. And so the whole time I thought, ‘What is happening?’” she says.Aaron wanted to talk to Christian, to chat properly during the flight. But it wasn’t really the right place. He was working, for one, plus “it’s awkward to stand and have one person be seated and to carry on a significant conversation,” he says.He realized all the plane journey could be was “a place to touch base and just make sure she’s doing okay.”As the flight prepared to land in Portland, Christian decided to be assertive – whether Aaron was on the flight thanks to his own doings, or thanks to fate, she didn’t want another meeting between them to go by without them swapping contact details.So she dug out a business card from her bag. On the front were her contact details, including details on her realtor job back home in Portland. On the back, Christian scribbled a message:“Thank you for taking good care of me,” she wrote. “It was so nice to see you again.”As Christian got off the plane, she said goodbye to Aaron, met his eye, and then slipped him the card.For Aaron, this was a “great sign.”“I didn’t have a plan,” he says, “And so I’m glad that she took the initiative to keep the ball going by giving me her contact information.”Later, when he got off work, Aaron sent Christian a message:“I was hoping you’d be on my flight again,” he wrote.From there, Aaron and Christian texted a little bit back and forth, but then the conversation reached a bit of a stalemate. Aaron was busy flying. Christian’s out-of-office was no longer on and she was back to her day job, busy selling Oregon real estate.Then, one evening, Aaron looked Christian up online – her business website was listed on the card she’d given him.“And in her little bio on the website, she mentioned that she had gone to Oregon State University,” recalls Aaron. “I also went to Oregon State – at a different time. So I decided to send her a message and say that we had that in common.”As it happened, Aaron’s message came through while Christian was at an Oregon State pep rally. She stared at the message in disbelief – the fact she and the stranger she’d met at the airport in Hawaii were both Oregon State alumni seemed like a huge coincidence. She texted back right away.“I’m literally at an Oregon State pep rally right now,” replied Christian. “And I have tickets to the Beavers playing Michigan next week.”The Beavers – Oregon State’s football team – were playing the University of Michigan at Michigan’s homeground. Christian had been planning to go along with an old college friend, but the friend canceled at the last minute. At first, Christian had been disappointed – but now it felt serendipitous: Christian asked Aaron if he wanted to go to the game with her instead.“Had she not backed out, I never would have invited him,” says Christian today. “But I had the game tickets. And I had the hotel lined up. And so I said, ‘Oh, you’re a Beaver? I’m going to this game. Do you want to meet me there?’ And he says ‘Yes.’”A week later, Christian and Aaron made their way to in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Aaron flew all night to make it there from Hawaii. On the journey over, he felt “nervous.”“But I was game for a new opportunity and just trying to see what would happen next, and keeping it alive,” says Aaron. “I thought watching a football game would be fun, and a great way to see her again.”“I felt nervous too,” says Christian. Their text interactions had been fun, but brief. They hadn’t spoken on the phone or via video call. On her flight over, Christian considered that she still didn’t really know much about Aaron, beyond what she’d learned in their 10 minute airport conversation.“He had no social media presence – I couldn’t look him up or anything, as he doesn’t use it,” she says. “But we both just went into it looking forward to it from the last time we saw each other – which was about three weeks before at the airport. It was exciting.”And as soon as they reunited, Christian and Aaron’s nerves faded away. The easy connection they’d felt at the airport returned, effortlessly.The game “was a dud,” as Aaron puts it – Oregon State lost. But the uninteresting game gave Aaron and Christian plenty of time to connect.“We talked a lot about our lives,” says Aaron.“We lost the game,” says Christian. “But we won at love.”Over the rest of the weekend in Ann Arbor, Christian and Aaron wandered around, chatting.“We didn’t have a rental car and so we walked everywhere in the little town – to get food, to go to the game. And so we always had time to talk,” says Aaron.“I remember thinking he was fun to travel with,” recalls Christian. “And we were both in similar situations – no kids, hadn’t been married before. So we just talked about life, and Oregon State, until it was really late. He’s easy to be around. I really love college football, and he does too. And I’d always wanted someone to share that with me.”All too quickly Sunday came around and Christian and Aaron traveled to the airport together to board separate flights – Aaron back to Hawaii, and Christian back to Oregon.“We parted ways at the airport,” recalls Aaron. “I got on the train in the airport – one of the little terminal trains. And that was it – that was the end of our fun weekend.”As they said goodbye, Christian teared up.“He was getting on the train in one direction, I was getting on the other train and so we just parted – kind of dramatically,” she says. “I remember crying and thinking, ‘Why am I crying?’ But it just was a really, really nice weekend.”Christian calls the few days with Aaron in Michigan, “light and perfect.” She wanted to hold onto the feeling she had when she was with him, but she wasn’t sure what the future held.“I thought maybe this is just our little season – that one, really fun weekend.”But while they didn’t make any promises to meet again, once they were back in their respective homes, Christian and Aaron “just naturally kept in touch.”Before long, Aaron was visiting Christian in Portland. And soon, he was staying with her whenever he had layovers in the city.That fall, Aaron and Christian went to several more Oregon State football games, meeting in Arizona, California and Washington.The fact Aaron flew around the US as part of his job – plus the fact Christian’s realtor role offered work flexibility – made meeting up relatively straightforward. Aaron and Christian were able to gradually get to know each other over a series of visits.“I don’t really feel like we talked specifically about how this would work. I think we just started to make it work for us,” says Aaron. “And what I remember that being like was just us spending more and more time together.”“We didn’t have a label on the relationship,” says Christian. “But I told everyone about him, showed them pictures of us, and they were just so happy for me.”For the next two years, Christian and Aaron “just had a lot of fun, traveling back and forth together,” as Christian recalls.Then, in 2017, the two bought a house in Portland together. They decided Aaron would base himself with Christian in Portland, and he could still work for Hawaiian Airlines and fly back and forth from Hawaii whenever needed.Then, that Christmas, Aaron proposed to Christian while in the kitchen of their new home.“I knew here in the kitchen was the most perfect place, just us and our cat – he was our witness,” says Aaron.There was “lots of crying, lots of laughing,” he says.“I was really surprised. And I felt very happy,” says Christian. She and Aaron had talked about marriage, but she wasn’t expecting a proposal that day. It was low key, intimate and perfect.Aaron set up his iPad to record the moment, but the video didn’t work – the recording cut out right before the proposal.“But then I remember thinking that, you know, that just makes this moment ours,” says Aaron. “So it’s kind of more special.”The following year, Aaron and Christian got married in Hawaii, on the island of Oahu –not far from where they’d first met at the airport.“The theme was ‘love is in the air,’” says Christian, who took Aaron’s name when she got married, becoming Christian Maluo. “It was a vintage travel-themed wedding.”Before the wedding, the couple organized a photoshoot at Honolulu Airport.“We took pictures everywhere that we’d walked that first time that we met,” Christian recalls. “Being that our story was so much about flights and airports, I thought it was just perfect to have a travel-themed wedding.”The wedding decor incorporated the travel theme too, with airplanes and world flags hanging from the ceiling.Today, Christian and Aaron live together in Portland, Oregon with their son Cruz, who just turned one.When they got married, Christian and Aaron knew they wanted to have children, but it was a little while before Cruz came along.Christian calls their son “a miracle.”“I think something with us is that timing played a huge role in everything all along,” she says. “And the same with Cruz – we were just waiting for him, and he took a long time, and then he seemed to come at the perfect time.”Christian and Aaron remain avid Oregon State football fans – they often attend home games, and occasionally travel to away games too, with their son in tow too.“He goes to all the games with us, he has little headphones to block the sound,” says Christian, who suspects Cruz will take after his parents when it comes to a love of travel.“We’re hoping and looking forward to taking him to even more places together,” she says.Today, when Christian’s cheering on Oregon State, her arms around Aaron, holding on to Cruz, she sometimes feels emotional, thinking how all this happened “just because I went for a walk with a stranger in an airport.”She says reflecting on meeting Aaron at Honolulu Airport, in the wake of her mother’s death, is a reminder that sometimes “all the pieces will fall into place, if you just let them and never force anything, just let things roll out in front of you. And it can just be a beautiful story. It just was different than what you were expecting.”Aaron says that day at the airport, he and Christian were “just two people just trying to keep going forward, and just trying to find what they’re looking for.”Christian agrees.“Meeting Aaron just felt exactly what my heart and my soul needed after the rough year. And I just think it was just my life unveiling itself,” she says."

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Miami-Dade County told the Dolphin Company, which runs the Miami Seaquarium, in a letter on Thursday that the county is terminating the company’s lease for the property because of violations in how it is maintained.Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said in a news conference that terminating the lease is the best path forward for the safety of the animals, residents and visitors.The Dolphin Company has been told it must vacate by April 21.The Seaquarium is home to roughly 500 animals that include fish, birds, reptiles and marine mammals, Levine Cava said. It is located on the island of Virginia Key in Biscayne Bay.All the animals are owned by the Dolphin Company, and it is up to them what happens to them, she said. The mayor added that the county is working on contingency plans in case any animals are left behind when the company vacates.Eduardo Alberto, CEO of the Dolphin Company, posted on social media platform X during the mayor’s news conference that “we are outside and anything she haas [sic] to say about @MiamiSeaquarium we have the right to hear and be heard. … Waiting outside your office mayor. Dare to speak in front of us.”“The current state of the Miami Seaquarium is unsustainable and unsafe,” Levine Cava said during the news conference. “Meanwhile, our number one priority continues to be the safety and wellbeing of the animals, and moving forward we’ll do everything we can to ensure that they are well cared for.”The Seaquarium has failed to maintain the Flipper Stadium, Manatee Tank Area and Dolphin Stadium, the county said. Other violations include several structures not being maintained property, and dangerous conditions have resulted in injuries to some animals, the county said.There are also decaying animal habitats, lack of veterinary staff and lack of experience by some staff handling the animals, Levine Cava added.In statement sent to CNN late Friday afternoon, Albor contested many of the violations.He said that on March 11, “the tenant will deliver proof to the landlord that none of the defaults or violations occurred, have been cured, or are in the process of being cured during the period specified in the contract.“Consequently, there are no grounds for lease termination, and the tenant will maintain possession and operation of the Miami Seaquarium for the remaining duration of the lease agreement, or until a court ruling dictates otherwise.“We are confident that upon receiving our response with proof of compliance, the landlord will honor the lease agreement,” the statement said.The Seaquarium was home to Lolita, a killer whale that was taken from the ocean in 1970.Last year, Lolita was set to be released back into the ocean after animal welfare activists fought for her release. Lolita died before she could be released.The advocacy group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) celebrated the news in a posted statement on its website on Thursday.“After more than 50 years of miserable animals and false promises to clean up its act, the Seaquarium’s impending shutdown is overdue,” said PETA Vice President Tracy Reiman. “And PETA looks to Miami-Dade County authorities to keep up the good work by ensuring that these animals are sent to reputable facilities where they’ll get the care they so desperately need.”CNN’s Rebekah Riess contributed to this report."

        "title": "Spring equinox: First day of spring ushers in longer days and ancient ways",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "For those of us who approach things by the Goldilocks Principle (not too little, not too much), spring equinox is practically perfect.Along with the fall equinox, this is when we get that glorious balance of daytime and nighttime all over the world – from the steamy equator to the frigid poles – with just about 12 hours of each. No one goes through the extremes like you see with the winter solstice or summer solstice.In 2024, spring equinox is either on Tuesday, March 19, or Wednesday, March 20. All that depends on where you’re located.The spring equinox will arrive exactly at 3:06 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on Wednesday, March 20, according to EarthSky.For the vast majority of people in the Western Hemisphere, that places the equinox on Tuesday, March 19. Here’s a breakdown of times and dates at select cities around the world (adjusted for Daylight Saving Time):• Anchorage (Alaska): 7:06 p.m. Tuesday• Las Vegas (Nevada): 8:06 p.m. Tuesday• Guadalajara (Mexico): 9:06 p.m. Tuesday• Chicago (Illinois): 10:06 p.m. Tuesday• Toronto (Canada) and Jacksonville (Florida): 11:06 p.m.For time zones east of the above, the equinox falls on Wednesday, March 20. Some more places:• Halifax (Canada): 12:06 a.m.• Dublin (Ireland) and Accra (Ghana): 3:06 a.m.• Berlin (Germany): 4:06 a.m.• Alexandria (Egypt): 5:06 a.m.• Ankara (Turkey): 6:06 a.m.• Dubai (United Arab Emirates): 7:06 a.m.• Mumbai (India): 8:36 a.m.• Chiang Mai (Thailand): 10:06 a.m.• Hong Kong: 11:06 a.m.• Tokyo (Japan): 12:06 p.m.Don’t see your city represented? Click here to look up the exact moment of the spring equinox where you’re located.Folks in the Northern Hemisphere are looking forward to longer days, perfumy flowers and a burst of greenery. But for people living south of the equator, this equinox means they are heading into fall.So for Chileans, South Africans and Australians, among others, this is a time to embrace cooler autumn weather.For people who reside near the equator in places such as Quito, Ecuador, or Singapore, none of this is really a big deal. They get roughly 12 hours of daylight and nighttime year-round.If you ever hear anyone say “vernal equinox,” it means the same thing.The term equinox comes from the Latin word “equinoxium,” meaning “equality between day and night.” And vernal also comes from Latin and means “spring.”The Earth rotates along an imaginary line that runs from North Pole to South Pole. It’s called the axis, and this rotation is what gives us day and night.However, the axis tilts at 23.5 degrees, as NASA explains. That positions one hemisphere of the planet to get more sunlight than the other for half of the year’s orbit around the sun. This discrepancy in sunlight is what triggers the seasons.The effect is at its maximum in late June and late December. Those are the solstices, and they have the most extreme differences between day and night, especially near the poles. (That’s why it stays dark for so long each day during the winter in places such as Scandinavia and Alaska.)But since the winter solstice three months ago in December, you’ve probably noticed that our days have been getting longer in the Northern Hemisphere and the nights shorter. And now here we are at the spring equinox!Going forward, the Northern Hemisphere will be more exposed to the sun than the Southern Hemisphere. That’s why it gets increasingly warmer as we head toward the summer solstice in June.Bonus time! It turns out you get a tad more daylight than darkness on the equinox – and how much so depends where you are on the planet.How does that happen when it’s supposed to be 12 hours of day and 12 hours night?As the US National Weather Service explains, the “nearly” equal hours of day and night are because of the complex way a sunrise is measured and the refraction of sunlight in our atmosphere.This bending of light rays “causes the sun to appear above the horizon when the actual position of the sun is below the horizon.” The day is a bit longer at higher latitudes than at the equator because it takes the sun longer to rise and set the closer you get to the poles.We got that truly equal day/night split a few days before the official spring equinox. That’s called the equilux.Humans have had a love affair with spring and all thing celestial.In Mexico, the Mayan site Chichén Itzá has special equinox ties. At the site, the impressive pyramid known as El Castillo was aligned so that a shadow outlining the form of a snake of light (Kukulcán) descends the steps on the equinoxes.In England, the mysterious stone structure of Stonehenge has been a popular gathering place for solstices and equinoxes for ages. English Heritage currently organizes the events.On the Mediterranean island Malta, an ancient megalithic temple in the Mnajdra complex is aligned so that the rays of the morning sun of the spring and fall equinox shine directly through the main entrance.Cultures around the world celebrate the equinox. Here are a few:In Japan, Vernal Equinox Day is a public holiday (on Wednesday, March 20, this year). Many people still adhere to old traditions such as visiting family graves and holding family reunions to mark the spring equinox.Nowruz is the Persian New Year. Also known as Nauryz, Navruz or Nowrouz, it means “new day.”It’s no coincidence it falls on the first day of spring. The Iranian calendar is a solar calendar, meaning time is determined, through astronomical observations, by Earth’s movement around the sun. So, the first day of the year always kicks off with the vernal equinox.It’s a celebration of new beginnings: wishing prosperity and welcoming the future while shedding away the past. That’s why families use this time to deep clean their homes and closets and buy fresh clothing.In China, trying to stand an egg upright is a popular game during the spring equinox, according to VisitBeijing.com. The custom is thought to go back thousands of years, and it’s believed that if people can get an egg to stand, they will have good luck. And people across China eat local spring vegetables."

        "title": "Galapagos Islands to double tourist entry fees amid concerns over rising visitor numbers",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Tourists to the Galapagos Islands will be asked to pay twice as much in entry fees from this year amid concerns that a rise in visitor numbers is putting pressure on the ecologically sensitive destination.Ecuador’s Ministry of Tourism has announced the new fees, which will take effect on August 1, 2024.The entry fee will go from $100 to $200 for nationals of almost all countries, except for other members of the South American trade bloc Mercosur, which includes Argentina, Brazil, and Peru.Mercosur members will now have to pay $100 per person, up from $50. Children under age two can visit for free, regardless of nationality.This is the first increase in Galapagos entry fees since 1998.“The Galapagos Islands are not only a national treasure but a global one. It is our collective responsibility to protect and preserve this unparalleled ecosystem for future generations,” Niels Olsen, Ecuador’s tourism minister, said in a statement shared with the Galapagos Conservation Trust.Olsen added that the additional money will go toward conservation efforts for the islands, which are 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) off the coast of mainland Ecuador.The Galapagos are a UNESCO World Heritage site comprised of more than 100 islands. The islands, nicknamed a “living museum,” are home to many rare or endangered plants and animals.Only some 30,000 people live on one of the Galapagos islands, but about 170,000 tourists visit in a typical year.The Galapagos Conservation Trust, a UK-registered charity focused on promoting conservation and sustainability on the islands, has warned of ecological consequences from rising visitor numbers.“Recent years have seen worrying growth in the number of visitors to the Islands, driven by a sharp increase in land-based tourism,” it said on its website.“This is pushing waste management systems to the limit, exacerbating water and food insecurity, and increasing the threat of devastating invasive species being introduced to the Islands.”Scientific discoveries continue to be made in the archipelago. A previously unknown coral reef, believed to be thousands of years old, was discovered by scientists last year.In 2021, UNESCO issued a report on the islands and the state of conservation efforts there. The report commended the Ecuadorean government for reducing illegal fishing and controlling the spread of invasive species but had requested an update by 2024.The destination’s global profile could be raised this year by a new movie, directed by Ron Howard, exploring a true-life story of scandal, sexual liberation and murder which unraveled on a Galapagos island in the 1930s. “Eden,” to be released later this year, is set to star Sydney Sweeney, Vanessa Kirby, Ana de Armas and Jude Law."

        "title": "50 of the world’s best breads",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "What is bread? You likely don’t have to think for long, and whether you’re hungry for a slice of sourdough or craving some tortillas, what you imagine says a lot about where you’re from.But if bread is easy to picture, it’s hard to define.Bread historian William Rubel argues that creating a strict definition of bread is unnecessary, even counterproductive. “Bread is basically what your culture says it is,” says Rubel, the author of “Bread: A Global History.” “It doesn’t need to be made with any particular kind of flour.”Instead, he likes to focus on what bread does: It turns staple grains such as wheat, rye or corn into durable foods that can be carried into the fields, used to feed an army or stored for winter.Even before the first agricultural societies formed around 10,000 BCE, hunter-gatherers in Jordan’s Black Desert made bread with tubers and domesticated grain.Today, the descendants of those early breads showcase the remarkable breadth of our world’s food traditions.In the rugged mountains of Germany’s Westphalia region, bakers steam loaves of dense rye for up to 24 hours, while a round of Armenian lavash made from wheat turns blistered and brown after 30 seconds inside a tandoor oven.Ethiopian cooks ferment injera’s ground-teff batter into a tart, bubbling brew, while the corn dough for Venezuelan arepas is patted straight onto a sizzling griddle.This list reflects that diversity. Along with memorable flavor, these breads are chosen for their unique ingredients, iconic status and the sheer, homey pleasure of eating them.From the rich layers of Malaysian roti canai to Turkey’s seed-crusted simit, they’re a journey through the essence of global comfort food – and a reminder that creativity, like bread, is a human inheritance.In alphabetical order by location, here are 50 of the world’s most wonderful breads.Golden blisters of crisp dough speckle a perfectly made bolani, but the real treasure of Afghanistan’s favorite flatbread is hidden inside.After rolling out the yeast-leavened dough into a thin sheet, Afghan bakers layer bolani with a generous filling of potatoes, spinach or lentils. Fresh herbs and scallions add bright flavor to the chewy, comforting dish, which gets a crispy crust when it’s fried in shimmering-hot oil.When your Armenian mother-in-law comes towards you wielding a hula hoop-sized flatbread, don’t duck: Lavash is draped over the country’s newlyweds to ensure a life of abundance and prosperity.Maybe that’s because making lavash takes friends.To shape the traditional breads, groups of women gather to roll and stretch dough across a cushion padded with hay or wool. It takes a practiced hand to slap the enormous sheets onto the inside of conical clay ovens, where they bake quickly in the intense heat.The bread is so central to Armenia’s culture it’s been designated UNESCO Intangible Heritage.A traveler’s staple suited to life on the road, damper recalls Australia’s frontier days.It’s a simple blend of water, flour and salt that can be cooked directly in the ashes, pressed into a cast iron pan or even toasted at the end of a stick. These days, recipes often include some chemical leavening, butter and milk, turning the hearty backwoods fare into a more refined treat similar to Irish soda bread.A dunk in hot oil turns soft wheat dough into a blistered, golden flatbread that’s a perfect pairing with the country’s aromatic curries.It’s a popular choice for breakfast in Bangladesh, often served with white potato curry, but you can find the puffy breads everywhere from Dhaka sidewalk stalls to home kitchens.It’s a triumph of kitchen ingenuity that South America’s native cassava is eaten at all: The starchy root has enough naturally occurring cyanide to kill a human being.But by carefully treating cassava with a cycle of soaking, pressing and drying, many of the continent’s indigenous groups found a way to turn the root into an unlikely culinary star. Now, it’s the base for one of Brazil’s most snackable treats, a cheesy bread roll whose crisp crust gives way to a tender, lightly sour interior.The fire is always lit at Montreal’s Fairmount Bagel, which became the city’s first bagel bakery when it opened in 1919 under the name Montreal Bagel Bakery.Inside, bakers use long, slender wooden paddles to slide rows of bagels into the wood-fired oven, where they toast to a deep golden color.New Yorkers might think they have a monopoly on bagels, but the Montreal version is an entirely different delicacy.Here, bagel dough is mixed with egg and honey, and the hand-shaped rings are boiled in honey water before baking. The result is dense, chewy and lightly sweet, and you can buy them hot from the oven 24 hours a day.An influx of European immigrants brought their wheat-bread traditions to Chile in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the country’s favorite snack has descended from that cultural collision.Split into four lobes, the marraqueta has a pale, fluffy interior, but the ubiquitous roll is all about the crust. Bakers slide a pan of water into the oven to achieve an addictively crispy exterior that is a favorite part of the marraqueta for many Chileans.It’s a nourishing part of daily life, to the extent that when a Chilean wants to describe a child born to a life of plenty, they might say “nació con la marraqueta bajo el brazo,” or “they were born with a marraqueta under their arm.”Crack into the sesame-seed crust of a shaobing to reveal tender layers that are rich with wheat flavor.Expert shaobing bakers whirl and slap the dough so thin that the finished product has 18 or more layers. The north Chinese flatbread can then be spiked with sweet or savory fillings, from black sesame paste to smoked meat or Sichuan pepper.Melted lard lends a hint of savory flavor to loaves of pan Cubano, whose fluffy crumb offers a tender contrast to the crisp, cracker-like crust.Duck into a Cuban bakery, and you’ll likely spot the long, golden loaf with a pale seam down the center: Some bakers press a stripped palmetto leaf into the dough before baking to create a distinctive crack along the length of the bread.It’s popular from Havana to Miami, but it’s only stateside that you’ll find the loaves in “Cuban sandwiches,” which are thought to have been invented during the 19th century by Cubans living in Florida.Bedouin tribes travel light in Egypt’s vast deserts, carrying sacks of wheat flour to make each day’s bread in the campfire.While some Bedouin breads are baked on hot metal sheets, libba is slapped directly into the embers. That powerful heat sears a crisp, browned crust onto the soft dough, leaving the inside steaming and moist.Walk the streets of San Salvador, and you’ll never be far from the toasted-corn scent of cooking pupusas.The griddled corn bread is both a beloved snack and a national icon.To make pupusas, a cook wraps a filling of cheese, pork or spiced beans into tender corn dough, then pats the mixture onto a blazing-hot griddle. A bright topping of slaw-like curtido cuts through the fat and salt for a satisfying meal.It’s a flavor that’s endured through the centuries. At the UNESCO-listed site of Joya de Cerén, a Maya city buried by an erupting volcano, archaeologists have found cooking tools like those used to make pupusas that date to around 600 A.D.A constellation of bubbles pocks injera’s spongy surface, making this Ethiopian bread the perfect foil for the country’s rich sauces and stews.Also beloved in neighboring Eritrea and Somalia, injera is both a mealtime staple and the ultimate utensil – tear off tender pieces of moist, rolled-up bread to scoop food served on a communal platter.Made from an ancient – and ultra-nutritious – grain called teff, injera has a characteristically sour taste. It’s the result of a fermentation process that starts by blending fresh batter with cultures from a previous batch, then leaving the mixture to grow more flavorful over several days.The French may frown on eating on the go, but there’s an unofficial exception for “le quignon,” the crisp-baked end of a slender baguette.You’re allowed to break that off and munch it as you walk down the street – perhaps because the baguette has pride of place as a symbol of French culture.But like some of the greatest traditions, the baguette is a relatively recent invention.According to Paris food historian Jim Chevallier, long, narrow breads similar to modern baguettes gained prominence in the 19th century, and the first official mention is in a 1920 price list. (French President Emmanuel Macron nonetheless argues that the baguette deserves UNESCO status.)Bubbling with fresh imeruli and sulguni cheeses, khachapuri might be the country of Georgia’s most beloved snack.The savory flatbread starts with soft, yeasted dough that’s pinched into a boat-shaped cradle, then baked with a generous filling of egg and cheese. An elongated shape maximizes the contrast in texture, from the tender interior to crisp, brown tips. Khachapuri experts know to break off the ends for swabbing in the rich, oozing filling.It’s such a key feature of Georgian cuisine that the Khachapuri Index is one measure of the country’s economic welfare; and in 2019, the country’s National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation named traditional khachapuri as UNESCO Intangible Heritage of Georgia.Pure rye flour lends these iconic north German loaves impressive heft, along with a distinctive, mahogany hue.The most traditional versions are baked in a warm, steamy oven for up to 24 hours. It’s an unusual technique that helps transform sugars in the rye flour, turning naturally occurring sweetness into depth of flavor.Pumpernickel has been a specialty in Germany’s Westphalia region for hundreds of years, and there’s even a family-owned bakery in the town of Soest that’s made the hearty bread using the same recipe since 1570.Hong Kong bakers outdo each other by crafting the softest, fluffiest breads imaginable, turning wheat flour into pillowy confections.Pai bao might be loftier than all the rest, thanks to a technique known as the Tangzhong method.When mixing the wheat dough, bakers add a small amount of cooked flour and water to the rest of the ingredients, a minor change with major impact on the bread’s structural development. The results? A wonderfully tender loaf that retains moisture for days, with a milky flavor that invites snacking out of hand.The simmering, geothermal heat that powers Iceland’s geysers, hot springs and steam vents also provides a natural oven for this slow-baked Icelandic rye bread.Made with dark rye flour, the dough is enclosed in a metal pot before it’s buried in the warm ground near geothermal springs and other hotspots. When baked in the traditional method, dökkt rúgbrauð takes a full 24 hours to cook in the subterranean “oven.”It’s an ingenious use of an explosive natural resource, and in the hot-springs town of Laugarvatn, visitors can try loaves of dökkt rúgbrauð when it’s fresh from a hole in the black sand.Flatbreads go wonderfully flaky in this whole-wheat Indian treat, which can be eaten plain or studded with savory fillings.Folding and rolling the dough over thinly spread fat creates sumptuous layers that are rich with flavor, employing a technique similar to that used for croissants or puff pastry.Stuffed wheat bread has been made in India for hundreds of years, and several varieties even get a shout-out in the “Manasollasa,” a 12th-century Sanskrit text that contains some of the earliest written descriptions of the region’s food.Palm sugar and cinnamon lend a light, aromatic sweetness to roti gambang, a tender wheat bread that’s an old-fashioned favorite at Jakarta bakeries.The name evokes the gambang, a traditional Indonesian instrument with a resemblance to the slender, brown loaves.For the recipe, though, cooks look back to the colonial era: From spiced holiday cookies to cheese sticks topped with Gouda or Edam, Indonesian baking has adapted Dutch ingredients and techniques to local tastes.It takes a pair of deft bakers to craft this addictive Iranian flatbread, which is cooked directly on a bed of hot pebbles.That blazing-hot surface pocks the wheat dough with golden blisters, and it gives sangak – also known as nan-e sangak – a characteristic chewiness.If you’re lucky enough to taste sangak hot from the oven, enjoy a heavenly contrast of crisp crust and tender crumb. Eat the flatbread on its own, or turn it into an Iranian-style breakfast: Use a piece of sangak to wrap salty cheese and a bundle of aromatic green herbs.You don’t need yeast to get lofty bread: Chemical leavening can add air through an explosive combination of acidic and basic ingredients. While Native Americans used refined potash to leaven griddled breads – an early example of chemical leavening – this version became popular during the lean years of the Irish Potato Famine.With potato crops failing, impoverished Irish people started mixing loaves using soft wheat flour, sour milk and baking soda.Now, dense loaves of soda bread are a nostalgic treat that’s a perfect pairing with salted Irish butter.If you think challah is limited to pillowy, braided loaves, think again – traditionally, challah is any bread used in Jewish ritual.And Jewish bakers have long made breads as diverse as the diaspora itself: Think blistered flatbreads, hearty European loaves and Hungarian confections dotted with poppy seeds.Israel’s modern-day bakers draw on that rich heritage. But on Friday afternoons in Tel Aviv, you’ll still spot plenty of the classic Ashkenazi versions that many people in the United States know as challah.Those golden loaves are tender with eggs, and shiny under a generous glaze. It’s the braid, though, that catches the eye. By wrapping dough strands together, bakers create 12 distinctive mounds said to represent 12 loaves in the ancient Temple of Jerusalem.Between an emphasis on “ancient grains” and centuries of floury traditions, it can seem like breadmaking is stuck in the past.But bread is continually evolving, and there’s no better example than this iconic Italian loaf, which was only invented in the 1980s.In 1982, Italian baker Arnaldo Cavallari created the low, chewy loaf in defiance of the baguette-style breads he saw taking over Roman bakeries.It was a watershed moment in the comeback of artisanal breads, which has roots in the 1960s and 1970s backlash against the increasingly industrialized food system.Pan-fried cassava cakes are delicious comfort food in Jamaica, where rounds of bammy bread are a hearty pairing for the island’s ultra-fresh seafood.The traditional process for making bammy bread starts with processing grated cassava to get rid of naturally occurring cyanide; next, sifted cassava pulp is pressed into metal rings.It’s a recipe with ancient roots – cassava has been a staple in South America and the Caribbean since long before the arrival of Europeans here, and it’s believed that the native Arawak people used the root to make flatbreads as well.Yeasted wheat dough makes a convenient package for Japanese curry, turning a sit-down meal into a snack that can be eaten out of hand.Kare pan, or curry bread, is rolled in panko before a dunk in the deep fryer, ensuring a crispy crust that provides maximum textural contrast with the soft, saucy interior.Kare pan is so beloved that there’s even a crime-fighting superhero named for the savory treat: A star of the anime series “Soreike! Anpanman,” Karepanman fights villains by shooting out a burning-hot curry filling.Follow the aroma of baking bread in Amman, and you’ll find bakers in roadside stalls stacking this classic flatbread into steaming piles.When shaping taboon, bakers press rounds of soft, wheat dough over a convex form, then slap them onto the interior of a conical clay oven.What emerges is a chewy round that’s crackling with steam, wafting a rich smell of grain and smoke. It’s the ideal foil for a plate of Jordanian mouttabal, a roasted eggplant dip that’s blended with ground sesame seeds and yogurt.Roti flatbread may have arrived in Malaysia with Indian immigrants, but the country’s made the flaky, rich bread their own.When cooked on a hot griddle, roti canai puffs into a stack of overlapping layers rich with buttery flavor. Irresistible when served with Malaysian dips and curries, roti canai becomes a meal all its own with the addition of stuffings from sweet, ripe bananas to fried eggs.The tawny crust of Malta’s sourdough gives way to a pillow-soft interior, ideal for rubbing with a fresh tomato or soaking up the islands’ prized olive oils.Classic versions take more than a day to prepare, and were traditionally baked in shared, wood-fired ovens that served as community gathering places.Even now that few Maltese bake their own bread, Ħobż tal-Malti has a powerful symbolism for the Mediterranean island nation.When trying to discover someone’s true nature, a Maltese person might ask “x’ħobz jiekol dan?,” literally, “what kind of bread does he eat?”Thin rounds of corn dough turn blistered and brown on a hot comal, the traditional griddles that have been used in Mexico since at least 700 BCE.Whether folded into a taco or eaten out of hand, corn tortillas are one of the country’s most universally loved foods. The ground-corn dough is deceptively simple; made from just a few ingredients, it’s nonetheless a triumph of culinary ingenuity.Before being ground, the corn is mixed with an alkaline ingredient such as lime, a process called nixtamalization that makes the grain more nutritious and easier to digest.Follow the rich scent of baking bread through a Moroccan medina, and you may find yourself at one of the communal neighborhood ovens called ferran. This is where locals bring rounds of tender wheat dough ready to bake into khobz kesra, one of the country’s homiest breads.The low, rounded loaves have a slightly crisp exterior that earns them pride of place on the Moroccan table, where their fluffy texture is ideal for absorbing aromatic tajine sauce.Golden, crisp rounds of fry bread are a taste of home for many in the Navajo Nation, as well as a reminder of a tragic history.When Navajo people were forced out of their Arizona lands by the US government in 1864, they resettled in New Mexican landscapes where growing traditional crops of beans and vegetables proved difficult.To survive, they used government-provided stores of white flour, lard and sugar, creating fry bread out of stark necessity.Now, fry bread is a symbol of perseverance and tradition, and a favorite treat everywhere from powwows to family gatherings.Putting the “Dutch” in Dutch crunch, tijgerbrood is a crust-lover’s masterpiece in every crispy bite.To create the mottled top of tijgerbrood, bakers spread unbaked loaves of white bread with a soft mixture of rice flour, sesame oil, water and yeast.Heat transforms the exterior into a crispy pattern of snackable pieces, and loaves of tijgerbrood are beloved for sandwiches. (An ocean away from Amsterdam’s Old World bakeries, San Francisco has made Dutch crunch its sandwich bread of choice as well.)When European settlers brought potatoes and wheat to New Zealand, indigenous Maori people made the imported ingredients their own with this innovative bread.To mix the dough, potatoes are boiled then fermented into a sourdough-like starter that gives the finished bread a sweet-and-sour taste.Now, rēwena parāoa is a favorite treat when layered with butter and jam or served with a hearty portion of raw fish, a longtime delicacy for Maori people.If you don’t think of northern Europe as flatbread country, you haven’t tasted lefse.The Norwegian potato flatbread is a favorite at holidays, when there are many hands to roll the soft dough with a grooved pin, then cook it on a hot griddle. For a taste of Norwegian comfort food, eat a warm lefse spiraled with butter, sugar and a dash of cinnamon.While potatoes are just an 18th-century addition to the Norwegian diet, Scandinavian flatbread is at least as old as the Vikings.Slather a hot round of podplomyk with white cheese and fruit preserves for a taste of old-fashioned, Polish home cooking.The unyeasted flatbread is blistered brown. With ingredients limited to wheat flour, salt and water, podplomyk is a deliciously simple entry in the sprawling family tree of flatbreads.Since dough for podplomyk is rolled thin, it was traditionally baked before other loaves are ready for the oven. In the Middle Ages, the portable breads were shared with neighbors and household members as a sign of friendship. (Today, that tradition is carried on with the exchange of oplatek wafers at Christmastime.)Corn and buckwheat are stone-milled, sifted and kneaded in a wooden trough for the most traditional version of this hearty peasant bread from northern Portugal.When the loaves are baked in wood-fired, stone ovens, an archipelago of floury crust shards expands over deep cracks. The ovens themselves are sealed with bread dough, which acts as a natural oven timer: The bread is ready when the dough strips turn toasty brown.Europeans didn’t taste corn until they arrived in the Americas, but it would be eagerly adopted in northern Portuguese regions where soil conditions are poorly suited to growing wheat.Bread baking becomes art on Russian holidays, when golden loaves of karavai are decked in dough flowers, animals and swirls.The bread plays a starring role at weddings, with elaborate rules to govern the baking process: Traditionally, a happily married woman must mix the dough, and a married man slides the round loaf into the oven.Even the round shape has an ancient symbolism and is thought to date back to ancient sun worship. Now, it’s baked to ensure health and prosperity for a new couple.Once part of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, this mountainous island’s cuisine remains distinct from mainland Italy. Among the most iconic foods here is pane carasau, parchment-thin flatbread with a melodic nickname: carta de musica, or sheet music.While pane carasau starts like a classic flatbread, there’s a Sardinian twist that makes it an ideal traveling companion; after the flatbreads puff up in the oven, they’re sliced horizontally into two thinner pieces. Those pieces are baked a second time, drying out the bread enough to last for months.Warm squares of Serbian proja, or cornbread, are a favorite accompaniment to the country’s lush meat stews.It’s a homey dish that’s often cooked fresh for family meals, then served hot from the oven. Ground corn offers a lightly sweet foil to salty toppings, from salty kajmak cheese to a scattering of cracklings.There’s buried treasure within every loaf of gyeran-ppang, individually sized wheat breads with a whole egg baked inside.Translating simply to “egg bread,” gyeran-ppang is a favorite in the streets of Seoul, eaten hot for breakfast – or at any other time of day.The addition of ham, cheese and chopped parsley adds a savory twist to the sweet-and-salty treat, a belly-warming snack that keeps South Korea fueled through the country’s long winters.A thin, fermented batter of rice flour and coconut milk turns crisp in the bowl-shaped pans used for cooking appam, one of Sri Lanka’s most ubiquitous treats.Often called hoppers, this whisper-thin pancake is best eaten hot – preferably while standing around a Colombo street food stall.Favorite toppings for appam in Sri Lanka include coconut sambal and chicken curry, or you can order one with egg. For egg hoppers, a whole egg is cracked into the center of an appam, then topped with a richly aromatic chili paste. Appam is also popular in southern India.Overnight fermentation lends a delicious tang to this Sudanese flatbread, balancing the mild, earthy flavor of sorghum flour with a tart bite.Making the crepe-like kisra takes practice and patience, but perfect the art of cooking these on a flat metal pan and you’ll be in for a classic Sudanese treat.Like Ethiopian injera, kisra is both staple food and an edible utensil – use pieces of the spongy bread to scoop up spicy bites of the hearty stews that are some of Sudan’s most beloved foods.Before commercial yeast was available, brewers and bakers worked in tandem: Brewers harvested yeast from their batches of beer, passing it off to bakers whose bread would be infused with a light beer flavor.That legacy lives on in Sweden’s vörtlimpa: Limpa means loaf, while vört refers to a tart dose of brewer’s wort. Known as limpa bread in English, the light rye now gets acidity from orange juice, not brewers wort.Crops of cold-hardy barley have thrived on the Tibetan Plateau for thousands of years, and the grain has long been a staple of high-altitude diets there.While balep korkun is often made with wheat, traditional versions of this flatbread are shaped from tsampa, a roasted barley flour with nutty flavor.That rich-tasting flour is so central to Tibetan identity that it’s been turned into a hashtag and been called out in rap songs. (The Dalai Lama even eats it for breakfast.)Dredged in sesame seeds and spiraled into rings, simit might be Turkey’s ultimate on-the-go treat.A few decades ago, vendors wound through the Istanbul streets carrying trays piled high with the breads, but roving bread-sellers are now rare in the capital.Instead, commuters pick up their daily simit at roadside stands, where the deep-colored rings are stacked by the dozen. A burnished crust infuses the breads with a light sweetness – before sliding into wood fired ovens, simit is dunked in sugar-water or thinned molasses, a slick glaze that turns to caramel in the intense heat.Yeasted wheat batter bubbles into a spongy cake for this griddled treat, a British favorite when smeared with jam, butter or clotted cream.Ring molds contain the pourable batter on an oiled griddle, which cooks one side of each crumpet to a golden hue. Like Eastern European zwieback and crisp rusks, crumpets are mostly eaten as a twice-baked bread – the rounds are split and toasted before serving.Smeared with butter or dripping in gravy, biscuits are one of the United States’ homiest tastes. That’s not to say they’re easy to make: Achieving soft, fluffy biscuits requires quick hands and gentle mixing.In the antebellum South, biscuits were seen as a special treat for Sunday dinner. These days they’re nearly ubiquitous, from gas station barbecue joints to home-cooked meals.Part of the secret is in the flour, typically a low-protein flour like White Lily. The soft wheat used for White Lily was long grown in Southern states – before long-distance food shipping. (It’s now milled in the Midwest.)Flatbreads become art in Uzbekistan’s traditional tandoor ovens, which turn out rounds adorned with twists, swirls and stamps.Uzbek non varies across regions, from Tashkent’s chewy versions to Samarkand loaves showered in black nigella seeds. As soon as the breads emerge from the oven, they’re turned over to a swarm of bicycle messengers who ferry the hot loaves to markets and cafes.Areperos – Venezuelan arepa-makers – pat golden rounds of corn dough onto hot griddles to give the plump flatbreads a deliciously toasted crust and tender, steaming interior.Arepas have been made in Venezuela and surrounding regions since long before the arrival of Europeans in South America, and the nourishing corn breads can range from simple to elaborate.At breakfast, try them split and buttered. Stuffed with savory fillings, creamy sauces and fiery salsa, arepas can become a hearty meal all their own.A family tree of flatbreads stretches across the Middle East and beyond, but Yemen’s Jewish community’s version is a richer treat than most.To make malawach, bakers roll wheat dough into a delicate sheet and fold it over a slick of melted butter. The dough is twisted into a loose topknot, then re-rolled, sending veins of butter through overlapping layers.When the pan-fried dough emerges steaming from the stovetop, a final shower of black nigella or sesame seeds add texture and savory crunch."

        "title": "How to survive a cobra bite – or better yet, avoid one entirely",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Thailand is full of snakes – more than 200 species, including cobras. That might be unsettling for some people, but it was ideal for Prangmart Charoenwai as a boy in southern Thailand.He was intrigued by the reptiles. He once captured a nonvenomous sunbeam snake, letting it go days later when he couldn’t feed it properly. He watched online videos to learn techniques in grabbing them, he told CNN.He saw his first cobra when he was about 15 or 16.“It was quite big,” Prangmart, now 39, said. “I later saw that snake spread its hood. I stood there watching its behavior. It threatened me, but I felt it was not scary. … I thought it was beautiful.”His fascination and confidence grew, but his good fortune with cobras didn’t last.In April 2021, the market owner went out on a mission in Trang province in southern Thailand with his rescue group, which responds to routine emergency response tasks, including snake-catching.Residents in the area said they were concerned about some king cobras. Prangmart arrived at the site with about 15 team members.They didn’t find any cobras the first day, but that changed the next day after some thick brush and overgrown vines were cleared out.“I saw a hole in a big rock where I spotted a snake’s tail, and it looked like it was going into that hole,” Prangmart recalled. “I ran there quickly, and then used a hook to try to get it out.”But the snake eluded the device.“Due to my carelessness, because I have been working in this area for too long, I decided to use my bare hand to snatch the cobra’s tail out.”That impulsive grab turned out to be a major miscalculation.Cobras have an extensive range – from much of Africa into the Middle East, then into India and the rest of South Asia. From there, they continue into Southeast Asia and Indonesia. That puts them in potential contact with billions of people.They belong to the elapid family of snakes, which has roughly 300 venomous species. Coral snakes, sea snakes, mambas and kraits are also in this group.There are about 30 cobra species, according to expert Rom Whitaker, who helped start the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust in India. (Its spinoff, the Irula Snake-catchers Industrial Cooperative Society, supplies the venom used to produce life-saving antivenom to India).Whitaker said he uses an approximation of the number of species because cobra taxonomy often changes as experts learn more about the snakes. Africa accounts for roughly two-thirds of the species.Generally, cobras deliver a neurotoxin, which interferes with nerve impulses and can cause paralysis of the heart and lungs. That’s different from that of many vipers, such as rattlesnakes. They generally have a hemotoxin that attacks the blood vessels and causes bleeding and tissue damage.But Nick Brandehoff, who practices emergency medicine and medical toxicology in Colorado and California, said he and other experts are learning that snake venom is more complicated than that simple breakdown. Some elapids have hemotoxic properties, and some vipers have neurotoxic properties. It can vary from snake to snake.Either way, venomous snakebites are a serious problem in many tropical regions. Only an average of five people die a year of venomous snakebites in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But the World Health Organization estimates around 81,000 to 138,000 people die each year worldwide from snakebites, while about three times that many people live with permanent disabilities.Despite the high number of deaths and envenomings (bites in which venom is delivered into the body), don’t assume cobras are aggressive.“Cobras are shy snakes, and though they make a dramatic show when cornered and alarmed, rearing up, spreading a hood, and hissing loudly, this is stark fear, not aggression,” said Whitaker. “The snake only wants to be left alone.”Brandehoff, who helps run the Asclepius Snakebite Foundation, added that “they’re typical of most other snakes in that they don’t want human contact.” And he emphasized cobras don’t chase people.Kim Gray, curator of herpetology and ichthyology with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, cited another reason cobras don’t like to bite people.“Venom is valuable to the snake, and it is used to immobilize prey and begin the digestion process, which the snake needs because it eats whole food items and has no limbs to help it in this process,” Gray said.“So it does not want to waste its venom by recklessly biting and envenoming all the humans it can encounter.”Biting is a last resort if its typical warning signs to back off don’t work, she said.The vast majority of cobra bites happen to agricultural workers in fields and other locals, often low-income people living in easy-to-enter dwellings and who sleep on the floor, Brandehoff said.“Though people have an idea that the ‘jungle is full of snakes,’ that’s really not true,” Whitaker added. “Cobras are most common in agricultural areas thanks to the proliferation of their favorite prey: rats and mice.“Alert snakes like cobras are frightened of humans and usually flee or freeze when a human approaches. The odds of encountering a cobra on the usual tourist routes in India or Thailand are very slim.”People staying in hotels with full facilities in a city have less to worry about than those in rural, rustic facilities, Gray said.If you do find yourself bedding down in a place more likely to attract cobras, she suggested:• Keep debris away from the shelter• Clean up food and grains that might attract rats• Try to keep furniture higher up off the floor and sleep in an elevated bed.Whitaker said it is essential to shine a flashlight when walking at night and not put your hands in thick, bushy spots.The experts are unanimous: Leave the snake alone.“Move deliberately and calmly away from the snake – while keeping an eye on its location if possible,” Gray said. “Move to an open area free of brush and rock outcrops if possible” if you’re outdoors.“Do not try to restrain it, capture it or kill it with a broom or shovel or anything,” she emphasized.Brandehoff concurred. “Give it its space. You are a large mammalian predator to them. They do not want to engage you.”Whitaker said that bites “usually don’t happen from the strike of a cobra in the hooded posture but … happen when the snake is stressed by being stepped upon or mistakenly grabbed.”What should you do if you chance on a cobra that’s already really close and seems ready to strike?“Move quickly away,” Gray said. “Human reaction time is so slow compared to their strike so there may not be much you can do – but typically the trajectory of the cobra’s bite is forward and downward, and they are not able to change direction mid-strike, so perhaps a sideways rapid move away from the snake may be beneficial.”Prangmart Charoenwai’s impulsive maneuver to grab an escaping cobra cost him.“The hole was not deep; the snake made a U-turn out quicker than I thought.”That’s when it happened. Prangmart got bit on his left thumb. Then he got bit on his right hand.Despite the strikes, Prangmart was determined to capture and bag the cobra himself since he was already bitten – even though his left hand was already getting numb.“I was told to step aside; I refused. Instead, they told me to stay chilled and urged me to quickly go to the hospital and treat my wound.”They finally bagged the cobra, and Prangmart was able to walk to an ambulance. But his trouble had just started – the hospital was two hours away.As Prangmart was learning the hard way, cobra bites are very serious business. But they are by no means a death sentence.“Most snakebites, even cobra bites, are not fatal.” Whitaker said. “But any snakebite must be treated as a medical emergency.“The single most important thing to do is to get to a hospital without any delay. Do not resort to any local or home remedy because there is only one cure for a snakebite and that is antivenom.”Gray said that you should try to stay calm and “immobilize the limb that was bitten, get to the closest hospital without delay (and) make a note of where the bite occurred and the time the bite occurred.”Also, get a description or photo of the snake if it can be taken safely. This can help doctors with treatment, she said.Do not tie a tourniquet or try the old “cut and suction” method, Whitaker said, nor should you use a so-called “snakebite kit.”Brandehoff said that if the bite comes from a cobra with strictly neurotoxic venom, people may recommend a crepe wrap, which can help reduce the spread of the venom from a limb to the rest of the body via compression.“The problem with that is most people don’t know what kind of snake bit them” and that it’s not reasonable to expect people to readily ID various cobra species.And if the venom has hemotoxic properties, a wrap can cause more harm than good, damaging tissue around the bite area, he said.Rings and other jewelry should be removed.“The earlier antivenom can be administered, the better your chances of not having long-term disability or potentially dying,” he said.Spitting cobras can cause “venom ophthalmoplegia,” which is basically burning of the eyes, Brandehoff said. Permanent damage can occur but is rarer.The main treatment is washing the eyes “copiously,” he said.Prangmart’s arrival at the hospital in Thailand did not end his emergency. “After I received the serum, I had an allergic reaction,” he said.“I started to have short breaths, rashes. The doctor had to rush back and treated me again. I was watched regularly during that time.”Was he afraid he would die?“The severe conditions I had to endure at the hospital lasted about two hours. It was when I thought I may not make it. My heart rate was racing, too.”Prangmart pulled through the immediate crisis but then embarked on a 15-day ordeal, bouncing between Western medical doctors and practitioners of Thai traditional medicine to try to save his left hand, where repeated infections threatened to spread.He eventually got better, but he’s left with a big scar, an important reminder for him and the rest of his team.“At that time when I saw the snake, I felt excited and I didn’t want it to escape into the hole. Because of that excitement, I hurriedly grabbed the snake. What happened to me, it was my own carelessness.”And if someone else should encounter a cobra?“Keep calm and watch it; don’t hurry, turn your back and run. … If you are very scared, start to retreat backward step by step,” he said. “Generally, these snakes are not likely to attack people first unless there is clear threat to them.”Cobras keep the environment in balance.“Without cobras, the rodent problem in agricultural areas could lead to famine,” Whitaker said. “These are the most efficient rodent predators in existence, able to enter rat burrows and clean out the entire family.”But he said antivenom efforts must continue.“Those of us who appreciate and respect snakes need to support programs to help reduce the tremendous burden of snakebites affecting tens of millions of rural people in Africa, Asia and South America,” Whitaker said.Brandehoff agreed: “We can’t attempt to eradicate snakebites like we can malaria. The best thing we can do is try to mitigate snakebites by trying to minimize contacts.”We need to “learn to live with them. … In a lot of cultures, there’s a lot of fear of snakes. See a snake, kill a snake; it’s not helpful.”"

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "A man trying to swim to shore after his recreational sailboat capsized at Everglades National Park suffered an apparent bite from an American crocodile, according to a National Park Service news release.Rangers responded around 4:43 p.m. Sunday to a report that the man was observed going under water at Flamingo Marina, located in southern part of the park near the open water of the Florida Straits.They were able to pull a 68-year-man out and treat a laceration on one of his legs, the release said.The rangers worked with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue to transport the patient to a hospital, and the patient was reported stable upon transfer to EMS providers, the release said.“Rangers and park biologists are continuing to investigate the incident and monitor the suspected crocodile, which is easily identifiable,” the release said.The American crocodile is a federally threatened species, the NPS said, and it resembles the American alligator. But they are different species in very different situations.There are only about 2,000 adult crocodiles in the mainland United States, living exclusively in a narrow range along the coastlines of central and southern Florida, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. (American crocodiles can also be found in some coastal areas of Caribbean islands, Mexico and South America.)Meanwhile, an estimated 5 million wild American alligators are spread out across 10 states in Southeast and beyond, including parts of North Carolina and even the extreme southeastern tip of Oklahoma.American crocodiles are considered a shy and reclusive species, the FFWCC says, and crocodile attacks on humans in Florida are very rare.Worldwide is a different matter – about 1,000 deaths a year are attributed to crocodile attacks in places such as Africa, mainland Asia, Indonesia and Australia."

        "title": "World’s best spicy foods: 20 dishes to try",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Some like it hot – and some like it hotter, still.When it comes to the world’s best spicy dishes, we have some of the world’s hottest peppers to thank, along with incredible layers of flavor and a long, spice-loving human history.“Spicy food, or at least spiced foods, clearly predates the idea of countries and their cuisine by a very, very long time,” says Indian author Saurav Dutt, who is writing a book about the spiciest foods on the Indian subcontinent.“Every spicy ingredient has a wild ancestor,” he says. “Ginger, horseradish, mustard, chiles and so on have predecessors which led to their domestication.”Hunter-gatherer groups historically made use of various wild ingredients to flavor their foods, Dutt says, and there are many ingredients all over the world that can lend a spicy taste to a dish or stand on their own.Peppers – a headliner for heat – are rated on the Scoville Heat Units scale, which measures capsaicin and other active components of chile peppers. By that measure, the Carolina Reaper is among the hottest in the world, while habaneros, Scotch bonnets and bird’s eye chiles drop down a few rungs on the mop-your-brow scale.Redolent with ghost peppers, Scotch bonnets, serranos, chiltepin peppers, mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns and more, the following spicy dishes from around the world bring the heat in the most delicious way.Ata rodo – Scotch bonnet pepper – brings the fire to Nigeria’s famous spicy soup. Egusi is made by pounding the seeds from the egusi melon, an indigenous West African fruit that’s related to the watermelon.In addition to being protein-packed, the melon’s seeds serve to thicken and add texture and flavor to the soup’s mix of meat, seafood and leafy vegetables. Pounded yams are often served alongside this dish, helping to temper the scorch of the Scotch bonnets.“The joy of this dish is not only the delightful warming ingredients of cinnamon, cloves, star anise and, of course, the Sichuan peppercorns, but the fact that you can cook exactly what you like in the bubbling spicy broth,” says British-born Chinese chef Kwoklyn Wan, author of “The Complete Chinese Takeout Cookbook.”Duck, seafood, chicken, pork, lamb and seasonal vegetables are all fair game for tossing into the pot to simmer in a mouth-numbing broth made with Sichuan peppercorns and dried Sichuan peppers for serious kick (the dipping sauce served on the side often has chile paste, too).Also known as Chongqing hot pot, the dish is said to have originated as a popular food among Yangtze River boatmen. It’s enjoyed by those who can handle its heat all over China, not to mention elsewhere around the world.From northeastern Thailand’s spice-loving Isaan province, this fresh and fiery salad is a staple dish at Thai restaurants around the world and is also popular in neighboring Laos.Som tam turns to green (unripe) papaya for its main ingredient, which is usually julienned or shredded for the salad. The papaya is then tossed with long beans or green beans and a mix of flavorful Asian essentials that include tamarind juice, dried shrimp, fish sauce and sugar cane paste, among other ingredients. Thai chiles, also called bird’s eye chiles, give the salad its requisite kick.The Portuguese introduced this spicy dish also known as peri-peri chicken into Angola and Mozambique as far back as the 15th century, when they mixed African chiles with European ingredients (piri-piri means “pepper pepper” in Swahili). And it’s the perky red pepper of the same name that brings the spiciness to this complex, layered and delicious dish.Piri-piri chicken’s poultry cuts are marinated in chiles, olive oil, lemon, garlic and herbs such as basil and oregano for a fiery flavor that blends salty, sour and sweet. The dish is also popular in Namibia and South Africa, where it’s often found on the menu in Portuguese restaurants.The glossy red hues dancing on a plate of this popular pork dish, a version of which hails from Mao Zedong’s home province, give a hint about the mouth experience to come. The dish was apparently a favorite of the communist leader, who requested his chefs in Beijing prepare it for him.Chairman Mao’s braised pork belly – called Mao shi hong shao rou in China – is often served as the main dish for sharing at a family table and is made by braising chunks of pork belly with soy sauce, dried chiles and spices.“It is a very delicious and moreish dish due to the caramelized sugar and dark soy sauce being reduced and all the aromatics (that coat the pork belly),” wrote BBC “Best Home Cook” winner Suzie Lee, author of “Simply Chinese,” in an email to CNN Travel.Jamaica’s favorite pepper is the Scotch bonnet, beloved not just for its spiciness but for its aroma, colors and flavor, too, says Mark Harvey, content creator and podcaster at Two On An Island, who was born in Spanish Town, Jamaica.“For Jamaicans, the degree of spiciness starts at medium for children and goes up to purple hot,” he says, explaining that the peppers come in green, orange, red and purple hues, growing increasingly spicy in that order.Scotch bonnets star in several of the island’s iconic dishes, including escovitch fish, pepper pot soup and curry goat. But you might recognize them most from the ubiquitous jerk chicken and pork smoking roadside everywhere from Montego Bay to Boston Bay, where meat prepared with the peppery marinade is cooked the traditional way, atop coals from pimento tree wood (the tree’s allspice berries are also used in the jerk marinade).Popular on the Indonesian islands of Bali and Lombok, in particular, this whole chicken dish is stuffed with an intensely aromatic spice paste (betutu) that usually includes a mashup of fresh hot chile peppers, galangal (a root related to ginger), candlenuts, shallots, garlic, turmeric and shrimp paste, among other ingredients.The chicken is then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed, bringing the aromatics out all the more and flavoring the chicken to the max. Best shared, ayam betutu is often presented at religious ceremonies in Bali, but you’ll find it at restaurants specializing in it throughout the islands, too.Beer and buffalo chicken wings are as American as, well, hamburgers. And if you’re not eating them alongside a pile of celery sticks and a ramekin of dunking sauce – traditionally blue cheese dip, but ranch works, too – you’re missing half the picture.A sports bar staple at chain restaurants such as Buffalo Wild Wings and more refined outposts, too, from Alaska to Maine, “wings” are actually made up of the wing parts called drumettes and wingettes, which have the most meat.Buffalo wings, said to have been invented in a bar in Buffalo, New York, in 1964, are among the spiciest preparations (other popular variations include teriyaki wings and honey garlic wings). Make them as fiery as you like using a sauce that includes cayenne pepper, butter, vinegar, garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce.Similar to ceviche but with more bite, this raw marinated shrimp dish from the western Mexican state of Sinaloa (and a staple along the Baja Peninsula, too) tastes as good as it looks.Tiny but mighty chiltepín peppers (they look like bright little berries), grown throughout the United States and Mexico, make the spicy magic happen in shrimp aguachiles, which means “pepper water.” If you can’t find those, serrano and jalapeño peppers also do the trick.Marinate the raw shrimp with ingredients including lime juice, cilantro, red onion and cucumber and enjoy with crispy tostadas.A go-to dish when you want something satisfying – but with kick – pad ka prao is a mealtime staple in Thailand, where you’ll find it on offer at street-side stalls and restaurants everywhere from Bangkok to the islands.Considered the Thai equivalent of a sandwich or a burger, the dish is a mix of ground pork, spicy Thai chile peppers and holy basil and can be ordered as spicy as you like. Many locals believe it’s best topped with a fried egg with a runny yolk.A fiery favorite that originated in West Sumatra, versions of beef rendang are also enjoyed in Indonesia’s neighboring countries, including Malaysia and Brunei, as well as the Philippines.This flavorful dry curry dish calls on kaffir lime leaves, coconut milk, star anise and red chile, among other spices, to deliver its complexity. It’s often presented to guests and served during festive events.The fermented cabbage dish kimchi might be the spicy Korean dish that first comes to mind, but when you want some extra kick, dakdoritang does the trick.Comfort food to the max, the chicken stew doubles down on its spiciness with liberal doses of gochugaru (Korean chile powder) and gochujang (Korean chile paste) mixed with rice wine, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and sesame oil in a braising sauce that packs the bone-in chicken pieces with flavor. It’s often served with carrots, onions and potatoes.This tomato-based British-Asian curry invented in Birmingham, England, curry houses by British Bangladeshi restaurateurs is thought to be one of the spiciest curries in the world.“Typically the sauce has a tomato base with ginger, fennel seeds and copious amounts of chile, habanero or Scotch bonnet, peppers,” says Indian author Saurav Dutt.As many as 10 pepper types may find their way into phaal curry, he says, including bird’s eye chiles and the bhut jolokia (also known as the ghost pepper, it’s one of the world’s hottest peppers). Even hotter than vindaloo, this dish will absolutely light your mouth up.This classic Roman pasta dish’s name gives you an idea of what to expect. “Arrabbiata” means “angry” in Italian. And penne all’arrabbiata pairs the relatively plain penne pasta with fiery flavors from the sauce (sugo all’arrabbiata) in which it’s slathered.“The peperoncino (red chile pepper) is what makes this sauce ‘angry’ (arrabbiata) or spicy,” Chris MacLean of Italy-based Open Tuesday Wines said via email.To tame the angry peppers in this garlic and tomato-based dish with a good glass of red wine, MacLean says to pair penne all’arrabbiata with a Cesanese, also from Rome’s Lazio region, with its crisp fruit and light tannins.“A wine that’s heavy in oak or alcohol would turn up the heat (in the dish) in your mouth and render the wine tasteless,” he warns.“There’s a saying in South India that you are lucky to ‘eat like a Chettiar,’ ” says Dutt, referring to the Tamil-speaking community in India’s southern Tamil Nadu state credited with creating this spicy dish.“Like this chicken dish, the traditional Chettinad dishes mostly used locally sourced spices like star anise, pepper, kalpasi (stone flower) and marati mokku (dried flower pods),” he says.The chicken pieces are simmered in a medley of roasted spices and coconut, and it is traditionally served with steamed rice or the thin South Indian pancakes called dosa, fried chapati or naan.The fiery Ethiopian spice blend called berbere – aromatic with chile peppers, basil, cardamom, garlic and ginger – is instrumental to the flavor chorus that’s doro wat, Ethiopia’s much-loved spicy chicken stew.Topped with boiled eggs, the dish almost always finds a place at the table during weddings, religious holidays and other special occasions and family gatherings. If you’re invited to try it in Ethiopia at such an event, consider yourself very lucky indeed.Mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns bring the X-factor to this popular dish from China’s Sichuan province, which mixes chunks of silken tofu with ground meat (pork or beef) and a spicy fermented bean paste called doubanjiang.Mapo tofu’s fiery red color might as well be a warning to the uninitiated – Sichuan cuisine’s defining flavor, málà, has a numbing effect on the mouth called paresthesia that people tend to love or hate.A Portuguese-influenced dish from India’s southwestern state of Goa, vindaloo was not originally meant to be spicy, says Dutt. “It originally contained pork, potatoes (aloo) and vinegar (vin), giving you the name,” he says.But when the dish was exported to curry houses in the United Kingdom that were mostly run by Muslim Bangladeshi chefs, Dutt says, pork was replaced with beef, chicken or lamb and the dish evolved into a spicier hot curry.Ghost pepper flakes and Scotch bonnet peppers are among the peppers giving the dish its scorching taste. But in Goa, you can still find versions of the dish that swing more on the side of milder spices such as cinnamon and cardamom.Senegalese cooks are also big fans of Scotch bonnet peppers, named for their resemblance to the Scottish tam o’ shanter hat. And their spice-giving goodness is deployed liberally in one of the West African country’s favorite dishes, the spicy tomato and peanut or groundnut-based stew called mafé.Usually made with beef, lamb or chicken, the stew is made even heartier with potatoes, carrots and other root vegetables for one filling feed. Mafé is popular in other West African countries, too, including Mali and Gambia, and it can also be prepared without meat.Synonymous with watching the Super Bowl or hunkering down on a cold night, chili is a spicy American staple where you can opt to ratchet up the heat as much as you like.There are basically two pure forms of American chili – with or without beans (usually red kidney beans) – says Chef Julian Gonzalez of Sawmill Market in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In Texas, he explains, chili traditionally doesn’t have beans, which puts the focus on the spices and chiles used to flavor it, and he goes with that approach himself.“Traditionally chili is seasoned with chili powder, cumin and paprika,” Gonzalez says. From there, you can use other ingredients to make your recipe unique. Adding cayenne pepper is one way to turn up the heat.At his restaurant Red & Green, which serves New Mexican cuisine, Gonzalez’s green chile stew, made with pork and no beans, is seasoned with a mix of roasted green New Mexican hatch chiles (half mild and half with heat), onion and garlic powder."

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Concorde, the world’s fastest commercial aircraft, has been making a rare journey – floating down New York’s Hudson River.The British Airways Concorde, one of only 20 of the supersonic aircraft to ever fly, has been en route back to NYC’s Intrepid Museum after being sanded and recoated during several months of restoration.The delta-wing jet, which has been a hallmark of the aviation and maritime museum since 2003, made its way along the river aboard a barge, with an overnight stop in Jersey City, New Jersey.It was due to be unloaded by crane early on Thursday at the river’s Pier 86, with the event streamed live on the museum’s social media.Intrepid says its Concorde holds the world speed record for a passenger aircraft, having reached 1,354 miles per hour – more than twice the speed of sound – flying New York to London in 2 hours, 52 minutes and 59 seconds in 1996.The aircraft, call sign G-BOAD, first took to the skies in 1976 and once flew a service operated jointly by British Airways and Singapore Airlines, uniquely wearing the liveries of both carriers for a time, according to HeritageConcorde.comIt made its last flight in 2003, on its way to Intrepid. The fleet of Concordes was gradually phased out in the wake of an August 2000 incident in which a Concorde crashed shortly after takeoff in Paris, killing all 109 people on board.The last ever flight by a Concorde was made on November 26, 2003. That aircraft, known as Delta Foxtrot, is now housed in Aerospace Bristol, an aviation museum in the west of England.Tours of Intrepid’s Concorde will resume on April 4, the museum says.CNN’s Barry Neild contributed to this story"

        "title": "Tourists have returned to North Korea for the first time since the pandemic. Here’s what they saw",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Lena Bychcova couldn’t really believe it when her North Korean tourist visa came through.Many Russian tourists have found themselves locked out of tourism destinations. But North Korea — as a key Russian ally — offered a rare opportunity to travel.The marketing professional was one of about 100 Russian nationals who were allowed to travel to North Korea this month in what is believed to be the hermit kingdom’s first international tourist trip since the coronavirus pandemic.Tourism in North Korea is tightly controlled. Individual travelers are not permitted into the country, and groups are accompanied by minders. Tourism revenue is used to support the regime of dictator Kim Jong Un.Traveling to the “hermit kingdom” is not without significant risks. American college student Otto Warmbier was detained on a North Korea trip in 2016, allegedly for stealing a propaganda poster. He was returned to the United States 17 months later in a vegetative state and died soon after.Bychcova and the rest of the group arrived in Pyongyang on February 9, traveling via a North Korean-owned Air Koryo plane from Vladivostok.While Bychcova admits she was anxious about the trip, she says that curiosity won out and she couldn’t pass up the chance to see a country that few tourists have the opportunity to explore.Travel blogger Ilya Voskresensky, who also joined the tour, felt similarly tense – he listed his part-time job, selling vintage dishes, as his profession rather than revealing he was a content creator. Despite his misgivings, he admits that one reason to go through with the trip was to discover whether modern-day North Korea would compare to the Soviet Russia his family members told him about.“When you look at North Korea you realize that your grandma and grandpa were living like they do here,” Voskresensky tells CNN. “It’s a teleport into the past. There are absolutely no advertisements in the city. The only thing on display are party slogans, flags and so on.”The four-day trip cost each visitor about $750. The group had Russian-speaking guides and translators with them at all times. The itinerary included a visit to the bronze statues of the late leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on Mansu Hill, the Mangyongdae Children’s Palace, where kids put on a music and dance performance, and three days at Masikryong Ski Resort.The Russians were also given strict rules to follow, especially when it came to taking pictures and videos.“We were asked not to photograph the military or people in uniform in general, not to photograph the construction sites or any of the buildings under construction,” Bychcova explains. “And there were rules about how to take photographs and generally treat portraits or sculptures of leaders. If you have a newspaper or magazine with a picture of the leader, then you cannot fold the newspaper so that the portrait becomes wrinkled.”These newspapers became some of her favorite souvenirs from North Korea. Bychcova says that there wasn’t much to buy, but there were two shops – one in the airport and one in the capital – where she and other tourists could get magnets, dolls, Lego sets and other small gifts.Before the pandemic, the largest source of inbound tourists to North Korea wasn’t Russia – it was China.The Russian ski trippers were the first tourists allowed into the hermit kingdom since the pandemic, a sign of Russia’s increasing popularity in North Korea.With global sanctions and a shrinking pool of allies, Russia and North Korea’s increased interest in one another has raised the alarm among US Intelligence officials.North Korea has supplied Russia with missiles to use against Ukraine.In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin presented a car to his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un. The act was a possible violation of United Nations sanctions imposed against the country for its nuclear weapons program.Both Voskresensky and Bychcova say that their decision to travel wasn’t about politics – they went to North Korea eager to get to know local people and form relationships.After returning, though, Bychcova doesn’t believe such a thing is truly possible in the North Korean system.“About 200 kids – we counted them on stage! – had prepared an hour-long concert especially for us. And there were just 97 of us,” she says.“So there were more people on stage than spectators. We could feel they were trying to create a certain image of what North Korea looks like for us. But some details revealed that it was not entirely true, that there is another life.”While the Russians were able to discuss their trip to North Korea and their thoughts on the Kim regime freely, that same privilege does not apply in their own country.Criticism of Putin, Russia’s policies and the military are criminal offenses in Russia.A prominent ex-KGB official turned pro-military blogger who had been vocal in supporting the war in Ukraine was arrested and charged with “extremist activity” last summer for comments critical of Putin.Just last week, a 33-year-old dual citizen of Russia and the United States was arrested in Yekaterinburg and accused of “providing financial assistance to a foreign state in activities directed against Russia security.” The reason? She reportedly donated $51 to a Ukrainian charity.While both Voskresensky and Bychcova were aware of North Korea’s human rights abuses, they both tell CNN they hoped the trip would be worth it in order to connect with regular North Korean civilians.Now, both say they would consider going to North Korea again someday – but only if the political situation changes.“The main message of my content is that anywhere: no matter what country, no matter what nationality, it is regular people who live there, and you should treat people with love everywhere,” says Voskresensky. “I hope traveling will save the world.”Another Russian ski trip in North Korea is slated for March 2024."

        "title": "He thought the guy he met on vacation was just a fling. He turned out to be the love of his life",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Guillermo Barrantes relationship with Larry Mock was supposed to begin and end in Palm Springs.It was a “casual, brief encounter.” A vacation dalliance that only lasted half a day.“It was just so casual, so easily nothing could have happened from it,” Guillermo tells CNN Travel. “We could have walked away and just had our lives separate. But of course that didn’t happen, because it wasn’t meant to be that way. It was meant to be the way that it was. That it is.”It all started in summer 2013. Guillermo - then in his early 40s - was on vacation in the California resort city of Palm Springs. He was in a phase of life where, he says, he was prioritizing himself, and wasn’t interested in long term romance.“I thrived in being by myself, in traveling by myself, in having dinner by myself – I loved all of that so much,” says Guillermo, who lived in Boston, Massachusetts at the time.“I wanted no commitment, I wanted no emotional entanglement of any kind. I wanted to have fun, get to know myself. And it was in that mode that I met Larry, when I wasn’t really looking.”During the vacation in Palm Springs, Guillermo was staying at a friend’s apartment, and while the friend worked during the day, Guillermo passed his time at a “run-down, no-frills” resort a couple of blocks away.“You could just pay for a day pass, they’d give you a towel, and you could be in the pool and use their bar,” he recalls.One day, as he was walking the palm tree-lined streets to the resort, Guillermo swiped right on a guy on a dating app – Larry Mock, mid-40s, friendly smile. The two men exchanged a few messages back and forth. Larry said he was also on vacation in Palm Springs, staying in the resort Guillermo kept frequenting.They arranged to meet there for a drink by the pool. Guillermo was looking forward to meeting Larry, expecting “some casual fun.”Then, when Guillermo and Larry met, there was “chemistry” right away. Guillermo calls their connection “magnetic.”“My impression of Larry: sexy, handsome and warm,” he recalls.Larry was a Texas-based American Airlines flight attendant who’d booked the vacation to Palm Springs at the last minute. He’d recently broken up with a long-term partner but due to lease and budget reasons the two were still living together – awkwardly – in Dallas, Texas.Larry’s workdays were spent traveling the world. But during his downtime, he struggled to relax in the apartment with his ex, and this sentiment motivated the spontaneous vacation.“I needed to get out of town for the weekend, because we were just butting heads badly at that time,” Larry tells CNN Travel today.Larry searched his airline’s database, looking at destinations he could visit using the last minute, standby flight tickets available for flight attendants.“Palm Springs had seats, so I booked my standby flight, got to Palm Springs, checked into this resort. And that’s where Guillermo came into the picture,” says Larry.Larry was instantly attracted to Guillermo. He thought he was “just the most handsome guy” he’d ever seen.And as they got chatting, and Guillermo kept making Larry laugh, Larry sketched out his first impression to include two more adjectives: “so funny, and so kind.”In passing, as the two flirted over pool-side cocktails, Larry mentioned that he was a flight attendant.Guillermo lit up. In fact, his response was “giddy,” as Larry recalls it.“He started asking me tons of questions about planes, and flight attendants, and the routes and all of that kind of stuff.”“I’m a huge aviation geek,” explains Guillermo. As a kid growing up in Costa Rica, he’d wanted to be a pilot. Instead, he ended up working as an IT consultant. And while he says he was good at that job, liked it well enough and made good money – he still dreamed about working in aviation. Meeting a flight attendant was fascinating.“I was immediately drawn to his career,” says Guillermo.Larry found Guillermo’s enthusiasm for aviation charming, and happily answered his questions.Later that evening, Larry and Guillermo said their goodbyes, with no plans to meet again.“I was glad to meet him,” says Larry. “But I was like, ‘There’s no way I am going to pursue dating somebody that lived in Boston.’ And I still was dealing with what I was dealing with in Dallas.”“We just really enjoyed the time that we had together,” says Guillermo. “But we went our separate ways.”Almost without realizing – and certainly without intending to – Guillermo and Larry stayed in touch.“We kept chatting, we kept texting,” says Guillermo.Then, a few days after meeting Larry, Guillermo got an unexpected phone call from his mother in Costa Rica. He was still in Palm Springs at the time.“She said, ‘I don’t want you to freak out, but I just got diagnosed with breast cancer. I don’t want you to change the trip.’”Guillermo tried to protest, but his mother insisted he should enjoy the rest of his vacation. She reassured him that her sisters and Guillermo’s father were taking care of her, and she’d see Guillermo later in the month – he already had a trip to Costa Rica scheduled for that summer.Not wanting to go against his mother’s wishes, Guillermo stayed put in the desert. He tried to “compartmentalize” the news, but he was really close to his mom, and it was cataclysmic.Later, back home in Boston, Guillermo found himself sharing his mother’s news with Larry, and confiding in him about his fears and worries. He added that his mother lived in Costa Rica, so he’d likely be flying back and forth for the rest of the year.Larry was supportive, empathetic – and he told Guillermo that he should use the discounted flights Larry got through work.Guillermo was taken aback – it was “such a sweet gesture” from someone who was basically a stranger. But then, somehow, Larry already felt much more than that.“Very early on, he and I had just beautiful interactions, and it revealed the kind of person that he was,” he says.And so, rather than dwindling, Larry and Guillermo’s communication increased as the days rolled on.“Within just a few weeks, we just knew – without much discussion, without talking about it – we just knew that there was a very, very strong connection there,” says Guillermo.“We always had something to talk about,” says Larry.Larry was still hesitant about jumping into something new, following the breakdown of his previous relationship. But the messages back and forth with Guillermo became a highlight of his day. And as time passed, he found himself opening up to Guillermo, confiding in him.“After a few months, I was like, ‘Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for my whole life. Someone that I can be my authentic self with,’” says Larry.In September 2013, two months after their Palm Springs meeting, Larry arranged to visit Guillermo in Boston.At Logan Airport, Larry came down the escalator and spotted Guillermo’s face in the crowd. He was beaming, and started running towards Larry.Then, Guillermo “hugged me so hard,” recalls Larry.He remembers thinking, “Oh my god, this is the one.”Then Guillermo and Larry went to Boston’s seaport district together, and found a sundrenched rooftop bar where they sat drinking beers.“We could see the planes approaching Logan, and it was just a sunny and perfect Boston day,” recalls Guillermo. “I remember that, like a picture, sitting by the edge – I remember the beer and I remember the planes.”It was “magical,” says Guillermo, but also slightly “surreal.”The Palm Springs encounter was so brief. He never thought he’d see Larry again. And now here Larry was, sitting opposite him, in Guillermo’s city.From there, Guillermo and Larry started dating cross-country.They took advantage of Larry’s discounted flights. Sometimes Larry traveled to Boston, but usually Guillermo visited Larry in Dallas. Guillermo’s love of flying meant that, for him, the four-hour journey across the country was part of the fun.“I was in heaven,” he says. “Just the fact that I was getting to do something that I have always just loved - which is being on an airplane and going somewhere.”Each Friday, as he packed his bag and headed to the airport, Guillermo would also be struck with “excitement” at the thought of seeing Larry.And during these weekend visits, Guillermo and Larry grew accustomed to each other’s habits, how they moved through their days, how they liked to spend their time. Guillermo got to know Larry’s friends and got to know Dallas as a city. They spoke about their hopes, dreams, ambitions and families.Guillermo says it was obvious that they were “very aligned on the important aspects of life: how we view finances, closeness with families, politically and world views and enjoyment of the small things in life.”Larry supported Guillermo as he cared for his mother through her cancer, and celebrated with him when she recovered.“For us, it was a gradual process of falling in love,” says Guillermo. “But a theme for us in our life together is that everything felt right and natural.”“We can’t pinpoint the moment, but we simply knew very deep in our hearts that we found the life partner.”“That made me so happy,” says Larry.For Guillermo, moving to Dallas two years later, in late 2015, was “just as the easiest decision.”Larry was thrilled. His Dallas-based friendship group had already welcomed Guillermo into the fold, and his parents were happy for him too.“I introduced Guillermo to everybody,” says Larry. “My family’s always been very accepting of me.”Guillermo’s family situation was more complicated. He’s always been very close with his parents and siblings, but for the first two decades of his adult life, he didn’t talk to his family about relationships.“My personal life was not necessarily an open book,” Guillermo says. “Love has never been the question - my parents love me, I love my parents and my sisters, we all get along great. But there was always that invisible barrier, which was: I don’t talk about my personal relationships.”But Guillermo didn’t want to hide Larry from anyone - he felt he owed that to himself, and to Larry.“I wasn’t going to edit myself, I wasn’t going to filter. I just knew deep in my heart that it was my chance to be able to truly be myself,” he says.So Guillermo started peppering his phone calls home with mentions of Larry. He uploaded cute photos of the two of them to social media.“I’m fearless,” he told himself. “Nothing bad can happen here.”Cut to 2018, which was a monumental year for Guillermo and Larry for a couple of reasons. For one, it was the year Guillermo followed in Larry’s footsteps and became a flight attendant.It was a mutual friend who suggested Guillermo should give it a shot, and Larry – who’d spent years listening to Guillermo wax lyrical about airplanes – was wholeheartedly encouraging.Guillermo applied to Larry’s airline, American Airlines, but wasn’t accepted. But then he applied to Delta, and was accepted on the spot.While Guillermo and Larry loved the idea of working together, flying with different airlines also “worked out great,” says Guillermo. For one, there were two different sets of airline benefits to enjoy.And working in the air was everything Guillermo hoped it would be and more.“I was doing my dream job, my childhood dream job,” he says. “I still have to pinch myself that actually, I am a flight attendant.”2018 was also the year Guillermo and Larry got married.Guillermo proposed to Larry on an airplane. The couple were flying back to Dallas after visiting San Francisco, where they’d attended an Adele concert. As they were descending, the Dallas lights glistening out the airplane window, Guillermo suddenly felt the time was right. He turned to Larry and asked him to marry him. Larry smiled, and said yes.“Despite it being impromptu, as an aviation geek, I love that I proposed on a flight,” says Guillermo.The couple started planning their nuptials. Guillermo was excited, but he was unsure what role – if any – his family would play on the wedding day. While Guillermo had mentioned Larry to his parents, they still hadn’t met him. This was partly because Guillermo’s family were in Costa Rica, and partly because Guillermo wasn’t sure how that meeting would play out.“The person that I had the most trouble with was my father – because he was the one that had the hardest time really accepting me,” says Guillermo.As plans for the wedding started to take shape, Guillermo composed a long email to his father.“I said something to the effect of, ‘Hey Dad, I know I really haven’t really talked much about any of my personal life. But I met this person, Larry, who is the love of my life. We are going to get married. Come, don’t come, no problem. But I just need to tell you because this is probably one of the most important days and times of my life.’”Guillermo’s father didn’t attend the wedding. “For those reasons and also because he was towards the end of his life, his mobility was a problem,” Guillermo says.“But my mom, my sisters, my niece and my nephew came, which was far more than I ever imagined or dreamed. That was such a great moment.”Guillermo introduced his mother and sisters to Larry a couple of days before the wedding. They all gathered at a rooftop bar in Dallas, along with Guillermo and Larry’s close friends.When Guillermo’s mother saw Larry for the first time, she enveloped Larry in her arms. The two hit it off right away. Guillermo was overwhelmed with happiness.“For me, to see Larry and mom interact – they just love each other so much,” says Guillermo. “And my sisters just cannot get enough of him – I just sit back, and just enjoy.”Guillermo and Larry’s wedding took place at the Dallas Arboretum, a botanical garden.It was an outdoor wedding, and the couple woke up to the rain pouring and concerned texts from guests worried how the wedding would play out in a downpour.“But then, sure enough, out came the sun at the right time,” recalls Guillermo.Larry and Guillermo wrote their own vows and read them to each other during the ceremony. Guillermo told Larry that he inspired him to be a better son, sibling, friend and person.“You want a partner that is going to challenge you to be better,” says Guillermo. “I always feel that I want to be a better human being just in general, because he is such a figure in my life and everyone’s life – he is the center of everybody’s life.”In turn, Larry promised Guillermo their married life would be “exciting, adventurous and full of passion.”“I’m proud to take you as my husband. I promise to fly with you to the ends of the earth,” Larry said. “I can’t wait to grow old together and look back at this beautiful moment.”He ended the vows telling Guillermo: “Te amo” – Spanish for “I love you.”The reception was held at a local winery. During the celebrations, Guillermo and Larry danced to Rihanna’s hit “We Found Love,” which includes the lyric: “We found love in a hopeless place.”The couple felt it was fitting – the resort they met at did seem a bit of a “hopeless place.” And they never expected that brief meeting would lead to a lasting love.“We made sure that song was played, because we did find love in a hopeless place,” says Larry.“And I love Rihanna, too,” says Guillermo.At one point, Guillermo and Larry walked through the reception doors holding hands, spontaneously lifting their arms in the air, a “victorious” pose, as Guillermo put it.“It was just an electric effect,” he says.A few years into their marriage, Guillermo and Larry visited Costa Rica together for the first time. Larry was excited to see Guillermo’s home country, and Guillermo was excited to show his husband where he grew up – and the visit was also an opportunity for Larry to finally meet Guillermo’s father.Guillermo was nervous about how the meeting would play out, but when he arrived at his parents’ house with Larry in tow, Guillermo’s father opened his arms and hugged Larry tightly.“He said, ‘Welcome home,’” says Guillermo.It was a cathartic, emotional moment for everyone.“I was so nervous that day, meeting the father-in-law,” says Larry. “And when he just said ‘welcome home,’ and hugged me, every bit of nerves went away. I felt comfortable, I felt welcomed, I felt loved.”Larry says the moment felt like the “last piece” of a puzzle slotting into place. Guillermo was overjoyed.“That evening, which we got to spend – me, mom, dad, and Larry – was just a highlight,” says Guillermo.The family played old records on a turntable. Guillermo and his mother danced in the living room, while Larry and Guillermo’s father sipped cocktails and watched, laughing.“I had to just step back, because you have to look at those moments and just kind of create a little mini movie of them,” says Guillermo.Guillermo’s father has since passed away, which makes Guillermo and Larry all the more grateful for that time together in Costa Rica.In general, a feeling of gratitude defines Guillermo and Larry’s relationship – gratitude for each other and what they’ve brought to one another’s lives, and gratitude that their paths crossed over ten years ago.On their anniversary, the couple usually return to Palm Springs to celebrate the day they met.“Not only is Palm Springs beautiful with a great vibe, but we love to go back and celebrate our meeting place,” says Larry. “We weren’t looking, neither one of us – but it did happen, and it’s definitely for life.”“What a gift,” says Guillermo, who says his life today is what he dreamed of “as a little gay boy in Costa Rica, always loving the US, always loving airplanes, always envisioning that I would have a relationship where we are completely free to show our love.”“And we do, we do,” he says. “Who could ask for anything more?”"

        "title": "The supersonic plane that was faster than Concorde",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Five years before Concorde’s first flight, another majestic supersonic aircraft took to the skies — and almost became the inspiration for an even faster passenger plane.It was the XB-70 Valkyrie, an experimental plane developed for the US Air Force. Its inaugural flight — 60 years ago in September 1964 — kicked off a golden era for supersonic aircraft. The plane would later achieve a speed of just over 2,000 miles per hour, nearly 50% faster than Concorde.“The overall design of the XB-70 was a thing of beauty,” says Tony Landis, a historian at the Air Force Materiel Command in Dayton, Ohio. “To think such an attractive aircraft, with its speed and altitude capabilities, was built over 65 years ago is hard to comprehend in today’s AI and computer-based engineering environment.”The XB-70 program was not without problems: As a military plane, it was obsolete before it was even rolled out, and its short lifespan was marred by a tragic accident. Even regular flights had everyone on edge, as the aircraft’s components were all pushed to the limits.However, its design has made it an icon of supersonic flight: “To this day, people stop and stare at the Valkyrie parked majestically at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, admiring its size and shape,” Landis says. “Most people ask if this is a new design, as they’ve never seen anything like it.”The plane was born out of a competition between Boeing and North American Aviation, then a major aerospace manufacturer that was eventually chosen by the Air Force, in 1957, to develop a bomber capable of carrying nuclear weapons at Mach 2 and 60,000 feet of altitude.However, the downing of an American U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union in 1960 caused a shift from manned bombers to ballistic missiles, and in 1961 President Kennedy billed the upcoming XB-70 as having little chance of penetrating enemy defenses successfully. As a result, just as North American was starting to build the aircraft, the goal of the program shifted to high-speed flight research.The first XB-70 — nicknamed Valkyrie following a naming contest — was rolled out in Palmdale, California, on May 11, 1964. With a wingspan of over 100 feet, six General Electric turbojet engines at the back, and 185 feet long, it was easily one of the most impressive planes ever built.Among its distinctive features were wingtips that remained horizontal at subsonic speeds, but folded down once supersonic to reduce drag. Its main design elements, like the delta-shaped wings and the thin, long fuselage were replicated by both Concorde and its Soviet clone, the Tupolev Tu-144, which even sported two “canards” or winglets right behind the cockpit — just like the XB-70 — giving pilots more control at low speeds.“Throughout the 1960s, both the military and civil sector put vast amounts of resources into developing a supersonic transport,” says Landis. “In the early stages, nearly every aircraft company based its initial design around the XB-70.”As more information became available, Landis adds, these designs morphed into more refined designs like Concorde, as well as other projects that remained on paper, such as the planned Concorde rivals imagined by Lockheed and Boeing.Once it was clear that the Valkyrie’s role as a bomber was set aside, its designers came up with alternative uses for the plane: “North American engineers became very creative, with many different uses for the aircraft,” says Landis, “But the only variant to be given serious consideration was the transport version for military and civilian use.”Three variations were proposed, ranging from a high-density one with capacity for 158 passengers, to a “deluxe” arrangement that allowed for 114 seats and included a lounge area in the center of the passenger compartment.“While the first XB-70 was back at Palmdale for inspections and upgrades, North American took the opportunity to add fake window markings to one side of the aircraft to assist in the marketing of the transport variant. The windows were removed prior to the aircraft’s return to flight testing,” Landis says.It’s hard to imagine what the passenger experience could have been like on such a plane, but according to Landis it would have been a lot like Concorde: “Smooth, quiet, with ample space between the seats. Due to the expense in operating the aircraft and limited seating, the cost would most likely be affordable only to the upper middle class and the wealthy.”Most importantly, it would have been fast, connecting London and New York in just two and a half hours, compared to Concorde’s typical three and a half.Other proposed versions of the plane imagined it as a launch platform for orbital spacecraft and even Minuteman missiles – but just like the passenger version, these never materialized.The XB-70 program was further cut short by a fatal accident that occurred in 1966, during a photoshoot organized by General Electric. The second, and more advanced, of the two existing Valkyries collided in midair with a smaller plane, an F-104N, killing its pilot as well as one of the XB-70’s own pilots, with the other surviving with serious injuries.The destroyed Valkyrie had logged just 46 flights, and the remaining one ended its career after 83 flights — many of which with NASA as a supersonic testbed — and just over 160 hours in the air.The very last of those flights occurred on February 4, 1969, to ferry the plane from what is now NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in California to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, where the aircraft joined the collection of the Air Force Museum.While the program may not have lived up to its full potential, the XB-70’s legacy still stands, Landis says: “All large, high-speed aircraft designs benefit from the work done by the XB-70. And the data from those research flights continues to affect the design of future aircraft.”"

        "title": "‘Black is beautiful’: Why Nigerians think their Guinness is better than Ireland’s",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Femi Oyebade, a Nigerian diasporan for more than 30 years and a Guinness beer connoisseur, assures me that there is a stark difference between Irish Guinness and Nigerian Guinness. Chalk and cheese won’t suffice in defining the distance between the two.Nigerian Guinness has weight in your mouth and is sumptuously smooth. It isn’t as bitter as Irish Guinness and has a lovelier, frothier head. Its sugar content is higher. So, Oyebade tells me, for health reasons a drinker should reduce their intake of pounded yam and other “swallow”-carbs to accommodate the extra blood sugar.The alcohol content of Nigerian Guinness is 7.5%, almost twice as strong as the Irish 4.2%. Oyebade insists you can never drink Nigerian Foreign Extra Import and go back to Dublin dry stout. Never, ever. America, where Nigeria’s Foreign Extra Import Guinness is not typically available, is worse off for its absence.I found these arguments fascinating, especially because my love of Guinness beer is based on its bitter-sweet malted aromatics and their potential as a cooking ingredient.I bake stout and apple wheaten bread regularly with an overdose of Nigerian Foreign Extra Import, switching buttermilk for stout.I slow-cook stewing beef in three-quarters of a can with carrots, leeks, dried Cameroonian peppers and honey.But I can’t drink it. I’m a philistine whose appreciation of the beverage really starts and ends with pleasurable inhalation of the fragrance of cooking Guinness. I suppose that is also a kind of sensory imbibing that can leave you “happy.” There is something about Guinness’s distinct aromatics that hits the spot.How do you drink your stout? It’s an easy question in Nigeria. The intensely dark, bitter, creamy, deliciously frothy-headed elixir with an intoxicating bouquet is democratically drunk all over the country by all.That’s everyone from lactating mothers, perilously sipping thanks to the original Nigerian Guinness adverts from the 1960s that proclaim “Guinness gives you power” and “Guinness is good for you,” to the octogenarian at death’s door terrified of hospitals and sure Guinness cures all ails.Nigeria is the second largest Guinness-drinking nation worldwide. We drink more Guinness than the Irish. And we were the first Guinness-brewing outpost of note, with a representative brew – not barley but maize, sorghum and a unique yeast – created for our national palate.There is a scientific postscript for Femi Oyebade’s avowal of our Guinness’ superiority. It was purposefully tailored to our taste buds using grains that we grow locally and eat every day.The adroit advertising from the 1960s – “Black is Beautiful”– helped Guinness cross firmly from cultural émigré to Nigerian indigene decades ago.In other words, the Guinness brew pretended that it was one of us (Black, beautiful and strong). It attested to how we saw ourselves and plugged into our national identity and we forgot that it was imported.The Foreign Extra Import – our own export of the Nigerian brew – can be found sitting on the shelf (in a 33-centiliter bottle) in every good London corner shop, you just have to know to ask.It’s an efficient identifier. If you say to the man behind the counter “Foreign… Extra… Import,” he will stake his life that you are Nigerian. Our brew is apparently “less” bitter, and roasted darker, than the original Irish Guinness Draught in a can or pub-poured pint glass.We drink differently too.Because it has been many years since I was back in Nigeria, I turned to Nigerian poet, writer, psychiatrist and friend Dami Ajayi for help with beer parlor nostalgiaAjayi tells me there used to be a beer parlour at “Yaba Left” – the informal name of the federal neuropsychiatric hospital in Yaba, Lagos.It was a purpose-built building situated in the old railway compound. The upper floor, called the social center, was forsaken and unhappy but there was a kitchen downstairs rented out to a catfish and pepper soup vendor with a gold tooth.At 4 p.m. every day, the plastic tables and chairs – branded with the beers Gulder, Trophy, Goldberg and so on – would appear in the compound of the building and men would start to fill them.They were rarely alone – no, they were accompanied by women (notably not their wives). The clientele was mostly “bring our girlfriend for fish” men, between 40 and 50 years old, with women half their age. Doctors from the psychiatric hospital and people visiting patients were also part of the gatherings.Outside the perimeter of the building were stalls – Aunty Toyin selling peppered snails and yam, Shehu, the suya smoked meat man with his speciality “tozo suya” beef and someone else selling noodles and eggs.The beer parlor closed at 11 p.m. and people who lived and worked in the area would drink their beer, their Guinness, eat their suya or pepper soup, talk about politics and other affairs, and go home or move on to the guest house nearby.In summary, meat, stout and an essential playlist of classics like Chief Commander Ebenezer Obey’s “The Horse, the Man and his Son,” or “Ero Mi Ko Lonso,”Tunde Nightingale and his Highlife Boys’ “The Bird That Sings All the Night,” Ayinla Omowura’s “Awa Ki ise Olodi Won,” and Dr. Victor Olaiya’s languid crooning of “Baby Jowo.”Sometime in the mid-2010s, there was a Friday night live band. The social center was created with the singular goal of removing the stigma of the psychiatric hospital’s presence in the community.Until its demolition years later, it never achieved its goal. The memory of the beer parlour remains indelible as the place nearby to unwind and drink your “Odeku.”We don’t bother with grandiose descriptive words. Guinness is Guinness. Or it is a big stout, Odeku (60 centiliters), or a small stout, Lanko (33 centiliters). Lanko is so named because it sounds like “lanky” and Odeku sounds like an onomatopoeic neologism for someone stocky and strong.It says something about the ubiquitousness of Guinness in Nigeria that our words for the drink have transcended the division of 500 languages and become big vs small, Odeku vs Lanko. The size of the Guinness beer bottle you buy for a friend or new acquaintance points to how highly you esteem them. There is no middle ground where this is concerned.A demand to the server, “Give him an Odeku,” is flattery plus flourish. An Odeku is twice the esteem of a Lanko or a Heineken. A Nigerian man flirting with a woman won’t buy her a big bottle of Guinness in a beer parlor; he will buy her a Lanko with a glass. But then, of course she can drink as many Lankos as she likes – enough to equal the Odekus – because the protocols of respectful courting have already been observed.In 1992, Nigerian Breweries attempted to create a new brew to rival Guinness and came up with Legend Extra Stout. It contains the eluded barley with sorghum and caramel, but more than 30 years later it has still failed to topple Guinness from its throne.The Guinness brewery in Lagos is almost as old as Nigerian independence, having been brewing Guinness Foreign Extra Stout since 1963 – just three years after the country became independent from the UK.Femi Oyebade speaks for many when he says there is no match for Nigerian Guinness in smoothness or cultured mouth-feel – not even close.My own favourite excuse for “drinking” stout isn’t anything to do with old wives’ tales masquerading as medical therapy nor winding down at the weekend. It is back to the Irish beef and Guinness stew with plenty of hot pepper to suit my Nigerian palate.A good-size filet is the ideal cut. The meat is cut up in generous chunks and browned in vegetable oil in a pan. When it has a good glaze, I put it in a bowl and set it aside. I then fry two chopped-up onions, two large carrots cut up in big pieces and one finely chopped leek in the same oil that I browned the meat in. This deglazes the pan and helps the amalgamation of the meat and vegetable flavors.I then put my meat back in with the vegetables and add about a handful of flour; three quarters (or more) of a can of Guinness Foreign Extra Import; salt; lots of ground-dried Cameroonian pepper and about one-and-a-half to two tablespoons of honey. A little bit of water also helps.The dish is covered and left in the oven on a low setting to cook to absolutely delicious perfection; an hour is certainly not too long.The smell of cooking onions, carrots, meat and stout is indescribable. The “plenty pepper” lifts it out of the melancholy of a London gray sky; helps it to hit that spot. The cooked carrots melt in the mouth oozing the juices of beef and malt. Beef and stout stew tastes so much better the next day. I serve it simply with steamed aged rice."

Longoria called it a magnificently complex and sophisticated sauce.• At Las Quince Letras, chef Celia Florián made Longoria quesillo – a stretched Oaxacan cheese -- with crickets and edible flowers.• In the area of Oaxaca located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, several muxes, who identify as a third gender and are guardians of Zapotecan cuisine, cooked up stuffed pork with pineapple served alongside pureed potatoes. Longoria called it “the perfect combination.”• The farming town of Santa Ana Zegache is the unassuming epicenter of corn. Corn has been worshipped for over 6,000 years and is still the beating heart of Mexican cuisine.• In San Baltazar Chichicapam, Longoria visited a palenque (agave farm) run by Doña Berta, one of very few female mezcaleras. The farm produces mezcal, the smoky liquor for which this region is famed.• La Cocina de Humo is a hip restaurant using local ingredients. Chef Thalia Barrios García is known for her heirloom tomato salad with beet puree and herbal dressing. Longoria said it’s the “perfect dish.” Here’s the recipe.Mayan DNA runs through the recipes in Yucatán, which has the largest Maya population in Mexico.The state is located along the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by dense forests that isolate it off from the rest of the country. The Maya thrived here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The region’s geography and turbulent history have had a significant impact on the cuisine.• Ixi’im mixes modern and ancestral techniques and flavors.

        "title": "London’s futuristic BT Tower landmark to become hotel",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Tourists who fancy getting a top-down view of London may soon be able to book themselves a room in the city’s famous BT Tower.A much-loved part of the London skyline, the former communication tower has just been sold for £275 million ($347 million) to MCR Hotels, which plans to open it up to the public by “repurposing it as a hotel.”According a statement from telecom company BT Group on Wednesday, the sale is “securing its (the tower’s) place as a London landmark for the future.”When the building was completed in 1964 it overtook the Millbank Tower in Westminster to become the British capital’s tallest structure. Situated in Fitzrovia, central London, it was officially opened by the then-prime minister, Harold Wilson, the following year. The main structure is 581 feet (177 meters) high, but an additional section of aerial rigging brings it up to 620 feet.Originally known as the Post Office Tower, the building was designed to relay microwave signals carrying telecommunications from London around the country. However, it has gradually been replaced by the company’s fixed and mobile networks. Its dish-like microwave aerials were removed more than 10 years ago as they were no longer needed.It remained London’s tallest building until 1980, when it was overtaken by the NatWest Tower in the financial district. Both have since been massively eclipsed by the Shard, which towers over the city at 1,016 feet (310 meters) high.The building, which has a grade II listing from national heritage body Historic England, was open to the public for several years, with a restaurant on a revolving floor at the top.In 1971, however, it closed to the public after a bomb explosion on the 31st floor, for which nobody ever claimed responsibility.In 2009, an LED screen was wrapped around the 36th and 37th floors, with a message proclaiming 1,000 days until the 2012 London Olympics. The “information band,” as it is known, has since been used to display many different messages, including the late Queen’s first tweet, in 2014, and advice to “Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives” during the coronavirus pandemic.In a press release announcing the sale of the site, Brent Mathews, property director for BT Group, said the company had been “immensely proud” to own the “important landmark.”He added: “It’s played a vital role in carrying the nation’s calls, messages and TV signals, but increasingly we’re delivering content and communication via other means. This deal with MCR will enable BT Tower to take on a new purpose, preserving this iconic building for decades to come.”This latest addition will bump up MCR’s portfolio of around 150 luxury hotels, including the TWA Hotel at New York’s JFK airport, a reimagining of Eero Saarinen’s 1962 Flight Center.Also in the Big Apple is the Art Deco New Yorker hotel, which has a rich history and has played host to VIPs from John F. Kennedy to Muhammad Ali.Tyler Morse, CEO and owner of MCR Hotels, said in the press release: “We are proud to preserve this beloved building and will work to develop proposals to tell its story as an iconic hotel, opening its doors for generations to enjoy.”Comparing the project to the company’s transformation of the TWA Flight Center, Morse added: “We see many parallels between the TWA Hotel and the BT Tower.“Both are world-renowned, groundbreaking pieces of architecture. It’s been a privilege to adapt the TWA Flight Center into new use for future generations, as it will be the BT Tower.”"

        "title": "A British woman and a French man met on the Channel Tunnel train. Here’s what happened next",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "If she can avoid it, Saphia never travels by airplane.Saphia researches the climate crisis for a living – so that’s partly why, although not entirely. She also just hates flying, period.“My job sort of demands I have an ethical stance on flying,” Saphia tells CNN Travel. “But I never enjoyed it.”So when, in March 2012, aged 26, Londoner Saphia decided to head to Valencia, Spain to attend a music festival with a friend, she immediately mapped out the trip by rail.First up, Saphia booked a seat on the Eurostar, the high speed train that connects the UK to continental Europe via a tunnel running under the English Channel. From there, Saphia was set to travel through France by rail, towards her destination in Spain.On a warm spring Thursday evening, Saphia finished up work and headed to London’s opulent St Pancras Station to catch the Eurostar. She tracked down her carriage and was one of the first to board the sleek blue train, hauling her backpack onto the overhead storage space, and then getting comfortable.“It was an absolutely packed out train,” Saphia recalls. “On Eurostar, you always have reserved seats where you have to sit, and I remember looking out of the window at the other people boarding.”Amid the crowds, there was one passenger in particular who caught her eye. A guy, also holding a backpack, who looked a similar age to Saphia.“He’s attractive,” Saphia thought to herself. And then this stranger proceeded to step onto the train, into Saphia’s carriage and slip into the seat next to her.Saphia couldn’t quite believe it. She kept her composure, smiling a hello at the guy. He smiled back.Saphia’s Eurostar seatmate was a twentysomething Frenchman called Sylvain (Saphia and Sylvain have requested their last names not be included in this article, for privacy reasons). Sylvain had been working for the past year in London, but that Thursday night in 2012, Sylvain was heading back to France to celebrate his Master’s graduation – and possibly for good.“It was basically one year after the final day of uni,” Sylvain tells CNN Travel. “My contract in the UK, in London, was coming to an end. And I was looking for a new opportunity at that time to work somewhere else. The idea of going back to France was starting to pop into my head.”Sylvain noticed Saphia as soon as he sat down next to her. He wanted to strike up a conversation, but didn’t know how – he found it awkward enough chatting to women in his native French. In English, he was even less confident.As the train wove in and out of tunnels, away from London and toward the coast, Saphia kept snatching glances at Sylvain.“For about the first half an hour, I’m sort of looking sideways, trying to catch his eye a little bit,” she recalls.Then, a little while into the journey, Sylvain decided to get a drink from the bar. As he got up, Sylvain introduced himself, and asked Saphia if she wanted to grab a drink too.Saphia smiled, agreed, and the two walked together through the train, towards the cafe carriage. Once there, Sylvain opted for beer, while Saphia asked for a cup of tea – which Sylvain joked was “so British.” Then they sat down in the restaurant car, opposite each other.“We had a drink and, and chatted,” recalls Saphia. “We talked about the Olympics, which was coming up in London later that year. And we talked about our lives.”As Sylvain drank his beer and Saphia sipped her tea, the two discussed London and how buzzy and exciting everything felt in the lead up to the 2012 Summer Olympics. They starting joking about what their respective Olympic sports would be.Then they talked about their respective jobs, interests, where they were from – Saphia explained she grew up in Hull, a port city in the north of England, while Sylvain talked about his childhood in a village in the Nièvre region of Burgundy in France, known for its great wine.Right away, there was a palpable connection between Saphia and Sylvain. They both felt it. At one point, Saphia fired off a quick text to her sister:“Have met hot French man on train. Will see what happens.”As the train sped through the English countryside and into the darkness of the Channel Tunnel, Saphia and Sylvain moved on to discussing their shared a love of traveling – Sylvain had recently returned from a stint in Vietnam, Saphia was planning to backpack around Europe for a few weeks post-festival.The conversation between Saphia and Sylvain felt easy, fun, exciting. When the occasional language barrier or misunderstanding cropped up, they generally laughed it off. At one point, Saphia mentioned an interest in art, and in response, Sylvain tried to sound knowledgeable and suitably artistic, but was acutely aware he didn’t really know what he was talking about.“I was trying to get myself into our discussion, which was way outside of my comfort zone,” he says.For much of the two-and-a-half-hour train journey, Saphia assumed Sylvain lived in France, and it wasn’t until the train was almost in Paris that the two strangers realized they actually lived really close to each other, in the same north London neighborhood.“We were practically neighbors,” says Saphia. “So we had a long conversation, thinking we’ll never see each other again because we live in different countries, but we actually lived around the corner.”When the Eurostar pulled up in Paris’ Gare du Nord, Sylvain and Saphia returned to their seats, grabbed their bags and disembarked the train together. They lingered on the platform, and Sylvain asked Saphia if she’d like to join him at a wine bar nearby, where he was meeting his college friends.Saphia declined, explaining she had a ticket booked on an overnight train. Part of her wanted to abandon the booked train and head out into the night with the man from the Eurostar – but while she didn’t give into this impulse, Saphia did tell Sylvain she’d like to see him again.Saphia liked that Sylvain seemed “quite outgoing, quite adventurous, sociable.”Sylvain says he was also struck by Saphia’s “adventurous” side.“To just be on your own, backpacking with some friends across Europe, that was cool,” he says. “It’s very hard to capture somebody’s personality just in a short journey like that, but I wanted to see her again. We just really hit it off. Obviously something was happening.”The two said their goodbyes (“I think we had a kiss on both cheeks in the French way,” recalls Saphia) and promised to look one another up on social media.“I gave him my full name so he could find me on Facebook,” says Saphia.Then they walked in opposite directions through the busy Parisian station. And as Saphia headed towards the Paris Metro, she found herself thinking: “This is such a romantic origin story that it has to work out.”Later, sitting in her seat on the night train from Paris, Saphia didn’t sleep. Instead, she gazed out the window, reliving her meeting with Sylvain in her head.She remembered Sylvain talking about his picturesque hometown, and she realized the train was heading through Burgundy.“I spent the night looking out, every time we stopped at a station, to see if we stopped there, all night long.”When the train did pull up at the tiny village in Nièvre, Saphia felt a smile spread across her face. She wished she could text Sylvain and tell him.Meanwhile, Sylvain was also basking in the afterglow of the unexpected train connection, but he was convinced Saphia would meet someone else on her travels, or back in London, before they had the chance to reunite.“Obviously she’s brilliant, she’s attractive and sparkly,” he says.In the wine bar with his college friends, Sylvain mentioned that he’d met an amazing girl on the Eurostar. Sylvain’s friends spent the evening teasing Sylvain about the idea that this “Hollywood story” could have any future.But despite their gentle ribbing, and his own doubt, Sylvain still had a glimmer of hope.“I wanted to believe in the story,” he says. “I just thought, there is a chance out of 100, it will work.”Although it was 2012 and smartphones were becoming commonplace, Saphia remained committed to what she describes as a “Nokia brick phone.” The only way she could connect to the internet on her travels was via cobweb-ridden old computers in the back rooms of hostels.After the music festival, during a stopover in Barcelona, Saphia managed to log onto Facebook via one such hostel computer. She had a notification – a friend request, and a friendly message, from Sylvain. He’d sent it two weeks earlier, right after they’d met.Saphia typed out a reply, explaining that she didn’t have internet access on the road, but promising to message Sylvain once she was back in London.Then a few weeks later, when Saphia was back home, she and Sylvain reconnected properly. This time, they exchanged phone numbers and arranged to go on an official first date, to a restaurant on Upper Street, a road lined with bars and restaurants in London’s Islington district.Their easy Eurostar rapport returned, and they were both excited to see each other again.“We were both nervous at first, but we hit it off very quickly,” recalls Saphia.On their second date, Saphia and Sylvain went to Stratford, in the east of the UK capital, to see the London Olympic stadium being built, which Saphia calls “very exciting.”Sylvain and Saphia started meeting up regularly, enjoying meals out and long evenings chatting about their lives. It was exciting, but throughout this period, Sylvain wasn’t sure if he would stay in London or end up moving to Paris. Meeting Saphia was another reason to stay in the UK, but Sylvain knew the fates might not align to let that happen – he had to go where the work was, and he was taking job interviews in both countries.Sylvain explained the situation to Saphia, and the two of them decided to take things slowly, both conscious that Sylvain moving to France could spell the end of their burgeoning connection.But when, in September 2012, Sylvain got a job in Paris and relocated there, he and Saphia decided to commit to long distance.“We didn’t want to go our separate ways,” explains Sylvain.And so began what Sylvain calls “the second leg of our story where Eurostar became a central point of our relationship.”The two regularly traveled by the train across the Channel to visit one another.“We were traveling back and forth, every week, every two weeks, taking it in turns,” says Saphia.This state of play lasted two years. Sometimes it was romantic, even glamorous, to hop onto the train where they’d met and reunite at St. Pancras or Gare du Nord.But most of the time, it was just difficult being apart. And all that travel was “expensive and exhausting,” as Saphia puts it.“You can imagine, long distance for two years is heavy on a couple,” says Sylvain.Finally, after two years of train station goodbyes, Sylvain got a job back in London.“It was really a big relief,” he says.The night he found out the job was his, Sylvain went out celebrating with his friends in Paris.Over drinks, he told them he was planning to propose to Saphia. He’d wanted to for a while, but the confirmation they were finally going to be in the same country made Sylvain certain this was the right moment.When Sylvain started considering the proposal, a plan came to him almost fully formed – it was obvious how the evening should play out.So one evening after work, while Saphia was cooking dinner in their north London apartment, Sylvain bounced enthusiastically through the door and suggested they head out for the evening.“I was in the middle of cooking spaghetti bolognese when Sylvain said, ‘Let’s go out for a drink,’” recalls Saphia. “I said, ‘No, because I’m cooking.’”Sylvain was insistent – not only that they should head out, but that they should go into central London, rather than walking down the street to their local pub.“That was all very strange and I was a bit miffed because I didn’t plan to go out that evening,” recalls Saphia.Sylvain and Saphia ended up at St Pancras Station, on the second floor, near where the Eurostar trains depart and arrive. They walked towards the station’s towering, romantic bronze statue of a couple embracing, officially called “The Meeting Place,” but often known as “The Lovers.”“That was where he got down on one knee,” says Saphia, “Next to the big statue,”It was, Saphia laughs, “a bit cheesy.”“But it was basically where we’d met – where the Eurostar trains all line up on the platform. It was fitting.”For Sylvain, St Pancras and the renowned statue, was “the natural place” for the proposal.After Saphia said yes, she and Sylvain went to the then newly opened London skyscraper The Shard for celebratory drinks overlooking the city’s glittering skyline. Then the couple headed back to St Pancras to spend a night in the historic red-bricked Renaissance Hotel, which neighbors the station.Sylvain and Saphia laughed as they ran up the hotel steps, where the Spice Girls filmed the music video for “Wannabe.” The next day at breakfast, they ate what Saphia calls “the best full English I’ve ever had.”Sylvain says he saw the engagement as an “accomplishment” after the sometimes grueling long distance period.“We were ready to start living our life as a young couple in London,” he says.Saphia and Sylvain enjoyed two wedding celebrations in the summer of 2016. The first took place in Hull, in the north of England, where Saphia grew up.“The registry office is actually in the library, but it’s in the French history room of the library,” says Saphia.This French-link felt appropriate – although turned out to be mildly awkward when, on the actual wedding day, the library happened to be hosting an exhibition on the Battle of Waterloo.“So we invited all these French people over and they sat in this room with all this memorabilia about how the British defeated the French at Waterloo,” says Saphia, laughing.A few weeks later, Saphia and Sylvain continued the celebrations in Sylvain’s hometown in Burgundy, France. They threw “a massive party in a great big barn in the countryside,” recalls Saphia.“People came actually from all over the world, from everywhere, to party with us,” she says. “It was three days in the end, that party.”It was a hot summer’s weekend, so the wedding guests stayed out all night “dancing in the field and partying outside.”“Everybody had a fantastic time,” recalls Sylvain.The countryside location was “really magical,” adds Saphia. There was no light pollution, just stretches of rolling fields, illuminated only by starlight.“At night, you can see the Milky Way in the sky,” says Saphia. “It’s really beautiful, really beautiful surroundings.”The couple honeymooned in Venice, and then spent the next few years embracing their shared love of travel via European city breaks, as well as making the most of life in London.It wasn’t all smooth sailing. In 2016 – around the time Sylvain and Saphia got married – the UK voted for Brexit, deciding to leave the European Union.As a French-English couple who were proud of their European identity, and who’d made the most of the EU’s freedom of movement, the Brexit vote “really sent shockwaves,” as Saphia puts it.The couple questioned whether to stay in the UK. Meanwhile, Sylvain applied for British citizenship and Saphia secured French citizenship.In the end, the couple’s jobs – plus their circle of international, like-minded friends – kept Saphia and Sylvain in the UK.In 2019, they welcomed their first child. And after spending the UK’s first Covid lockdown in a small London apartment with a toddler, the couple relocated to Saphia’s hometown of Hull, where they still live today.At the end of last year, Saphia and Sylvain welcomed a second child. Their children are dual nationals and their oldest, who is now five, speaks fluent English and French.“It’s nice to see him switching from one to the other. And now we have a baby, four months old, he is teaching his baby brother to speak,” says Saphia.For Saphia and Sylvain, traveling remains a shared passion – they’re excited to travel more with their children in the future.Sylvain says they both enjoy “discovering new countries, new cultures, new regions,” although they “both have different ways to discover the same countries.”“You like the beaches and the parties and the people,” Saphia says to Sylvain. “I like the city life, the culture and architecture.”Plus, while Sylvain travels by airplane, Saphia’s still committed to traveling by train wherever possible. She’s been on the odd flight with Sylvain over the past 12 years but jokes that his hand has never recovered from her squeezing it so tightly during take off and landing.While Saphia and Sylvain no longer have St Pancras Station on their doorstep, the couple still spend a lot of time traveling to France by train.“Every time we go back to see Sylvain’s family, we travel by Eurostar, and we take our kids and it’s a nice memory,” says Saphia.Sometimes, when they board a busy Paris-bound train with their young family, the couple find themselves thinking about how their Eurostar meeting “was absolutely random.”They could have been traveling on different days, on different trains, in different carriages – or simply not been seated next to each other.“When you think about it, it seems like a chance out of a billion,” says Sylvain.Saphia still thinks “it’s quite romantic to meet that way.” She also enjoys the symbolism, “the French and English connection – the Entente Cordiale between the two countries, that’s how the tunnel got built in the first place. It’s a nice symbol.”Sylvain appreciates the romance too, but says when he looks back on their 12 years together, he’s proudest of their perseverance.“Of course, how we met was incredible,” he says. “But what impresses me the most, I think, was the first two years of our relationship, when we were long distance – we really wanted to make it happen.”Saphia also laughs whenever she recalls her text to her sister. She suggests her younger self probably wouldn’t be surprised that the “hot French man” she met on the train became the love of her life.“I think if you’d gone back and told me then: ‘This is the person you’re going to marry’ – I think I would have said, ‘OK, I’m up for that,’” says Saphia.“I was in an adventurous frame of mind. Anything felt possible. And I think I maybe had an inkling in the back of my mind from the beginning that it was going to work out somehow.”"

        "title": "A short history of the long fight over breakfast tacos",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos.In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of habañero-hot debate.A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue.But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico.The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate.There’s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN “Searching for Mexico” series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo León.There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Doña Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.“The breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it’s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,” narrates Longoria.CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel – born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years – to find out more.“When I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.”Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as “a really fast food, but not a junkie food.”Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo León are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.Some of the city’s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you’re in meat country.Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey.Compañia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came “to work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.”And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. “I think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.”Along with Doña Mary’s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you’re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony’s Tacos.The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them.“No Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,” says José Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande.“It comes from Mexico – where exactly, it’s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.”As for today, “they’re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila, which all border Texas,” he said.Eddie Vega – who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state – is known as “Taco Poet of Texas.” He points out that historically, what’s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.Before 1836, “the border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.”Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren’t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media.“When you get to south Texas, and I’m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It’s not something we’d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody’s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.”Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them?Austin has “a great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,” Ralat said. “They try some options, and then in their minds, they think it’s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff … and let history speak for itself.”Ralat said San Antonio has “a bit of an inferiority complex that they’re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it’s more diverse, and the food is better.”“To be clear, they’re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they’re also border food. When the Eater article came out” – championing Austin as “home” of the breakfast taco – “San Antonians lost their minds.”Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. “I don’t know that one city – San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo – can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.”Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them.“I think at this point we’ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,” Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. “Is there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.”She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.She also points out the regional differences within Texas.“A flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.”Ralat said he’s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.“I hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. … I want the food to be high quality. I don’t want it to be spin.”Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them – with or without huevos (eggs).“Breakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,” she said.“Bean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn’t have eggs. … Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn’t require eggs. Barbacoa – made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks – is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.”In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter?“Part of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you’ve part of that conversation for a long time.” Vega said.And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.“I think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey … and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.”They’re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. “The place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.”For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning.“I think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture.“It’s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let’s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That’s so nice. And it’s just so joyful.”"

        "title": "A Ramadan etiquette guide for non-Muslims",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "There are more than 8 billion people in the world. And about a quarter of them are fasting from sunup to sundown. Every day. For an entire month.It’s Ramadan, and it’s the holiest month of the Muslim calendar. In 2024, it runs from March 10 to April 19.But what if you’re not a Muslim and instead just a caring, considerate person. Is there anything you should do so you don’t come across as insensitive to your fasting friends in the United States or abroad during Ramadan?Short answer: No. Long answer: No.But you can earn some cool points if you follow these 10 tips:For the 30 days of Ramadan, Muslims around the world will abstain from eating and drinking during daylight hours. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t carry on business as usual. (Just turn a deaf ear to our growling stomachs.)If you have to host a brown-bag, you should. But don’t feel bad if we sit there, like a vegetarian friend at a churrascaria. Ditto for a happy-hour mixer. If your Muslim co-worker takes a pass, understand.You can if you want to see what it feels like. But it’s not going to hurt our feelings – even if we’re best friends.Iftar is the breaking of the fast after sundown. We like to make it a big communal meal. You should come.Ramadan isn’t like Christmas or Thanksgiving, as in everyone knows exactly when it’ll fall. It bounces around, because the Islamic calendar is lunar. When it begins depends on when the new moon is seen. That’s why the precise dates change from year to year.How we determine when Ramadan begins is decidedly old-school: You have to physically see the moon (even though there are apps for that). That’s why, if your co-worker says, “Starting tomorrow, can I start work early so I can leave sooner?” try to accommodate.No, we can’t drink. Not even water. But we’ll walk with you if you want to take a break.One word: Halitosis. You try not eating or drinking for the entire day. That’s why we’re standing a foot away from you when we talk.There’s no “war on Christmas”-level controversy surrounding the greeting (it means “Happy Ramadan”). Your Muslim co-worker will appreciate the thoughtfulness.Ramadan’s not about that. Plus, one of Ramadan’s side effects is obesity (it’s all that post-sundown overeating)."

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "When planning a trip to India, the “Golden Triangle,” comprising Delhi, Jaipur and Agra, often comes to mind as a must-see region. And these historic destinations do indeed provide a classic introduction to the country.However, India boasts an array of natural wonders that provide ample opportunities for the more active traveler to get out and explore.The terrain encountered during a hiking odyssey in subcontinent-sized India is as diverse as the cultural fabric that weaves this extraordinary nation together.Here, one can encounter towering peaks of the formidable Himalayas and undulating plains that whisper tales of ancient civilization in the northern region. Towards the southern reaches, the forest-cloaked Western Ghats mountain range abounds with vibrant flora and fauna.Numerous local guides and trekking agencies are on hand to help you conquer these trails. Check out the Indian Mountaineering Foundation for a list of the country’s registered tour agencies.If it’s inspiration you’re after, here’s a rundown of 12 of the most epic hikes in India, ranging from quick, casual hikes to multi-day excursions.Distance: 37 kilometers (30 miles)Time: 7 daysSuitable for all levels, the Buran Ghati trek begins from the ancient hamlet of Janglik, about a five-hour drive from Shimla, the former summer capital during British colonial rule.The terrain is never boring, as you pass through deep forest onto wide green meadows and across gurgling brooks under the shadow of snow-covered peaks, en route from the Daraya campsite to the Dunda campsite, enjoying views of glacial lakes like Chandranahan along the way.Hikers will need to be well-acclimatized as the trail crosses a 4,572-meter (15,000-feet) pass on day five.The true adventure lies in the descent from the pass on the other side, leading to the verdant Barau village, marking the culmination of this remarkable odyssey.During summer (mid-May to June), a thrilling rappel of about 400 meters (1,312 feet) down a steep ice wall awaits, while in autumn (mid-September to mid-October), a steep descent amid rugged boulders provides an exhilarating experience.Distance: 9 kilometers (6 miles)Time: 1 dayStraddling the borders of Manipur and Nagaland in the northeastern part of the country, Dzükou Valley is a giant green carpet that annually erupts into a riot of wildflowers, including the rare pink Dzukou Lily, which is only found here.July is peak flower season, but the valley is gorgeous all summer.There are two routes – most hikers start from Viswema Village, about 22 kilometers (14 miles) south of Nagaland’s capital city Kohima, while the trailhead at Zakhama Village, about 18 kilometers (11 miles) from Kohima, is shorter but the ascent is sharper.The path climbs up rough-hewn stone steps and through a mix of chestnut, juniper, and oak thick forest, to reach the crest of the valley at 2,452 meters (8,045 feet) above sea level, where a riveting panorama unfolds.It is possible to stay in the guesthouse run by the Southern Angami Youth Association (SAYO) in the valley, but the hike can also be completed as a day trip.Indian nationals must acquire an Inner Line Permit (ILP) to visit Nagaland, while foreign visitors must register themselves at the local Foreigner Registration Office (FRO) within 24 hours of arrival.Distance: 63 kilometers (39 miles)Time: 5 daysAn absolute humdinger of a route, this trek takes in three high passes of the Himalayas and seven glacier-fed lakes.Accessible from July through to September, the trail starts in the small hamlet of Shitkadi near Sonamarg, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of the city of Srinagar and takes you over alpine meadows and grasslands before ending in the village of Naranag.On day five comes the real treat – spectacular views of the biggest of the Satsar Lakes and the twin lakes of Gangabal and Nundkol.While the hike isn’t particularly strenuous, you’ll need to spend a couple of days acclimatizing in Sonamarg beforehand to prepare yourself for the altitude of 4,200 meters (13,780 feet).Trek Kashmir, a local travel agency, can arrange meals, camping equipment and transfers to and from Srinagar.Distance: 73 kilometers (45 miles)Time: 8 daysIf you’re up for a challenge and view that ranks among India’s most sublime, consider this trek in West Sikkim.The hike can be steep and tough, with 3,048 meters (10,000ft) of elevation gain and three suspension bridges over deep gorges to negotiate.What really lodges this hike in your memory is the view of Kangchenjunga, the world’s third-highest peak, from Dzongri Top at 4,167 meters (13,670 feet).The route also cuts through Khangchendzonga National Park, revered by the local Lepcha tribe.Big wildlife rules here: red pandas, blue sheep, elusive snow leopards and blood pheasants can be found on this trail.Starting and finishing in Yuksom Village, the trail is best hiked clockwise to acclimatize for the challenging ascents towards the end.Numerous campsites and huts are spread along the trail, best completed during spring and fall months, i.e. April to May and September to November.Distance: 65 kilometers (40 miles)Time: 6 daysWhisking you through wild landscapes within Hemis National Park, situated in the eastern region of Ladakh, the hugely popular Markha Valley epitomizes the extraordinary beauty of Indian nature.The trail begins in the village of Chilling, about 66 kilometers (41 miles) from Ladakhi capital Leh and ends at Shang Sumdo, swinging from gentle to moderate in difficulty as the terrain changes.There are barley fields and thickets to traverse, hanging bridges to cross and rocky canyons to negotiate.Crossing the icy waters of Markha River (a tributary of the mighty Zanskar River), seeing the ancient Buddhist monasteries and 6,400-meter (21,000 feet) Kang Yatse and 6,153-meter (20,187 feet) Stok Kangri peaks, and climbing up to the 5,200-meter (17,060 feet) Kongmaru La Pass are moments you’ll rave about for the rest of your life.There’s some wonderful wildlife too – blue sheep, Asiatic ibex, Himalayan marmot, Ladakhi urial and the endangered Eurasian brown bear all hang out in the park. Snow leopards make a rare appearance only during the winter months.Nights spent camping under starlit skies or indulging in a warm meal at a village homestay along the way.Acclimatize in Leh before embarking on this trek. July to September is the optimum period for hiking here.Distance: 8 kilometers (5 miles) round tripTime: 7 hoursA spectacular carpet of rare and exotic wildflowers is the trademark landscape on this dreamy hike, best tackled during the monsoon season (July to September).There are a variety of trek distances available, but one of the most popular and shortest options begins and ends in Ghangaria, a popular base camp for visitors wanting to visit the valley.Stay the night here for an early start in the valley, which opens its gates at 7 a.m., with trekkers being granted entry until 2 p.m.Ascending and descending inclines while crossing the Pushpawati River, the route finally reaches the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Valley of Flowers, bedecked with over 500 species of flowers against a backdrop of glaciated mountains.This protected area also serves as a habitat for Asiatic black bears, blue sheep and snow leopards, albeit sightings are rare.As one of the most popular hikes in India, you won’t be alone, so there’s no need for a guide here.Distance: 18 kilometers (11 miles)Time: 4 hoursNestled in the heart of Chikkamagaluru district in India’s Western Ghats, the 1,894-meter (6,214 feet) Kudremukh Peak is the third tallest summit in Karnataka state.It’s an easy day hike to reach the summit, traversing through shola (virgin forest), small streams and rolling green hills.Keep an eye out for endemic wildflowers and the occasional lion-tailed macaque, langur or Malabar giant squirrel.Most hikers base themselves in the village of Mullodi, where one can purchase the requisite entry permit from the local forest office.It pays to get an early start as trekking after 6 p.m. is prohibited, and only 50 hiking permits are issued per day.It’s best to hike the trail during post-monsoon and winter months – September to February.Distance: 45 kilometers (28 miles)Time: 6 daysFor intrepid adventurers, exploring the rainforest wonderland that is Namdapha on foot is the epitome of off-the-beaten-path hiking.Located in the eastern Himalayas, this out-and-back trek starts from Deban, a rough 26-kilometer (16-mile) drive from the petite town of Miao, where permits are issued at the Field Direction’s Office.The trail crosses varying landscapes – small rivers, patches of forest and grassland and a short bit of gravelly terrain.Birdwatchers will find themselves captivated by the five species of hornbills and other avian species found along the way.The forest is also home to mammals such as the clouded leopard and Bengal tiger, though sightings are rare. Mischievous red pandas and gibbons can occasionally be spotted amidst the foliage as well.Although lodging is available at the Forest Rest House in Deban, to make the absolute most of the path and visit the local tribes like Lisu and Tangsa who have inhabited the region for centuries it’s best to book the trek through a registered local tour operator.The best time to hike here is mid-September to April.Distance: 4 kilometers (2.5 miles)Time: 3 hoursThe area around the mountainous Wayanad region in northeast Kerala, stretching along the Western Ghats, is home to several scenic walks.A favorite among those looking for a tranquil and easy-to-moderate hike is Chembra Peak, perched at an elevation of 2,100 meters (6890 feet) above sea level.The trail starts from the watchtower near the Chembra Peak VSS Forest Office – a short drive from the quaint hamlet of Meppadi – and winds its way through emerald tea plantations and wild grasslands.While reaching the summit is prohibited, visitors can climb up to the heart-shaped lake, known locally as Hridaya Thadakam or Hridaya Saras, near the peak.Best tackled between November and February, the trail is open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., and entry is limited to 200 hikers per day. Secure the permit from the forest office before 2 p.m.Distance: 14 kilometers (8.7 miles)Time: 6 hoursA three-hour drive from Siliguri, Tiger Hill is a popular weekend destination for city dwellers so go during the week to avoid the crowds.The trail to the summit of Tiger Hill starts in the town of Sonada in India’s Darjeeling district, passing through organic farmlands and orchards before reaching Chatakpur Village.After overnighting there, continue uphill towards the watchtower, a mere 10 minutes from the village.From the tower, the path leads to an enthralling expanse of Senchal Wildlife Sanctuary, home to a diverse array of Himalayan wildlife like black bears, barking deer and macaques, plus avian species like Blue Magpies and Old World Flycatchers.The final leg involves an ascent to a creek, offering vistas of Tiger Hill’s green terraces.At the summit, enjoy stunning panoramas of Darjeeling town below. And if the weather is clear, you can get magnificent views of the Kanchenjunga ranges.Walk the route from October to April, when the weather is pleasant.Distance: 25 kilometers (16 miles)Time: 5 daysForging a path between the verdant Kullu Valley and the barren, high-altitude deserts of Lahaul and Spiti, Hampta Pass – standing at 4,270 meters (14,010 feet) above sea level – delivers one stunning vista after another as it strides from Jobra, about two hours northeast of the hill resort of Manali, to Chhatru Settlement via wildflower-flecked Jwara Valley.Highlights are many but you’ll never forget clapping eyes on the snow-capped peaks of Deo Tibba (6,001 meters/19,688 feet) and Mount Indrasan (6,221 meters/ 20,410 feet) from the top of Hampta Pass on day four.Trekkers can camp en route at designated sites like Chika, Balu Ka Ghera and Shea Goru.If you’d like to add a little extra adventure, continue north from Chhatru, the end-point of the Hampta Pass trek, to Spiti’s east-west highway and embark on a two-hour drive to the captivating Chandra Tal (‘Moon Lake’), perched at 4,250 meters (13,944 feet) above sea level.Weather permitting, Hampta Pass is open to hikers from June to September.Himalayan Yeti Adventure and Himalayan Caravan Adventure can take care of the logistics.Distance: 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) round tripTime: 1 dayOne of India’s most stirring natural wonders is the Living Root Bridges, crafted by indigenous Khasi villagers out of Indian rubber tree roots.Over 100 of these humble river crossings are found in the Meghalaya hills, with a notable concentration in the jungle-laden Nongriat Village.Accessible from Tyrna village, 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) southwest of Cherrapunji – one of the wettest places in the world – the hike begins with a descent of more than 3,000 stone steps before venturing into the dense rainforest, which is alive with butterflies and insects. The finale is the centuries-old double-decker living root bridge.Logistics are easy for the Nongriat hike - there are many drink and snack stalls en route.While guides are not obligatory, they’ll help you get acquainted with the local communities.Hike between April to June, as the weather is comfortably warm. But do bring a rain jacket and sturdy, waterproof shoes, as conditions can change at the drop of a hat."

        "title": "Irish names you’re probably saying wrong and how to pronounce them",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Do you know your Gearóid from your Gobnait? Your Fearghal from your Muirgheal?To the untrained eye, Irish names can seem like a daunting ambush of rogue consonants and surprise vowels.That’s because while the Irish language uses the same Latin alphabet letters as English, they represent different sounds and have different spelling rules.Here’s a guide, with audio clips, on how to pronounce some common Irish names. We also have some Irish language hacks so you can figure out names yourself.Read on to find out why Sinéad starts with “Shin,” how a “h” can turn a “b” into a “v,” and why you’ll never hear “St Patty’s Day” said in Ireland.To help navigate the minefield, CNN has called in help from Irish language and culture expert Darach Ó Séaghdha, author of the books “Motherfoclóir” and “Craic Baby.”So if you see “Oppenheimer” star Cillian Murphy in the street and want to congratulate him on the Oscar win, the first thing to remember is that there’s no K in the traditional Irish alphabet.When you see an Irish name beginning with C, it’s always a hard C, Ó Séaghdha explains. So Cillian is “Kill-ee-an.” The Germanized version, Killian, used to be the dominant spelling in Ireland, says Ó Séaghdha, but in 2003 – the year after Murphy’s breakthrough movie “28 Days Later” was released – the C spelling took over and has reigned supreme ever since.That same C rule goes for the boys’ names Cían (Kee-an), Ciarán (Keer-awn) and – here you need to forget everything you learned from the US singer of the same name – the girl’s name Ciara (Keer-ah).If you’re familiar with Irish actor Saoirse “rhymes with inertia” Ronan, our pronunciation might seem like a curveball. But here’s another hard rule: expect the unexpected.There are three Irish dialects – Connacht, Munster and Ulster – and the way names sound often varies with regions and accents. Our audio clips are with a northeast accent, influenced by Ulster Irish, so might not sound exactly as you’ve heard the names said before.Typically a girl’s name, Saoirse, meaning “freedom,” first became popular in the newly independent Ireland of the 1920s and has most commonly been pronounced “Sorsha” or “Seersha.” Saoirse Ronan’s twist on it is “partly her accent,” reckons Ó Séaghdha, but it’s already fast on its way to becoming a new dominant pronunciation.So if you’re not sure how someone says their name, just ask.That apostrophe you see on the O of Irish surnames is an Anglicization of a “síneadh fada,” an acute accent slanting to the right. A fada above a vowel means the vowel should be pronounced “long” – which is what fada means in Irish.Fadas are often dropped in English, but in Irish pronunciation they are crucial. Take the first name of Irish-American talk show host Conan O’Brian. When anglicized it’s “Co-nin,” but with native pronunciation Conán is “Co-Nawn.” Likewise with Ronan (Ro-Nin) and Rónán (Ro-Nawn) - which, incidentally, means “baby seal.” Aww.Éabha is pronounced with a long E and sounds similar to the name “Ava,” but it’s actually “the way Eve is spelled in the Irish language Bible,” says Ó Séaghdha.And why is that bh pronounced like a V? We’ll get to that soon.The most famous Siobhán in modern times is Shiv from the TV show “Succession,” played by Australian actor Sarah Snook, but how does Siobh become “Shiv”? Ó Séaghdha – whose full name, if you’ve been wondering, is pronounced Da-rach (rhymes with Bach) O Shay – explains.“In Irish, you’ve got broad vowels and narrow vowels. When an S is next to a broad vowel like an A or an O, it sounds like ‘Sss,’ but when it’s next to a narrow one like I, it’s ‘Sh.’” It’s called the “caol le caol” rule.The name Sean has a fada when written in Irish – Seán (Shawn) - which is why the endings of Seán and Siobhán rhyme with “lawn” and not “can.” Another example is Aisling – meaning “dream” - which is pronounced Ashling (and sometimes spelled that way too).You’re still wondering about that bh, aren’t you? Okay, we’ll explain.Because fadas are dropped in English, Ó Séaghdha says a quick hack is often to “look at the Hs. If a h comes after another consonant, it’s usually softening it. ‘Bh’ and ‘mh’ are often treated like a single letter and pronounced ‘v’.” Hence - drumroll, please - Siobhán.The alarming gaggle of letters above is one of Ireland’s oldest girl’s names and has more variants than it has consonants. It can be Medb, Méabh or Méibh, but Maeve is the closest to English phonetics – it rhymes with “wave.”Let’s give it up now with a bualadh bos (“boola bus” – round of applause) for the girls’ names Dearbhla (Dervla), Aoibheann (Aveen), Caoimhe (Queeva or Keeva), Sadhbh (Sive), Ailbhe (Alva) and Niamh (Neeve).This masculine name was once so ubiquitous that it became an ethnic slur for Irish people (and, as “Taig,” for Northern Irish Catholics), in the same manner as “Paddy” or “Mick.”The g is clearly heard in Tadhgh, but, depending on the consonants around it, the “g” in “gh” might not be heard at all. Take Bronagh (Bro-nah) or Oonagh (anglicised as Una), for example.The presence of the “h” also assists the disappearing act done on the “d” in Odhrán (Or-awn) and the “m” in Domhnall (Do-nal).“Saltburn” star Barry Keoghan is yet another Irish actor making waves in Hollywood right now, but his pronunciation of his surname isn’t the standard form. His name is said “Barry Kyo-Gann’ with a hard “g,” but typically this name would sound more like “Kyo-ann.”Says Ó Séaghdha, “It’s a lot like the ‘gh’ in ‘through’ in English. If you can get your head around the ‘gh’ in ‘through’ in English, you can get your head around the one in Irish.”Here’s another one where the “d” takes a day off. The girl’s name Fiadh (Fee-ah) is perhaps “the biggest Irish name of the 21st century,” says Ó Séaghdha. It was the second most popular girl’s name in Ireland in 2023, after Grace.“In the late 20th century, popular Irish names tended to come from mythology – Deirdre, Niamh, Oisín and Gráinne – but in the 21st century there’s been a shift towards adjectives” and nouns, he says. Fiadh means “grace and wildness” while Rían (Ree-an) – the fourth most popular boy’s name in Ireland last year – means “kingly.”Says Ó Séaghdha, “There’s been a vibe shift in the kind of Irish names people are picking.”Oh, and this is as good a time as any to mention that the name for the Irish language is “Irish” or – in the language itself – “gaelige” (the pronunciation varies by dialect). If you want to impress your Irish pals, don’t call it Gaelic.Here’s one with some regional variation. The boy’s name Oisín and the girl’s name Róisín are Ush-een and Rush-een in most parts of the country, but O-sheen and Ro-sheen in others. When a fada appears over an i at the end of a name, it always sounds like “een.”Witness the transformative power of the fada in the Irish version of the name Maureen: Máirín. They’re pronounced exactly the same. See also Máire and its anglicised forms Maura and Moira.A fada on the girl’s name Áine turns it into “On-ya” and the feminine moniker Gráinne (Grawn-ya) also undergoes a similar transformation.Take a deep breath, don’t panic, you can do this. Caoilfhionn is simply “Keel-an.”“The ‘fh’ is the very hardcore version” of this unisex name, says Ó Séaghdha. As the “fh” isn’t pronounced, “it’s often spelled Keelan because the Irish language version terrifies. “They’ve seen the ‘gh’ before but then an ‘fh’ sounds bananas.”Variants of Caoilfhionn include Caolán, Caoileann, Kealan and many more. There are a few reasons for all this wide variation in Irish spelling, says Ó Séaghdha. One is that “often those names were popular before people knew how to spell. A relatively old name like Meadhbh would have different versions because people spell it different ways.”Another reason is that “there were different stages of spelling normalization in the Irish language. In the 1950s, they decided to kind of modernize the alphabet.” That’s when a lot of simplified, anglicized spellings took off.Finally, Ireland is an English-speaking country where only a small minority claims to speak its native language “very well.” So, says Ó Séaghdha, “Another part of it is, yeah, people just having a go.”See that D right there? That’s why you should never call it St. Patty’s Day. Pádraig (pronounced Paw-rig or Pawd-rig) is the Irish version of the anglicized name Patrick. Its many variants and diminutives include Pádraic, Pádhraig, Páidín and Páidí (Paddy).Patrick is often shortened to the anglicized Pat or –- going back to those Irish roots – Paddy. Patty is never to be heard. So in Ireland, the holiday is St. Patrick’s Day, Paddy’s Day, or nothing.Oh and those names at the start of the story? Hopefully we’ve given you some tools to make a fair stab at them by now, but a wise gaeilgeoir (“gwale-gore” – Irish-speaker) never assumes. They are, of course, Gearóid (Ger-ode – pronunciations vary), Gobnait (Gobnit), Fearghal (Fergal) and Muirgheal (Mur-yal)."

        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Long lines. Feeling bleary-eyed and exhausted after an overnight flight. Scrambling to get your documents ready.For most international travelers arriving in the US, going through immigration and customs is another step in the travel process – and it can take a little while.But international travelers arriving from a select group of airports, including Ireland’s Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport, step off the plane and breeze through domestic arrivals, whether they’re US passport holders or not.That’s because Dublin and Shannon Airport are two of the 15 airports across the globe that offer US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) preclearance, allowing all travelers to go through US immigration and customs before they board a plane heading stateside. That means upon arrival on US soil, travelers bypass CBP and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) inspections.Preclearance has been around for decades, but unless travelers happen to transit through one of the airports where it’s offered, it’s not necessarily on their radar. Nor do they necessarily realize that international preclearance facilities are staffed by US border force officials – not local airport workers.In fact, CBP has more than 600 officers and agriculture specialists stationed at 15 airports hubs across six countries: Dublin and Shannon in Ireland; Aruba; Bermuda; Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates; Nassau in the Bahamas; and Calgary, Toronto, Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver, Victoria and Winnipeg in Canada.Here’s how US preclearance works, and what it’s like for the American citizens who move from the US to Ireland to work the border abroad.Travelers transiting through airports offering US CBP preclearance begin by checking in and going through security, as they would at any other airport. But rather than subsequently browsing duty free or grabbing some food, they head to preclearance and go through US border inspection there and then.Travelers transiting through airports offering US preclearance can’t opt out, but officials suggest the only disadvantage of preclearance for travelers is the need to factor it into airport arrival times.But lines at preclearance are generally shorter than those experienced by US arrivals on US soil – because generally speaking, fewer people are being processed at any one time.Niall Kearns, airport director at Ireland’s Shannon Airport, tells CNN Travel preclearance “can save you hours.”“I think people have maybe had previous experience of going to the States and just being stuck in immigration lines for a long time,” says Kearns. “But you can get all this done in a very hassle-free, quick manner in Shannon and then arrive in New York or Boston or Chicago.”Plus, CBP recently introduced a mobile passport control app, which allows travelers to begin the process of preclearance before they even arrive at the airport. The app’s now in use at Shannon and Dublin airports.The goal is the app will speed everything up, says Robert Murray, an assistant director who oversees preclearance operations from his base in the US.“People are not always prepared for being inspected when they come through a preclearance location, because they’re kind of taken by surprise by it,” Murray tells CNN Travel.“Because of the timelines that we face with trying to make sure people are getting to their flights, we really wanted to push the use of mobile passport control and people downloading the app and being ready for their inspection a little bit sooner.”US preclearance is arranged via a legal treaty – a formal agreement signed between nations. That treaty stipulates that American officials can conduct their full immigration inspection in the host country.One notable difference is US CBP officers working in Ireland are unarmed, in line with Irish law.Murray – who worked as a preclearance border officer in Dublin, Ireland for six years before taking on his current role – explains that if anyone is, for example, pulled over for extra checks during preclearance, US CBP officials “will complete the inspections that we’re working on to the logical conclusion that we would in the States.”If they decide the individual isn’t fit to fly, they return them to local immigration officials, “which is no different really, then it would be if you were stateside, except that we just happen to be in the same building,” explains Murray, adding it’s “a much quicker process, and obviously less consequential to the person, which is a nice benefit of preclearance.”In 2014, then-secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, praised preclearance by using an American football metaphor: “I’d much rather defend our end-zone from the 50-yard line than from our one-yard line,” he said. “I want to take every opportunity we have to expand homeland security beyond our borders.”Murray also suggests screening travelers before they board a flight to the US is smart from a US security perspective.“I think anytime that we have an opportunity to speak to someone, to do a full inspection on someone, before they board a flight bound to the US – I think that that’s advantageous for all parties involved,” he says. “For safety and security, being able to stop persons from boarding a flight that shouldn’t be on a flight, and make sure that people that should be on the flight are safe – I think it’s always advantageous to do that before.”While many travelers enjoy the ease offered by preclearance, the program isn’t without its controversies.In 2017, for example, in response to then-President Trump’s travel ban on Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, the Irish government ordered a “complete review” of the preclearance system. However the system remained unchanged following the review.Preclearance was originally called pre-inspection, and dates back to 1903, when it was first offered for passengers sailing from Victoria, Canada to the American Pacific Northwest.In the 1950s, as commercial aviation took off, pre-inspection became preclearance. Ireland became the first country outside of North America to offer the program in the 1980s, at Shannon Airport. Dublin Airport followed suit in the 1990s.Murray suggests “the already existing long history of diplomatic relations certainly fostered them choosing Ireland as the first location outside of North America for preclearance.”He stresses that establishing preclearance abroad is “not a US alone decision.”“The US has to do an evaluation of any location and determine if there is a security benefit for us to go,” he explains. “But at the same time, the host nation also has to see a benefit in having us come.”The CBP has certain design standards that are required for preclearance hubs. In some cases, airports can refurbish existing facilities. Other times new facilities may be built.Shannon Airport’s Niall Kearns says this involves host airports “investing significantly.” But preclearance is good for airport business, he adds – especially at Shannon, which also offers preclearance for private jet travelers, as well as commercial travelers.This commercial benefit is often the impetus for host airports signing preclearance facilities. Kearns says Shannon Airport is proud to offer preclearance, and hopes it helps attract airlines and passengers to choose to transit through their aviation hub.While establishing preclearance facilities involves collaboration from the US and the host country, every preclearance facility is staffed entirely by American nationals.Murray says that while locals he met in Ireland tended to be aware of the US CBP presence there, people from elsewhere in the world were often confused when they heard American accents at the Dublin Airport facility.“I think one of the biggest misconceptions is that we are Irish, and that we work for the Irish government,” he says.Of course, some CBP officials may be dual nationalities – but they are also “all American citizens, all full fledged law enforcement officers working for the US government overseas,” explains Murray.So how does the US staff international preclearance locations?Murray says preclearance jobs and other international postings are available to CBP officers via an open application process – CBP personnel aren’t stationed at preclearance locations abroad unless they want to be.“For all of our preclearance locations, the people that are going to these locations, are people that have applied to go there,” explains Murray.For Murray’s part, he worked as a CBP officer in the US for several years before he took a preclearance job in Abu Dhabi. Working in the UAE gave Murray “a taste of what the experience of being in preclearance was like, and I really enjoyed it.”“And so being in Europe and working in a preclearance location was really desirable for me,” he explains.Murray applied to work in Dublin in 2015 and moved to Ireland the following year.“I actually arrived at St. Patrick’s Day of 2016. It was a very long day, as you can imagine, I was very tired,” says Murray, adding that he “didn’t really get much out of the experience” of the Irish holiday that first year.But over his six years living and working in Dublin, Murray enjoyed getting involved in local holidays, embracing traditions and generally getting to know the city, and country, where he was living.“One example is I made a personal choice to join a gym where I knew none of my colleagues were,” Murray says, explaining he wanted to force himself “outside of the comfort zone to meet new people, specifically in the community.”He also enjoyed taking advantage of Dublin’s easy proximity to the rest of Europe.“You have your base in Ireland and you can travel anywhere that you want to within Ireland but then you also have the airport available for quick easy access to other places in Europe,” he says.Murray says living abroad was an “amazing” opportunity, but says there are also – as with any job that involves relocating – some challenges.While many CBP officials relocate with their families, Murray moved solo.“For the amazing experience it is that the government gives us – the great experience it is especially working in Ireland – it is a definitely a commitment and an adjustment for a lot of people,” Murray says, explaining you “go from a situation where you’re surrounded by your family, or you have close friends and family, to going to a place where you might not know anybody.”But the CBP officials stationed abroad look out for each other, Murray adds.“You do kind of become reliant on each other. You watch out for each other, look out for each other,” he says, adding this extends beyond the airport to the “larger embassy community.”Officers moving to Dublin are assisted with finding accommodation by the local embassy, whereas officers moving to Shannon must make their own living arrangements. Instead, colleagues will offer each other tips and tricks on where to live.From his position at Shannon Airport, airport manager Kearns enjoys seeing how the US airport workers adapt to their new home.“It’s really been great to see how they settle into local communities around County Clare and around County Limerick,” says Kearns. “I know from speaking to some of them, they love spending their time off going hiking, or going visiting different cities and exploring the Wild Atlantic Way while they’re here.”American CBP officials are permitted to spend a maximum of six years working abroad at preclearance locations before they must return to the US.Murray worked in Ireland for that full duration. And his current job might be based stateside, but he regularly checks in with his colleagues abroad – his present role involves helping “make the lives and the experience overall for the employees overseas” smooth.And as well as maintaining work links in Dublin and Shannon, Murray returned to Ireland last summer for a vacation.“I have a number of friends that I’ve remained in contact with over there,” he says.Overall, Murray says he enjoyed working in Dublin because it gave him “a much more expanded worldview of how other people think and how other people live.”"

        "title": "How to survive a shark attack – or better yet, avoid one entirely",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "First things first: Despite some truly terrifying tales of survival, you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon.But sharks do occasionally attack humans – and they certainly make news when they do:• Rockaway Beach Park in Queens, New York, was closed to swimming and surfing on August 8, one day after a woman was hospitalized after suffering an apparent shark bite.• A teenager was bitten by a shark on the foot in early July as he was surfing off the coast of New York’s Fire Island.• A Russian citizen was killed by a shark in the Red Sea in Egypt on June 8.• A shark attacked a woman from Connecticut while she was snorkeling at a resort in Turks and Caicos on May 24.While these kinds of encounters understandably cause would-be ocean swimmers to worry, there’s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation. The chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low despite the headlines.The Florida Museum of Natural History’s International Shark Attack File found only 57 confirmed, unprovoked shark bites on people and 32 confirmed, provoked bites in 2022 worldwide.Think about it a minute – the world population is more than 8 billion people. Many of those live near or vacation at the coast. And only 89 bites were logged. Your chances of drowning are much, much higher.In 2022, the United States led the way in unprovoked attacks at 41; Florida had the highest state total at 16.That said, you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack, according to shark experts interviewed by CNN Travel.Know your environmentSharks are salt-water creatures. The ocean is their home; we are the visitors.“If you’re going to the ocean, you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is,” said Neil Hammerschlag, director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.“Fortunately, humans aren’t on the menu, and also fortunately, sharks tend to avoid people.”Still, there are places you’re more likely to encounter a shark.River mouths are not the best place to swimYou should avoid estuaries, said Richard Peirce, an author, shark expert and former chair of the UK-based Shark Trust and Shark Conservation Society.Their often-murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks, which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks.“An awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths, where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river – people washing their clothes, people washing themselves,” said Peirce.Hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely: deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out.Avoid areas with fishingBefore you jump in the sea, have a look around the horizon: What do you see? If you see fishing boats, Peirce says “forget it.”“Whether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational, material will often be being discarded, and unwanted dead fish, fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks,” he said.Before you go in, watch for unusual fish activity, such as a whole bunch of small- and medium-sized fish jumping out of the water, Hammerschlag said. That’s a possible sign a shark might be nearby.He also advised to not swim within roughly 50 yards of where someone is fishing from shore.Avoid dusk and dawnSwimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely, but it’s also the time when a shark attack is most likely.“A lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity,” Peirce says, “due to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark.”Hang with lifeguardsChris Lowe, professor in marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, advises to “do your homework” before you go into unfamiliar waters. Bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places.If you have any questions, ask a local lifeguard. He said they are a great resource.“I always recommend people go to guarded beaches. It’s a lot safer,” he said.Don’t wear shiny objects in the water“Be careful with jewelry, anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish.” Lowe said.In murky water, a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal. “And you don’t want your hand or foot to get confused with that.”Follow your instincts“Probably the most important thing is to follow your gut,” Hammerschlag said. “If you feel wary about getting in the water … just don’t go in the water.”“A lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that, like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn’t listen to it,” he said.Don’t panicSo you’re being circled by a shark. The worst thing you can do right now is panic.“Don’t start splashing around – you’re just going to excite, incite and encourage the shark’s interest,” said Peirce.Humans, apes, dogs and cats all have paws and hands. If we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it, we feel it, we put it to our nose.“A shark has got no paws or hands, so if it wants to explore something, the only capability it’s got to do that is to put it in its mouth,” said Peirce.“That’s why we often get exploratory bites which don’t result in death and sometimes don’t even result in serious injury. If you go swimming and splashing away, you’re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite.”Maintain eye contactAs the shark swims around you, keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact.“Sharks are ambush predators,” Peirce explained. “If you’re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you, it’s not going to be half as comfortable as if it’s able to sneak up from behind.”Hammerschlag concurred, saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you’re following it. Then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore.If you’re surfing, track the shark with your board, Lowe said. “Let the shark know it’s being watched.”Marine biologists and shark divers Adriana Fragola and Kayleigh Grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks. In a viral TikTok video (see top of story), the shark is seen as Fragola splashes away, capturing its attention. She turns around, faces the approaching shark, remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand.“You’re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you,” Fragola says in the video.Stay big or get smallThis is where it gets complicated. If a shark is clearly in attack mode, you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water, according to Peirce.“The bigger you are in the water, the more respect you’ll get,” he said.But if the shark seems to simply be passing through, Peirce’s advice is to roll up into a ball.“If a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source, that can be one reason it attacks you,” he explained.“If I didn’t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor – and if it wasn’t showing massive interest in me – I would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me.”Don’t play deadThis isn’t a bear, it’s a shark. If you find yourself in an aggressive encounter, give it hell: punch, kick and poke at sensitive spots – but be careful where you aim.“There’s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose. That’s OK, but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth,” said Peirce.“This is a moving object in the water and you’re not staying still either, so what you don’t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it.”A good shot to the gills can also do the job: “The gills are very sensitive – giving a shark a whack in the gills isn’t a bad idea.”Are you carrying anything with you? If so, turn it into a weapon.“If you’re a diver with an underwater camera, use it, if you’re a snorkeler, rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark,” Peirce says.“I’ve had a lot of sharks come at me, and it’s (been) enough to use a shark billy – a small metal rod between two and three feet long – and I’ve just given them a little nudge on their nose.”It’s a good idea to swim with other people, Lowe said. Not only does that decrease the chances of an attack, he said, but you’ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten.Cut off the anglesIf you’re a diver and you run into trouble, try to get into a position where the shark can’t get behind you, says Peirce.“Keep your back to something like a coral reef. Then you’ve only got one direction to look. You’re protected from behind, for example, and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is.”Slowly back awayDisplace the least amount of water possible. Try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore.“You must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water. Again, you’ve got to be careful – large sharks can attack in very shallow depths.”Doing the above may help to a degree, but Peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim.“If a white shark is in full attack mode, there’s not much you’re going to be able to do at that point,” he says."

        "title": "Gigantic new aircraft design aims to create the largest plane ever to fly",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "There’s a global energy crisis and onshore wind farms are a potential growth option. Larger wind turbines produce more power than standard ones, but the components are too big to be transported by road.What’s the solution? A Colorado-based energy startup named Radia has an idea. It’s developing the biggest aircraft in aviation history.Meet the WindRunner airplane, whose mission will be to deliver gigantic 300-foot-long blades directly to wind farms.To help the world meet its decarbonization targets, it’ll use sustainable aviation fuel and needs only a simple packed-dirt or gravel runway to land on.It’ll operate from regional hubs, says Radia, delivering where needed – and “can land on airstrips as short as 6,000 feet (1,800 meters), something no other large commercial aircraft can achieve.”When it comes to carrying the largest payloads ever moved by air, dainty just isn’t going to cut it.So WindRunner will have a cargo bay volume of 272,000 cubic feet, enough to hold three Olympic swimming pools. That’s 12 times the volume of a Boeing 747-400 and – at 356 feet in length, it’s 127 feet longer too.As for the wingspan, that’s 261 feet – imagine four bowling lanes laid end to end.It will also dwarf the Antonov An-225, the heaviest aircraft ever built, which was destroyed at the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The aircraft’s scale might be groundbreaking, but the engineering is not – and that’s by design. Radia says it’s focusing “on existing technology and safety by using, where applicable, tried-and-true aviation materials, components and fabrication techniques that have FAA [US Federal Aviation Administration] approval, are already in mass production and are lowest-risk.”The idea is to hit the ground running with a fast, well-built fleet that meets aerospace industry standards. Online reports say commercial operations as soon as 2027, but there’s no timeline confirmed on Radia’s website. CNN has reached out to the company for comment.Radia is banking on research organisation Bloomberg NEF’s estimation that up to $10 trillion will be spent on onshore wind through 2050. The development of WindRunner is to enable GigaWind, the XXL turbines made by Radia’s partners, which include five of the world’s top six turbine manufacturers.Currently, turbine blades today are ordinarily 230 feet or less (70 meters), but Radia wants to deploy blades of up to 104 meters (341 feet). The company says GigaWind turbines could potentially be two to three times more powerful – and two to three times more profitable than those typically deployed today.So who are the folks behind these ambitious claims? The founder and CEO is Mark Lundstrum, a cross-industry entrepreneur and MIT aerospace engineer who founded Radia in 2016. The company says its team of advisers include former top brass from Boeing, MIT, Rolls-Royce and the FAA, as well as former US Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull.It’s an impressive lineup and the decision to focus on safe, existing technology is a smart one. Might we see a WindRunner take off before the end of the decade? Could its distinctive shape one day be as popular as the Beluga XL transporter planes created by Airbus? Watch the skies."

        "title": "South Koreans mourn as country’s first celebrity panda, Fu Bao, heads to China",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "Ever since her 2020 birth, Fu Bao has been one of South Korea’s biggest celebrities, with fans eagerly following every milestone of her life at Everland Resort’s Panda World, a theme park in Yongin city.But the country’s most famous and beloved giant panda is set to bid South Korea a final farewell in April, with preparations now underway for her journey to her new home in China.During the last week of Fu Bao’s public viewing earlier this month, visitors reportedly endured wait times of 5-6 hours just to catch a glimpse of the celebrity bear for a mere five minutes, as the park restricted viewing times to manage the influx of visitors, according to park officials.On Fu Bao’s last day of public viewing on March 3, she received farewell gifts, including a panda family doll crafted from bamboo, a bouquet of flowers and heart-shaped pieces of bread from her dedicated keepers at Everland.Born to parents Ai Bao and Le Bao in July 2020 as part of China’s “panda diplomacy” program, Fu Bao is South Korea’s first naturally-bred panda.In the days following her birth, Everland’s social media channels offered fans a steady diet of Fu Bao videos, with its YouTube channel pulling in more than 1.2 million subscribers and, as of February, surpassing 500 million cumulative views, according to the park.A two-hour video chronicling Fu Bao’s journey from birth to childhood added to the Everland YouTube channel eight months ago has garnered 1.6 million views.The most recent videos on the channel are now filled with warm and heartfelt messages from viewers, including the beloved cub’s self-proclaimed “online aunties.”“Fu Bao, you’re a happy treasure that came to us like a miracle during the difficult Covid pandemic,” reads one Youtube comment.“Your auntie’s been so happy to have known you and you made me smile so much. You’re a clever one so I’m so sure you’ll do well in a new environment!”Another commented that they “can’t believe how time passes so quickly” and that “we have to let Fu Bao go. I’m so sad to let her go … I support our Fu and love you. Every moment knowing you has been a great joy with laughter. Thank you.”Thanks to Fu Bao’s widespread popularity, her dedicated zookeeper has also found himself in the spotlight, becoming a bit of a social media star himself.Often referred to as her grandpa, Kang Chul-won offered his own farewell message for Fu Bao, noting that the Korean people’s special love for her all began with social media videos shared during the Covid pandemic when the zoo was closed.“She brought help and happiness to a society in many ways that was having a difficult time due to the coronavirus,” Kang said in a video posted to YouTube.During remarks to the press earlier this month, he said people visited the social media sites every day so it felt like he was “raising her together with them.”“Of course there are aspects of her cuteness and playfulness, but they cared so much for her and they shared the same emotions of raising a cub together during such difficult times,” Kang said.Though one could argue it’s impossible to identify a single social media moment that catapulted Fu Bao to stardom, there are a couple of standout videos that have been particularly popular with viewers.In one video, Fu Bao clings tightly to Kang’s leg, unwilling to let go, as he spins gently around the room. After many attempts to uncoil her strong arms, he finally separates himself from her.The other short video shows Fu Bao clinging to Kang’s arm while relaxing on a wooden bench. As the zookeeper gently pushes her arm so he can take his phone out of his pocket, the panda links her arms tightly around his left arm.After he motions to show something on the phone to her, she rolls onto her back.In an announcement from Everland, the company says Fu Bao will be transferred to the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan Province in early April.Everland said that it will keep her in a separate space at Everland Panda World for a month to prepare her to adjust to her new environment before her overseas transfer, which will be carried out in accordance with international regulations.According to the agreement between Samsung C&T, the parent company of Everland, and the China Wildlife Conservation Association, mature pandas must be returned to China before they turn four years old.Once Fu Bao departs for China, there will be four giant pandas left at Everland – Fu Bao’s mother Ai Bao, father Le Bao, and their twin babies Rui Bao and Hui Bao, who were born last July."

        "title": "They fell in love three decades ago. Now they pilot planes together",
        "category": "travel",
        "text": "On their first flight together, Joel Atkinson and Shelley Atkinson couldn’t contain their excitement. They enthused to the flight attendants. They posed for photos. They told passengers via a pre-flight announcement.“We made a big deal about it,” Joel tells CNN Travel.Then, right before take off, Joel and Shelley sat side by side in the flight deck, just the two of them. They’d come full circle, and were about to embark on an exciting new chapter.“It felt amazing,” Shelley tells CNN Travel.“As we prepared to take off, I was giddy, euphoric,” says Joel.Joel and Shelley met as twentysomethings flying jets in the US Air Force. They became fast friends, then, over time, fell in love.Today, they’ve been married for 27 years and counting. They’ve brought up two kids together. And now they’re both pilots for Southwest Airlines. They regularly fly together, with Joel as captain and Shelley as first officer.The couple say working together is “amazing.” They treat layovers as “date nights.” They learn from one another’s respective “wisdom and judgment.”And no, they don’t argue mid-flight.“People ask us, how does it work, flying together?” says Joel. “We know a few pilot couples and some of them fly together, some of them don’t. I’ve heard people say, ‘Oh I could never fly with my wife or my husband.’”For Joel and Shelley, working together is seamless – a joy that comes easily to them both.“We’re best friends,” says Shelley.“There’s just that unspoken bond,” says Joel.Shelley grew up in Iowa and moved to Colorado – Joel’s home state – as a teenager. The two spent their high school years unaware of one another, but they graduated the same year, and both opted to study at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado in the late 1980s.Joel says he was very influenced by the 1985 Tom Cruise movie “Top Gun” – “which made flying jets look like a lot of fun.” For Shelley, who was an athlete, the appeal of the Air Force Academy was less about flying – which she only really discovered once she was enrolled – and more an opportunity to play college basketball.“I didn’t attend the Academy to pursue flying, initially. Once I was there I realized it was a great opportunity for a fun and challenging career,” she says. “And the introduction to flying there made me want to pursue it further.”Joel and Shelley spent four years studying at the Air Force Academy without actually crossing paths, although Joel was vaguely aware of Shelley.“There’s not that many women at the Air Force Academy, so I kind of knew who she was,” he says.The two finally met a few years later, after they’d both completed pilot training in different states. They got the same first assignment – flying Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in Texas.When Shelley arrived in Texas, Joel had been there for a few months.“So I was there, kind of established, and she came into the office where I was working,” he recalls. “She came in and turned in the paperwork, and we said, ‘Hi,’ just exchanged some pleasantries.”Joel was struck by Shelley right away.“She’s tall. She looks great. She left the room and this other coworker was just looking at me smiling. And I said, ‘What?’ And he could tell.”Looking back, Joel thinks it was the “eye contact” he had with Shelley that gave his feelings away. Or maybe just “the look on my face.”“There was something there,” says Joel, smiling. “But I just kind of laughed it off. I was like, ‘Nah, we’re just going to be friends.’”Joel was also a bit intimidated by Shelley – he was “attracted to her right away,” but didn’t know if she’d ever be interested in him.“She’s taller than me. And I had never dated anyone taller than me,” he says. “She’s an athlete, she’s a natural leader, and just an impressive person.”But Joel’s warm nature appealed to Shelley. She felt comfortable around him right away. They became close friends.“Joel has a really great sense of humor,” says Shelley. “I love that about him. And he just really has a sensitive heart to people, all people around him, he looks out for people.”“That really attracted me to him. And also, he used to have a nice dark head of hair. I really liked that too. But he has a very distinguished look now, and he’s just as handsome as ever.”About a year after they first met, Joel and Shelley were deployed abroad, together.That’s when they “kind of started dating,” as Joel puts it. While there wasn’t much opportunity to go on actual dates on active service, they bonded.“Conversations, talking about everything, basically,” says Shelley. “We really got to know each other’s heart that way. And I think it just made it clear that this is what we were supposed to do.”Back home in the US, the two “started officially dating.”“We just kind of knew that this was going to be it,” says Joel. “And within a few months, we got married.”Joel and Shelley became instructor Air Force pilots in Mississippi. Then, in the early 2000s, Shelley gave birth to the couple’s kids, two twins, a boy and a girl. Shelley left flying around this time, but she stayed in the military, working for the US Air National Guard.“I wanted to be at home,” says Shelley.The path to pregnancy wasn’t easy for the couple and Joel calls their kids a “huge blessing.”“We went through in vitro a couple of times,” he says. “It took a few years for us to actually get pregnant.”The family relocated back to Colorado and Joel transitioned from military flying to commercial flying, becoming a pilot with Southwest Airlines in 2006.Cut to 2021. The pandemic years were tough going for Joel and Shelley, emotionally speaking. While the couple stayed healthy, their kids were in their late teens and struggled with the upheaval. Plus, Covid was impacting the aviation industry, so Joel was flying less. Around this time, Shelley left her job at the National Guard. She and Joel were wholly focused on their family and their kids’ wellbeing.But in time, the pandemic waned and Joel started flying more regularly. Joel and Shelley’s kids graduated high school and started the next phase of their lives. It was a transitional period for the Atkinson family, and in turn, Shelley started considering her future.She found herself dreaming about flying. She hadn’t been behind the controls of a plane in over two decades, but she felt a call to return. She started wondering if, like Joel, she could become a commercial pilot.When Shelley voiced the idea to Joel, he was immediately enthusiastic.“I said, ‘Come fly with me,’” says Joel, joking “cue the music.”Then, by coincidence, later that day, Joel saw a social media post from his airline, Southwest, about a pilot who’d taken a two decade break to raise a family, then returned to flying.“She literally had the same story as me,” says Shelley.It felt like a sign. While Joel didn’t know this other pilot directly, he was able to reach out to her via his work network and pass on contact details to Shelley, who subsequently texted the other pilot, asking for guidance and advice. Then, with encouragement from her new friend – plus Joel’s wholehearted support – Shelley committed to returning to the skies full time.While Shelley had years of Air Force experience, she hadn’t flown airplanes for 20 years. She had had to hit the books, take additional tests and ensure her qualifications were up to speed.But before long Shelley was hired by SkyWest Airlines, flying regional jets. Then she joined Joel at Southwest in 2023.“It was crazy. It happened way faster than I thought it would. It’s been amazing,” says Shelley.“It was meant to be,” says Joel.Joel and Shelley credit their success as a co-pilot team to their nearly three decades of marriage, as well as years of co-parenting.“Raising two teenagers during Covid, I tell people that was a lot harder than what we’re doing now,” says Joel.Plus, the two met as colleagues – so they know how to balance commitment to a job with enjoying each other’s company.Still, as a married couple in the military, Joel and Shelley never flew in the same aircraft.“The military kind of frowns upon it,” says Joel. “It’s a little morbid, but they don’t want you to both go down in a plane crash.”No such guidelines exist in commercial aviation, and so once Shelley joined Southwest, she and Joel were able to work side by side. Joel’s seniority allows him to regularly bid for flights with Shelley. And the two find Joel’s years of commercial aviation experience pairs well with Shelley’s fresh take.“She looks to me and relies on me for the experience that I have. But I also know that she is a very sharp person, she just went through a lot of training. So her knowledge is fresh. And she also has that wisdom and judgment,” says Joel.Since the excitement of their first flight, Joel and Shelley tend not to “make a big deal” about being a husband and wife pilot duo – unless it’s preempted by their colleagues.“We wait for them to ask,” says Shelley. As the couple share the same last name, often crew members put two and two together.As Joel’s the more senior of the two, he often runs the pre-flight briefing. Sometimes he’ll end it with a quick, throwaway: “Yes, we’re married.”The crew usually “start laughing,” says Joel.When Joel and Shelley are taking off and landing, they’re focused on the job at hand. “It’s very technical,” says Joel. “We’re running checklists.”But when the airplane reaches cruising altitude, “there’s some downtime” and Joel and Shelley will make the most of it, talking through their thoughts on life, their kids, their future plans and everything else that’s on their mind.“It’s so great, because all the years that I was flying, and she was at home, anything I wanted to talk to her about when I’m up in the air, it had to wait,” says Joel. “You’re saving up conversations until you’re home. It’s like now we’re making up for lost time.”Then, when they land, Joel and Shelley make the most of the layovers. Southwest largely flies domestically, so the couple enjoy traveling the length and breadth of the US together.“It is a great job, because you go see different places and spend time in different cities,” says Joel, but before Shelley joined Southwest, Joel says layovers sometimes felt like “wasted time, because it was just me, and I couldn’t share it with her.”“But now we’re together when we’re on the road – it’s so fun. Because every night on the road, it’s a date night together,” he says.Now, instead of counting the days until he’s home, Joel says his “home is right here” because “she’s with me.”While Joel and Shelley have flown together countless times since Shelley joined Southwest, they’ve yet to fly with their kids in tow. That’s on the to-do list – plus, their son is also training to be a pilot, so there’s a chance Shelley and Joel might pilot an aircraft with him in the future.For Shelley, an additional perk of the last couple of years is her adult kids getting to “view her as a pilot for the first time.”Shelley and Joel’s children grew up knowing their parents met flying jets – but while they saw their father regularly piloting airplanes for Southwest, they never saw Shelley flying. Shelley is really happy her children get to see her doing a job she loves.Shelley’s also proud to be a female pilot in an industry that’s still very male-dominated. She hopes to inspire other people, especially mothers who may have taken a break from the workplace to raise a family, by demonstrating that returning to a passion is possible.“I hope it encourages other women that there is this opportunity out there – you can come back and you can still do it,” she says.Shelley says she’s really loved rediscovering her love of flying.“The view from 36,000 feet is pretty awesome,” she says. “Flying over parts of the country - I just love looking down and going, ‘Oh, what town is that?’”Shelley and Joel particularly enjoy flying in and out of San Diego, California, but they also love it when Southwest takes them to New York. Before Christmas, they enjoyed a stopover in New York City and went searching for the settings of their favorite movies, from “Elf” to “Serendipity.”“I love traveling, seeing new places,” says Joel, who adds that he’s gone from avoiding working weekends to voluntarily signing up for Saturday and Sunday flight shifts. He and Shelley now spend Saturday nights watching jazz in Portland, going on hikes in Sacramento or drinking cocktails in Palm Springs.Joel’s always loved flying – especially what he calls “the art and science” of aviation. He also loves “serving people, getting them to where they need to be,” but he admits flying during the pandemic was hard going. For Joel, having Shelley now by his side at work has “been just a complete turnaround.” Now even the ride to work is fun as the couple car share, coffees in hand.Joel and Shelley, who post about their adventures on their Instagram account @luvpilots, are currently planning to pick up a flight together on Valentine’s Day. Joel bought the two of them heart-printed ties especially – they’re “silly, but fun,” says Joel.The couple enjoy chronicling their travels on social media – celebrating their marriage, their respective careers and their adventures.“We feel blessed. We’re thankful for the opportunity,” says Joel. “We’re thankful to Southwest Airlines for letting us do this together.”“If you love doing something, why not do it with the person you love?” says Shelley."

        "title": "Neeraj Chopra has gained unlikely stardom in India. If he wins another Olympic gold, he will be ‘treated like God’",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "In a line-up of India’s sporting heroes, most of whom have gained celebrity status through cricket, Neeraj Chopra is an anomaly.In fact, the champion javelin thrower has barely bowled a ball or swung a bat since his childhood, even though he can’t help but notice the similarities between his discipline and his country’s favorite past-time.“I feel that in India, it’s natural, a fast arm,” Chopra tells CNN Sport. “And it’s a basic thing in javelin throwing – if you have a fast arm, you can throw far.”The South Asian country is home to more than 125 million cricket fans, according to a 2022 report by Ormax Media, but Chopra’s ability to hurl a javelin close to 300 feet has earned him a sizeable following in his own right.His stardom has only grown with each passing success. After winning Olympic gold in Tokyo three years ago – the first Asian athlete to do so in the javelin – Chopra was crowned world champion in Budapest last year, becoming the first Indian to win a world title in a track and field event of any kind.It perhaps comes as no surprise, given his historic career to date, that the understated 26-year-old has proven a hit back home.“So many people from my country, they support me, they watch my competitions,” says Chopra. “Even if I’m competing in the Diamond League, they stay awake until one or two at night and they watch my competition. It’s really amazing that people support athletics.”Such is his popularity that August 7 is now celebrated as National Javelin Day in India, the anniversary of Chopra winning his Olympic gold medal in Tokyo.Prior to Chopra, India had practically no history in track and field, winning most of its Olympic medals in field hockey and wrestling.But now there is genuine excitement each time the superstar athlete competes, and as he jockeys up a runway with a quivering javelin in hand, a nation holds its breath.“You ask anybody in India who their favorite sportsperson is at the moment, unanimously the answer will be Neeraj Chopra – despite the fact that athletics is not a popular sport,” veteran journalist Norris Pritam, who last year published a book on Chopra’s life and career, tells CNN Sport.“On the other hand, cricket is a popular sport, a common man’s sport. People talk, breathe, eat cricket, it’s kind of a religion. But still, Neeraj Chopra is the best sportsperson. He’s a hero. He’s absolutely a hero in India.”Growing up in the rural village of Khandra in the northern state of Haryana, Chopra played cricket and volleyball – another sport in which a fast arm can be a useful weapon – in his pre-teen years.He was overweight as a child – carrying what he has recently described as “excess flab” – and was frequently told that sport wasn’t for him. But that all changed as soon as he caught sight of a javelin shimmering through the sky at an athletics stadium in the nearby city of Panipat.“It was a very random thing for me because there was no background in my family or my whole village – nobody was an athlete, nobody knows about javelin throwing,” says Chopra.“When I go to the stadium … I really like how the javelin flies and how it’s going like fish swimming in the sea. I really like this thing, and even now when I throw, I always enjoy how the javelin flies.”This was in 2011, and it was enough for the then-13-year-old Chopra to be inspired to try the sport for himself.His father and uncles, part of a family of farmers, pooled together enough money to buy a steel javelin, and it was in a plowing field near the family home that Chopra attempted some of his first throws.A seed was soon sown, and the fledgling athlete would spend hour after hour launching throw after throw.“He started without any training, without any family background, without any sort of formal school where there could be a javelin thrower,” says Pritam. “In fact, the school in the village had no culture for sport, no grounds for sport.”Before he had any proper coaching, Chopra relied on YouTube videos to hone his technique. His talent soon became evident, and after moving to a sports academy in the city of Panchkula, his arm speed got faster, his throws further, and international competitions quickly followed.Today, Chopra’s resumé is long and impressive, boasting two Asian Games titles and a Commonwealth Games gold medal on top of his world and Olympic triumphs.He is the favorite to defend his title at the Paris Olympics, which get underway on July 26, though he’s not allowing thoughts of further success to enter his head at this stage.“My main focus is to stay healthy,” says Chopra, “but I’m not taking the pressure of winning a gold medal again. I’ll just do my training with 100% of my heart and I’ll give my best … That day will decide who will win a medal.”Performing under pressure, particularly with such a huge fanbase back home in India, has been a common theme of Chopra’s career. His popularity doesn’t faze him, instead feeding his self-belief right down to his final throw.“This is not pressure for me,” he adds. “I feel really good when people are talking about me and they say, ‘Okay, Neeraj can win this medal, Neeraj can throw far.’ I always take these things positively.”Having won his first world title – previously, the most obvious gap in his trophy cabinet – last year, Chopra now wants to throw beyond 90 meters (about 295 feet), which he describes as a “magical mark” in javelin throwing.Only 24 men in history have ever thrown further than 90 meters, but Chopra’s personal best is only six centimeters (about 2.4 inches) shy of that distance; it is more a matter of when, rather than if, he can tick off that goal.In India, however, he has nothing more to prove, his status as a national hero already secured.“Everybody knows Neeraj,” says Pritam, “because his posters are there, his billboards are there, he’s in books and magazines and everything.“You put on the TV and you find Neeraj there talking; he’s a brand ambassador to hundreds of things – sanitation, education, selling products on television. He is a moving billboard, one can say now.”And if he wins a second gold medal at the Olympics? “He will be treated like God,” adds Pritam.Chopra, rarely overwhelmed by such adulation, is taking public recognition in his stride. He nearly always trains and competes outside of India, but when he is back home, he is often struck by his far-reaching influence.“When people meet me, they always say, ‘Our son or our daughter will also start javelin or athletics, and they can also win a medal for India,’” says Chopra. “This is a good thing for me.”"

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "FIFA President Gianni Infantino has condemned the violence that broke out after Trabzonspor fans stormed the pitch and attacked Fenerbahçe players following a Turkey Süper Lig match Sunday.The brawl broke out after the final whistle as Fenerbahçe celebrated its 3-2 win.Security forces tried to shield Fenerbahçe players, as fans stormed the pitch.“The violence witnessed after the Turkish Süper Lig match between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe is absolutely unacceptable – on or off the field, it has no place in our sport or society,” Infantino said in a statement released on social media.“I have said it before, and I will say it again – without exception, in football, all players have to be safe and secure to play the game which brings such joy to so many people all over the world.“I call on the relevant authorities to ensure that this is respected at all levels and for the perpetrators of the shocking events in Trabzon to be held accountable for their actions,” Infantino added.Following the match Turkey’s interior minister Ali Yerlikaya confirmed in a post on X, that authorities had launched an investigation into the brawl and to identify the fans who had stormed the pitch.In a statement released on Sunday, the Turkey Football Federation said, “We are in communication with our representatives and state officials regarding the events that occurred during and after the match played between Trabzonspor A.Ş. and Fenerbahçe A.Ş. in the Trendyol Super League.“What happened in football, which is a game of friendship, peace and brotherhood, is never acceptable.“No one should have any doubt that once the investigations are completed, necessary criminal sanctions will be imposed on those responsible for these incidents to prevent them from recurring,” the federation added.CNN has reached out to Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe for comment.Following the match, according to BBC Sport, Trabzonspor coach Abdullah Avci said, “We are going through a period that Turkish football is now completely fed by chaos, where tensions are constantly high, and where we cannot use the healing power of football.”While Fenerbahçe manager Ismail Kartal reportedly added, “I don’t understand why this place is so tense. Don’t we have the right to celebrate? We need to overcome these things. We need to be tolerant towards each other and have common sense.”This is the latest controversy to engulf Turkish football.In December, Faruk Koca, the president of top-flight Turkish soccer club Ankaragücü resigned, a day after he punched a FIFA-licensed referee in the face. Recently, there have been reports of several protests of referee-related decisions."

        "text": "Former Brazilian footballer Robson de Souza – also known as Robinho – was arrested by Federal Police on Thursday in Santos, in the Brazilian state of São Paulo, his lawyer told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil, as police cars were seen leaving his residence in Santos.The 40-year-old former AC Milan and Brazil striker faces nine years in prison after being convicted in Italy for gang raping a woman with five other men in 2013 after plying her with alcohol in a Milan nightclub.Robinho’s arrest comes as Brazil’s Supreme Court (STF) denied his appeal on Thursday to remain out of custody while all judicial appeals against his conviction are exhausted and ordered for the “immediate” start of his prison sentence, according to a statement from the STF.The footballer’s defense team had appealed to Brazilian authorities to allow Robinho to serve his jail time in Italy, rather than Brazil and to remain free while all appeal proceedings are ongoing, according to the STF decision.Robinho has always denied the charges.Following Thursday’s arrest Robinho is expected to face a custody hearing on Friday before being sent to a detention facility to being his prison sentence according to CNN Brasil.Robinho started his career at Brazilian club Santos before moving to Spanish giant Real Madrid in 2005 where he won two La Liga titles.He quickly gained a reputation as one of the best young players in the world and completed a high-profile move to Manchester City in 2008, before his form dipped and he spent the rest of his career at various clubs around the world.The forward also played 100 times for Brazil, inspiring his country to victory at Copa América in 2007."

        "title": "Charles Barkley tears into Barack Obama’s March Madness bracket as fans bid to beat the near-impossible odds once again",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "It’s that time of year again, when anyone and everyone turns into a college basketball expert.It’s one of the few things in sport that has never been done before, but that doesn’t stop fans from across the world attempting to successfully complete their perfect March Madness bracket every year.The task is simple, yet almost impossible. All you have to do is successfully predict every result in all 63 games up until a national champion is crowned.Barack Obama is one of millions to perennially try his luck at history every year, but it seems even the former US president’s picks aren’t above ridicule, as NBA legend and CNN host Charles Barkley ripped into his bracket attempt.“He went with the traditional pick, everyone is picking UConn […] so he’s just copying off someone else’s paper,” said Barkley, when analyzing Obama’s men’s bracket on CNN show “King Charles.”The 11-time NBA All-Star wasn’t any more impressed with Obama’s attempt for the women’s bracket: “See, he just went chalk. He picked South Carolina because everybody in the world picks South Carolina.”Barkley also had a message for those trying to become the first person in history to get it right.“I only fill out one. All those other fools be filling out like five. That’s one of the 10 commandments: you only get one bracket. One bracket, fools,” he laughed.A bracket is a way of referring to the 64-team format which plots the route of each team if they were win their matches. After teams are seeded, they are split into four regional groups (East, South, West and Midwest) and scheduled against teams at the other end of seeding scale. For example, the first seed faces the 16th seed and the second faces the 15th and so on.Following the opening round – colloquially called the “First Four,” which sees four teams exit – the remaining 64 teams play single-elimination games in neutral venues to eventually crown the national champion.Truth is, whether you’ve been an avid college basketball watcher all season or you just pick the teams based on the colors they wear, it doesn’t really matter.Due to the number of upsets and “Cinderella” stories March Madness tends to throw up, it has proven an impossible feat so far: the odds of getting every result correct are an extraordinary one to nine quintillion.As explained to CNN Sport in 2023 by Tim Chartier – distinguished visiting professor at the US National Museum of Mathematics and Joseph R. Morton professor of mathematics and computer science at Davidson College – nine quintillion is a nine followed by 18 zeroes.Chartier helped put that into context: “I’m going to pick one second in 292 billion years, and your job is to tell me which second I pick.”If you’re struggling with the raw numbers, Chartier suggests a physical representation of the nine quintillion to help. He says that the height of nine quintillion dollar bills stacked on top of one another is equivalent to the distance of going from Earth to Pluto over 60 times.Chartier outlines that after running some calculations himself, he came up with some probabilities which help better put it into perspective.“So you have better odds of winning the Powerball with two consecutive tickets than getting a perfect bracket,” he said. “You’ve better odds that a family of four will all get hit by lightning in their lifetime than picking a perfect bracket.“There is a stat out there that there’s a one in 10,000 chance that you get injured by a toilet. So there are better odds that that same family of four all get injured by the toilet than picking a perfect bracket.”The longest streak of correct predictions came in 2019 by a neuropsychologist from Ohio who managed to pick the winner in the first 49 games of March Madness that year correctly.Gregg Nigl became the first person to have a verified bracket which picked every game correctly through the tournament into the Sweet 16, only falling in the 50th game when No. 2 seed Tennessee lost to No. 3 seed Purdue in overtime.But don’t fear, there is hope – apparently.Chartier believes the near impossible feat will be achieved one day but does admit that it may take a while.And when it does happen, Chartier – who spends much of his time researching the art of bracketology and teaching people how to implement his research into March Madness brackets – believes it will be done by someone who knows “nothing about basketball.”“That’s because, a lot of times, you’re trying to predict literally the unpredictable, is that you’re trying to predict randomness, that there are certain games that that outcome is relatively random,” he said.“Some of it isn’t. Sometimes, there’s something about a team that we just didn’t realize, it was the perfect match-up for another team.”Despite the insane number of possibilities, there do seem to be trends forming from people’s picks this year.CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten says 25% of people have picked No. 1 seed UConn to win the men’s tournament, while 46.1% of picks predict NC State will be the biggest first-round upset.The issue is, the nation doesn’t have great form.Enten adds that the most popular No. 1 pick since 2014 was Kentucky in 2015. But, despite all the expectation, Kentucky didn’t even make the final that year. Also, in 2014, only 0.23% of people predicted UConn would win the men’s tournament.But, in truth – maybe – that’s the beauty of it.March Madness is as unpredictable as it is exciting and fans across the world will be watching once again, hoping that this is the year when someone, somewhere, does the nigh-impossible."

        "title": "‘Better together:’ How friendship and faith helped guide these two US marathon runners to Paris 2024",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "In many ways, Conner Mantz and Clayton Young are typical friends.They have known each other for years, live just a short drive from each other in Utah and spend a lot of time together. Mantz and his wife have occasionally stepped in for baby-sitting duties and Young once helped paint his friend’s house.But this friendship has an added level of complexity – Mantz and Young are two of the best marathon runners in the US and race against one another.After meeting at college in 2017, the duo have been on a near-seven-year mission to represent their country at the Olympic Games.During an emotional Olympic trials race in February, they worked together to make that ambition a reality.The pair finished first and second at the Florida event to stamp their tickets to Paris 2024. Young, who had looked the fresher of the two on the final stretch, seemingly gave up his lead to Mantz as the pair were separated by just one second, both achieving a life-long dream in the process.“Not a day goes by when I’m not having this conversation about the Olympics and the Olympic trials,” Young, 30, tells CNN Sport in a joint-interview with Mantz.“There’s this wave of emotion that comes over you and you’re like, ‘Oh yeah, that’s right. I did make the Olympic team. I’m an Olympian.’”Mantz says the achievement has taken a while to settle in but has slowly become more “normal” now that the training partners have started their preparations for Paris 2024.“It’s kind of unbelievable because you never know who’s going to be good,” the 27-year-old Mantz, who is three years younger than his friend, tells CNN Sport when reflecting on what they achieved at the Olympic trials.“Yes, we were the number one and number two seeds heading into the [race], but in athletics, everything is a lot more complicated than that. You can be the number one seed and you not make the final [selection].“So it was just special that it happened together. We’ve trained together for almost seven years and we’ve actually had our goals and dreams accomplished.”The pair estimate they’ve run well over 10,000 miles together over the years, since meeting at Brigham Young University (BYU) in 2017.Both agree that experiencing that same journey has offered each of them a deeper level of support, be it on a physical or mental level.“We’re able to learn from one another when we’re not running, and then when we are running, we’re able to push each other,” says Mantz, whose personal best for the marathon is two hours, seven minutes and 47 seconds.Young agrees, adding: “I think about standing on the starting line in Paris. I’m going to be standing next to [Mantz] again and just having the confidence that I’ve trained with one of the best athletes in the world, will give me a lot of confidence knowing that I belong.“If I can stick with him in practice, I can stick with him, hopefully, in Paris. That gives me a lot of confidence.”Make no mistake, though, both these men are fiercely competitive and are aware there might come a time where they have to put their friendship aside in order to claim personal glory – and for their country.If they have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship over almost seven years of training together, the two friends are honest enough to admit the occasional tension during workouts.“It’s definitely a dance that we have to play, and we just have to keep reminding ourselves that we’re better together,” says Young, who boasts a marathon personal best of two hours and eight minutes.“We are very competitive and we want to beat each other at the end of the day. But, ultimately, I have decided to fully embrace this relationship and I know that I will just be better because of it.”As well as a love for running, both men also share a joint faith, which they credit for helping them achieve so much in track and field.Both are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints – the largest Mormon denomination – and each served missions before meeting at college.Mantz served a mission in Ghana, while Young spent two years on a mission in North Carolina. The latter says his faith has helped ease the “daunting” pressures of racing on a global stage.“If my only identity is as a runner or making this Olympic team, it can be very debilitating,” he says, with Mantz nodding along in agreement.“Through our canonized faith, we’ve realized that we’re more than just a couple of runners, we’re more than just professional athletes. We’re husbands, I’m a father, and we’re ultimately sons of God.“It definitely has contributed to our running because that eternal perspective is really what grounds us. Racing is important and making an Olympic team is obviously a once in a lifetime thing, but there is more to this life than running.”With Paris 2024 fast approaching, both men are building up their preparations ahead of this year’s Olympics.Young is excited to compete at the upcoming NYC Half on March 17, a half-marathon event organized by New York Road Runners.More than 25,000 runners participate in the event, which goes from Brooklyn to Manhattan and ends in Central Park, with the race the only time other than New Year’s Eve that Times Square is closed to traffic.It will be another opportunity for Young to compete with other elite athletes before he races for medals at the Olympic Games.Mantz, meanwhile, has picked up a minor injury in recent days and had to drop out of the half-marathon race. The setback is not expected to impact his participation at Paris 2024 though.Neither is afraid to admit that a podium place in Paris is the goal, but both are acutely aware of how unpredictable an Olympic marathon can be.“I’d be lying if I said that [Young] and I don’t have it in the back of our minds that we’re wanting to go and get a medal. Whether that’s public or not, it shouldn’t matter,” Mantz says.Young agrees, saying: “I’m going to put myself in the best position possible and see what happens.”The 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games are set to begin on July 26, with the men’s marathon scheduled for August 10."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Real Madrid says it has filed a complaint against the referee who took charge of the team’s recent 4-2 La Liga win at Osasuna for “the negligent drafting” of his report about the match following the abuse aimed at star player Vinícius Jr. by supporters.The Spanish giant said that referee Juan Martínez Munuera “deliberately omitted the insults and humiliating shouts repeatedly directed towards our player … despite being warned insistently by our players at the same time they were occurring.”In one video aired on Spanish TV and shared on social media, chants of “die Vinícius, die” can clearly be heard in the stadium, leading Real captain Dani Carvajal to turn to the referee and point to his ear in an apparent attempt to make Martínez Munuera aware of the abuse.Real says it has filed the complaint to the Disciplinary Committee of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF).“Additionally, Real Madrid has also filed a complaint with this federative body in relation to the aforementioned insults and humiliating chants, and has forwarded them to the State Commission against Violence, Racism, Xenophobia and Intolerance in the Sports, so that those fans who uttered them are identified and punished,” the club added.CNN has reached out to RFEF, La Liga, Spain’s High Council of Sport (CSD) and both the federal prosecutor and local prosecutor in Pamplona, where Osasuna’s El Sadar stadium is based, for comment.On Tuesday, the RFEF’s Technical Committee of Referees (CTA) said in a statement that it “wants to express its total and unconditional support” to Munuera against “the unfair accusations made by Real Madrid.”The CTA added that, after reviewing audio from the match, no claims by Real Madrid players towards the referee regarding the abuse could be heard.“The referees are the main recipients of the verbal and physical violence that occurs on all football fields and, therefore, the most interested in expelling it from football,” the statement said.In a statement on Tuesday, Osasuna said it wanted “to show its rejection of the insults — which had no racist references — that a minority proffered last Saturday at El Sadar.“Osasuna continues its mission to raise awareness and eradicate, however minor, any behavior that does not conform to the values of sport.”Real says it has now expanded the complaint against “hate crimes and discrimination” it made on February 15 to Spain’s federal prosecutor following “racist and hateful insults” aimed at Vinícius during matches at Barcelona’s Montjuïc stadium and Atlético Madrid’s Metropolitano Stadium.“Real Madrid once again condemns these violent attacks of racism, discrimination and hatred, and demands that the necessary measures be taken, once and for all, in order to eradicate the violence that our player Vinícius Junior has been suffering,” the club said.It is just the latest in a long list of incidents of abuse aimed at Vinícius during matches in Spain over the past two seasons.On X, formerly known as Twitter, the Brazilian replied to a video of Atlético fans allegedly chanting racist slurs about Vinícius outside of the Metropolitano Stadium prior to the team’s Champions League match against Inter Milan in Madrid on March 13, saying: “I hope you have already thought of their punishment, [Champions League and UEFA] it’s a sad reality that this happens even at games where I’m not present!”Also, earlier this month, La Liga said it was “studying and analyzing the facts” around alleged racist abuse aimed at Vinícius at Valencia’s Mestalla Stadium on March 2.It came after a video obtained by ESPN and widely circulated online shows a child yelling “monkey” in Spanish allegedly towards the Brazilian forward, Anna Anjos – who shot the video – told ESPN after the match.Valencia’s local prosecutor told CNN at the time that “there are no open investigation proceedings” regarding the incident.La Liga – Spain’s top football division – told CNN in 2023 that it does not have the authority to punish clubs or fans for incidents of racist abuse.Instead, it can only pass on any incidents of abuse to RFEF committees or regional prosecutors, who deal with them as legal cases before sporting punishments are handed out.In late May 2023, Spanish police said seven people had been detained in relation to incidents of racist abuse directed at Vinícius.Four young men had been detained for allegedly hanging an effigy of Vinícius off a bridge in Madrid in January, while three others were arrested on suspicion of being involved in racist insults aimed at the Brazilian on May 21 of the same year.Last month, FIFA president Gianni Infantino called for automatic forfeits for teams whose fans have committed racism and caused matches to be abandoned.However, the English Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) chair says fellow players don’t believe enough is being done to punish racism at soccer matches."

        "title": "‘Breaking has total freedom for me,’ says Menno van Gorp, a medal hopeful in the newest Olympic sport",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "To the tune of a Miles Davis trumpet solo, Menno van Gorp is stepping up his training ahead of this year’s Paris Olympics.The jazz musician has been an influential figure in van Gorp’s breakdance career, his smooth sound and freewheeling rhythms a constant source of inspiration for each new routine.“I love to practice on jazz,” van Gorp tells CNN Sport. “It gives me more freedom and it just triggers more creativity when I move to jazz. Also, the part of improvisation in jazz is huge. I think that really reflects well with breaking.”The 35-year-old van Gorp, a competitive b-boy from the Netherlands known simply as Menno, is a medal hopeful at the upcoming Olympics, where breakdance – or breaking – will make its debut as the Games’ newest sport.Suddenly seeing their discipline labeled as a sport isn’t something that necessarily sits comfortably with b-boys and b-girls – the name given to men and women who compete in breaking.It has some similarities with pre-existing Olympic events like martial arts, gymnastics, and skateboarding, but will also bring its own subversive identity to this year’s Games.“We’re under the flag of sports now, but to me, it’s still also an art,” says van Gorp, who calls himself an “artlete” on social media. “I think breaking is so unique that it’s impossible to put it in one box … It’s many things together, and it’s also an expression.”A high-scoring breakdance routine requires a unique blend of strength, stamina, agility, and flexibility, as well as the mental wherewithal to ensure that moves aren’t repeated and flow seamlessly into each other.“You use literally every part of your body,” says van Gorp, “including your ears and your brains and your heart and your toes and your heels … I use my fingertips; I use the point of my elbow – every part in your body that you can use.“It takes a lot of physical abilities, I think, to be a good breaker.”Van Gorp practiced judo before he took up breaking, which found a foothold in his hometown of Tilburg during the 1990s.“First everybody was collecting Pokémon cards, then everybody was yo-yoing,” he says. “Suddenly, everybody started breaking.”After eight years of judo, he had started to find the sport too restrictive, the scope for creativity too narrow.“Breaking gave me so much freedom compared to judo,” van Gorp adds. “Breaking has total freedom for me, so that’s why I really liked it. In other sports, you’re always limited by a lot of rules.”Originating in New York in the late 1960s, breaking has since gained global popularity and today is synonymous with a specific subgenre of street style – sneakers, sweatpants, and baseball caps worn at an angle.Van Gorp, like many kids discovering breakdance for the first time in the early 2000s, gained insight from watching grainy videos and talking through routines with his friends before joining practices around the Netherlands and overseas.It was in winning the UK championships in 2007 that van Gorp says he “exploded onto the scene” and started to compete more regularly.He has gone on to win titles all over the world, including at the 2019 WDSF World Breaking Championship and three victories at the Red Bull BC One World Finals – a feat only matched by South Korean b-boy Hong 10.Breaking is the first World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) event to be added to the Olympic program, and in Paris, 16 b-boys and 16 b-girls will face off in one-on-one battles set against a DJ’s hip-hop soundtrack.They take it in turns to perform a routine and are scored by a panel of judges based on six criteria: creativity, personality, technique, performativity, variety, and musicality.With the Olympics in mind, van Gorp is breaking for up to two and a half hours each day, plus gym sessions and calisthenics – body-weight strength training like push-ups and sit-ups – in pursuit of winning gold.Such an accolade, he says, would be a huge boost for his profile.“I’m building here a dance studio in Rotterdam and I’m working also on the new generation here,” van Gorp explains. “Getting a medal I think would be so helpful for my career after breaking to make stuff happen for the next generation – that type of stamp on your name.”On top of establishing his dance school, van Gorp is also an amateur photographer; he paints – typically large canvasses streaked in brightly-colored lines – has his own clothes brand and is a father of two.His life, therefore, is a juggling act while training for the Olympics, which is all-consuming at the moment. In order to qualify for the Games, van Gorp will hope to earn selection via the Olympic Qualifier Series in May and June.Like every breaking competition, that will test not only his movement and creativity in the heat of a battle but also his memory: originality is rewarded, and contestants are scored down for repeating moves between rounds.“It all comes down to preparation,” says van Gorp. “I study my material a lot. I’ve found memory hacks to remember my stuff, so I give names to my moves. I make rhymes, I connect them with moments in life. I connect them with music I like.“And I write stuff down, I try it, I read it back, I visualize, and you pick between competitions what material you have left. And then in the battle it should all just fall in place.”Van Gorp compares himself to a “cage fighter” in the middle of a battle – “I really need to have that fire … it’s not about being a nice guy anymore,” he says – and believes that he thrives on being spontaneous and unpredictable during competitions.“A lot of unexpected movements, a lot of creativity,” he identifies as features of his routines. “My style is definitely based on flow and transitions, and I think you need to have a very well-trained eye to understand what I’m really doing.“If you blink one time or if you look away, you might have missed an important detail.”Having a unique style can be key in breaking, as it is with any form of art or music. It’s something that has drawn van Gorp to Miles Davis in particular.“To see how many times he reinvented himself and he still stayed authentic to himself, that’s a huge inspiration for me,” he says.Few other, if any, athletes will be honing their craft to the emotive sounds of jazz music ahead of this year’s Olympics, but that’s part of what makes breaking such an intriguing addition.“If you want to make art,” says van Gorp, “you want to make something that’s really you – not somebody else.”"

        "title": "Conor McGregor: How MMA star became a figurehead for the far-right in Ireland",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "“Ireland, we are at war,” UFC star Conor McGregor declared to his millions of social media followers on November 22, 2023.It’s not clear precisely what McGregor was referring to, but this post, was viewed more than 19 million times on X, formerly known as Twitter. It was later followed by a series of tweets about immigration which were then circulated amongst Telegram channels, seen by CNN to have links to the far-right.As far back as 2022, McGregor had expressed his support for people protesting against immigration.The day after McGregor’s war tweet, a stabbing outside a school in central Dublin left three children and an adult injured. Hours later, rioters with links to the far-right descended on the city.While local media later reported the alleged attacker was a naturalized Irish citizen who came to Ireland from Algeria in 2003, misinformation alleging the assailant was a foreign national had quickly spread online.Ciarán O’Connor, a senior analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that researches online hate and disinformation, told CNN that the far-right has grown in Ireland because of social media platforms such as X and Telegram which are commonly used by extremists.“The far-right are promoting McGregor as the voice of the people, taking advantage of his platforms to boost their ideology,” O’Connor told CNN, adding that he believes McGregor’s “tweets in the lead up to the riot were a call to action against illegal immigration.”The Telegram channels that had circulated McGregor’s declaration of war the night before the stabbing claimed asylum seekers posed an innate, existential threat to Ireland’s citizens.According to the Irish government, around 500 rioters spilled into the streets of Dublin and the rampage quickly turned violent. Police cars, buses and trams were set on fire. Rioters threw fireworks, flares and bottles injuring police officers, while shops were looted causing “tens of millions” of euros in damage.One protester could be seen on video holding a sign reading “Irish Lives Matter,” while others were heard chanting anti-immigrant slogans, as “get them out” reverberated around the nation’s capital in a night of violence.Paul Murphy, a TD – a member of the Irish parliament – from the People Before Profit party, who has had members of the far-right protest outside his home in Dublin for his outspoken support of refugees, told CNN that “in terms of active members of the far-right, there’s between 200 to 300 between all far-right organizations: national, freedom party, Ireland first – form a multitude of micro far-right parties.”Despite Ireland’s two far-right parties, the Irish National Party and the Irish Freedom Party, respectively received around 0.2% and 0.3% of the vote in the 2020 general election, Murphy said the far-right are a small but growing minority.This comes after the Garda – as Ireland’s police are known – told CNN there were 231 anti-immigration related public gatherings in 2023.After the riot on November 23, 2023, police commissioner Drew Harris said, “What is clear is that people have been radicalized through social media,” before describing rioters as “a complete lunatic hooligan faction driven by far-right ideology.”As riots raged in Dublin, McGregor, posted on X, “You reap what you sow.”Local media reported this triggered a police investigation into the UFC star and others for allegedly “inciting hatred online.” The Garda told CNN that they would not comment on McGregor’s case.McGregor also took to social media to suggest that he might run for [Irish] President. The seriousness of his online claim remains unclear, though in a subsequent post McGregor positioned himself as providing “fresh skin in the game.”“These parties govern themselves vs govern the people … I listen. I support. I adapt. I have no affiliation/bias/favoritism toward any party. They would genuinely be held to account regarding the current sway of public feeling … It would not be me in power as President, people of Ireland. It would be me and you,” said McGregor.McGregor did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. However, following the Dublin riot the 35-year-old told the Guardian in a statement that, “We Irish are known for our beautiful hearts, and we have a proud history of not accepting racism.”The rise of McGregor is one of the most famous rags-to-riches stories in sports.A working-class boy from Dublin, McGregor was driven by a desire to become world champion in a sport relatively unknown in Ireland.As he started winning fights, the MMA octagon became McGregor’s colosseum. He entertained spectators with his precise boxing style and his quick wit charmed an ever-growing fan base.“The Notorious” Conor McGregor brand was born and, before long, he was the first person in history to hold two UFC belts simultaneously, rising to become the world’s highest paid sport star in 2021, according to Forbes.Yet McGregor was dogged by accusations of sexual assault, which he has denied, while a string of defeats to Khabib Nurmagomedov, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Dustin Poirier left the fighter with one title victory in the last eight years.With his fighting career in flux, McGregor has turned his attention to sparring with people on social media, which has touched a nerve in Ireland’s political establishment.Political analysts and far-right experts have told CNN that McGregor’s unique brand of Irish patriotism that won him supporters as a fighter has mutated into a strand of “far-right” Irish nationalism.“Far-right figures who do promote ethnonationalism – of Ireland for the Irish – celebrate when McGregor is becoming more aligned with their brand of nationalism,” O’Connor said.McGregor has become “a vocal anti-immigration influencer and is using his enormous reach and influence to encourage hostility and suspicion of migrants and asylum seekers,” he added.McGregor has been accused by some Irish politicians of fanning the flames of discontent online, voicing his anger at Ireland’s immigration policy and asking questions that strike at the core of Irish consciousness: does Ireland, a country with its long history of emigration, remain a country that welcomes people seeking refuge?“I think these tweets are incredibly irresponsible for someone who has ten million followers on Twitter alone to be whipping up this level of poison and hate,” Labour Justice spokesperson Aodhán Ó Ríordáin told RTÉ News last year. McGregor has said he’s being made a “scapegoat.”The former UFC champion appears to have picked his corner, in the fight for Ireland’s soul, but whether he is willingly or unwillingly platforming “far-right” views remains unclear.“When he first came to prominence in 2012, he got attention by acting like a clown – and people received him well,” Ewan MacKenna, who authored the book “Chaos is a Friend of Mine: The Life and Crimes of Conor McGregor,” told CNN.“He will become whatever the crowd wants him to be and he molds himself into whatever brings him the most attention, and with politics, it would be similar.”McGregor has previously claimed he regularly deletes his posts on X for “personal” reasons but has also said: “My statements, widely publicised, stand.”McGregor’s UFC slogan was once: “When one of us go to war, we all go to war,” and the MMA fighter has continued to evoke war imagery in recent months.“McGregor, when he first came onto the [MMA] scene, he used his sense of Irishness to portray an image of a fighting Irish warrior, but in the last couple of months, he has pivoted this towards ethno-nationalism and this idea that Ireland must protect itself from refugees,” said O’Connor.In a later post, now deleted by McGregor, the fighter reacted to footage of a bus of asylum seekers, writing: “People of the community are not told who these men are. Or why they are here. This is what I mean when I say we are at war. You cannot expect the people of Ireland to tolerate this. We will not.”In a separate, now deleted post on X, the UFC star said: “Do not let any Irish property be took over unannounced. Evaporate said property. It’s a war.”Since November 2018 , there have been a number of instances when properties or locations linked, to the housing of people seeking asylum or international protection were set on fire, according to analysis by Irish media.The UFC star, in a now deleted post, said: “I stand with the people of the East Wall,” in reference to protests which started in Dublin’s East Wall district in November 2022 over plans to house refugees in a disused office block. McGregor’s tweet was then circulated widely in Telegram channels with links to the far-right.Ireland, a country of just over five million people, saw 141,600 immigrants arrive on its shores in the year leading up to April 2023 – the highest figure in 16 years with some attracted by its strong economic performance (9.4% real GDP growth in 2022), according to the Central Statistics Office Ireland (CSO).In 2020, Ireland was ranked in the Migration Policy Index’s top 10 of countries for having “a comprehensive approach to integration, which fully guarantees equal rights, opportunities and security for immigrants and citizens.”But for many ordinary workers, the benefits are failing to reach their pockets and they struggle are struggling to afford high housing prices and rents.This leaves many without a stake in society, or a home to live in, and so Ireland is often seen as a nation of exiles, with more than 64,000 people leaving its shores to try their hand at a life elsewhere over the same time period.Matthew Donoghue, a professor in social policy at University College Dublin, told CNN socio-economic inequality can create a “sense of insecurity that the far-right have become adept at exploiting for their own gain, scapegoating people and groups who are facing exactly the same pressures.”“The pressures people feel can be a result of complex political, economic and social factors but instead the far-right offer a simple - but incorrect - narrative of blame,” he added.In November, McGregor shared, before unsharing, an X post by anti-immigration Irish influencer Mick O’Keefe about residents in rural Ireland putting up a checkpoint to deter asylum seekers from entering local areas.O’Keefe regularly writes to McGregor on X, calling him “President McGregor.” O’Keefe did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.AI-generated images of McGregor have also circulated online, showing him bare-chested, holding a rifle and leading a mob of armed Irishmen.In one video posted on X, Keith Woods, an Irish anti-immigration influencer, lambasts Ireland’s new hate speech laws, claiming they are a way to silence people speaking out against immigration.The same video then shows an AI-generated image of McGregor wearing a crown on his head, wrapped in an Irish tricolor.Woods has appeared on far-right agitator Nick Fuentes’ “America First” show. During a separate show, Fuentes – an American White nationalist and Holocaust denier – said that McGregor should “rise up” and “salvage [Ireland] because it’s going to be either the Irish or it’s going to be the Blacks,” before adding: “Only one side is going to come out of this thing alive.”McGregor, who follows Woods on X, has liked his posts in the past, including one where Woods quoted Irish 1916 patriot Padraig Pearse saying, “Ireland belongs to the Irish.”The phrase has become the new slogan of the far-right Irish National Party, for which Woods has been seen canvassing and holding the party’s banner.Woods did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.As recently as 2019, Foreign Policy said that Ireland was one of Europe’s “last countries without extreme nationalists in parliament.”But the Dublin riots and subsequent protests have cast the spotlight on the emergence of a new right-wing strain of politics and its amplification on social media.Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, told CNN that “far-right groups in Ireland are harnessing Twitter (now known as X) to spread their messages in the same way far-right groups do so in other parts of the EU.”But she added: “It is true that Ireland’s far right is less developed than in places like Germany and France, where there are rising political parties of this persuasion, or in Italy, Sweden, and other countries where the far right is part of the governing majority.”Donoghue added, “there is a larger (yet small) base of committed activists using social media, especially that they are able to organize more effectively than before. However, it is very important to note that they are roundly rejected by the vast majority of the Irish population.”"

        "title": "Tapas, ribeye steak and puff pastry cake: Jon Rahm injects Basque flair into Masters champions menu",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Jon Rahm will be taking fellow green jacket winners on a culinary trip to the Basque Country when he hosts his Masters Champions Dinner next month.Tuesday saw the Spaniard give an extensive rundown of his carefully curated menu for the prestigious banquet at Augusta National’s clubhouse on April 9, an annual tradition – kickstarted by Ben Hogan in 1952 – staged on the eve of the major where the reigning victor decides what will be served to a table of previous champions.Crafted with the help of Spanish chef and restaurateur José Andrés, Rahm’s menu is a love letter to the Basque territories in the north of his country. Born in Barrika, a town north of Bilbao in the region’s Biscay province, the world No. 3 is hoping his home flavors will win over his fellow winners.“I wanted to put a little bit of my essence into it, and I’m hoping they really like it,” Rahm told reporters in a Tuesday press conference.“It should be quite special, and they’re going to try a few things that they maybe haven’t seen before that are really quite tasty.”Rahm has pedigree on his side. Spain boasted more of the world’s 50 best-ranked restaurants than any other country in 2023 with six. Half of those – No. 4, 22 and 31 – can be found in Basque Country, a region that punches well above its weight in culinary excellence.Despite a population of just under 2.2 million people, according to the Basque Statistics Office, the region is home to 23 Michelin star restaurants, including four with three stars.Teeing off proceedings are pintxos – the Basque’s answer to tapas. The small plates range from meats – Iberian ham (jamón), cured pork loin (lomo) and spicy Basque chorizo (chistorra) wrapped in potato – to a local Idiázabal cheese with black truffle, creamy chicken croquettes (croquetas) and a traditional Spanish potato omelette (tortilla).Then there’s “Mama Rahm’s” lentil stew (lentejas) – a recipe passed over to Andrés by its original creator, Rahm’s grandmother.“If somebody doesn’t like it, please just don’t tell me,” Rahm said. “Don’t tell anyone actually. It means a little bit too much to me to hear it.”The main course sees a Basque crab salad served with one of two options; turbot fish (rodaballo) with white asparagus, or Basque ribeye steak (chuletón) accompanied by lettuce and piquillo peppers.The latter, typically smoked and seared before being served to guests to cook to their preference, is Rahm’s favorite – just don’t sear your steak beyond medium rare when he or other Basque natives at the table.“If you go past that, you’re going to get a weird look just because that’s how we are,” Rahm said. “Very proud people of what we do, and meat usually is high quality.“Every time I go back home, I try to eat it.”Dessert is a puff pastry cake known locally as milhojas, which translates to “1,000 leaves”, served up with custard and Chantilly cream.Rounding up offerings are the wine pairings, a dry Basque white called Txakoli and CVNE Imperial – a bottle of which Rahm has displayed proudly in his home office – a red from Rioja.The bottle in Rahm’s office was among his grandfather’s “prized possessions” and was when the winery released a special edition collaboration of the wine with his beloved Athletic Bilbao soccer team in 1994, the year Rahm was born.The wine was his grandfather’s favorite and it’s “very high quality” Rahm insisted, and it will be called upon to help him navigate his dinner speech jitters.“When I tell you that this has definitely been rent free in my head,” Rahm admitted.“I usually have no issues public speaking – I’ll get up there and talk about anything. [But] Just the image of standing up and having everybody in that room look at me and having to speak to all these great champions, it’s quite daunting.“I think I’m just going to speak from the heart, and that’s usually what delivers the better speech … I don’t know exactly what I’m going to say, but hopefully, one or two glasses of wine help me get a little bit more fluid.”Last year’s host Scottie Scheffler will be among those tuning in to Rahm’s toast – and enjoying his Iberian feast.Having ushered in the tournament last year by serving up his Texas-inspired menu – featuring cheeseburger sliders, ribeye steak with mac & cheese, and chocolate chip skillet cookies – the American world No. 1 ended it by presenting Rahm with his green jacket.Rahm had surged clear of Scheffler to win by five strokes ahead of Brooks Koepka and Phil Mickelson – both of whom are now the Spaniard’s fellow competitors in LIV Golf following his departure from the PGA Tour in December.With the proposed reconciliation agreement between the warring tours yet to be finalized, Rahm’s switch to the Saudi-backed circuit meant he had to settle for a sofa view of Scheffler edging Wyndham Clark to clinch an unprecedented title defense at The Players Championship, the PGA Tour’s flagship event, on Sunday.“What an accomplishment, to be the first ever back-to-back champion with pretty much every great golfer in the history of this game having played that tournament at that golf course,” Rahm said.“It was fun to watch, and what a finish. Jesus Christ, that was one that was fun to watch. I feel for Wyndham [Clark] because to come back and play the last three holes the way he did and have that lip-out, it’s gut-wrenching to watch. But it made for great TV, and it was really fun.”Rahm, who is chasing his first win after four tournaments on the Saudi-backed circuit, admitted The Players is one of several PGA Tour events he will miss competing at, but is optimistic that there is “room for all” in golf’s future after years of internal conflict.“I just want to be able to see the best in the world compete against the best in the world, whatever that looks like,” Rahm said.“I think there’s room for all of us, and there’s room for the game of golf to get to the next level and have more viewership options.“I think I’ve said before, when it comes to football, for example, or soccer, you have the Premier League, you have the Spanish League, you have the Bundesliga, Serie A, you have the French league, and also on top of that you have the main two European events, right, the Champions League and the Europa Cup [League], and everybody watches all of those no matter what team they support.“So I think there is a way of having golf deliver and be able to put out a different product that’s better for everybody, not me or for players but for spectators in general.”"

        "title": "Allegations around Dodger Shohei Ohtani’s interpreter spur MLB investigation amid IRS probe. Here’s the latest",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Major League Baseball and the Internal Revenue Service are investigating amid allegations surrounding Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani and his longtime interpreter Ippei Mizuhara.The investigations are underway just two days after Mizuhara, a longtime interpreter for the Japanese baseball superstar, was fired after the player’s lawyers accused him of “massive theft” of millions of dollars and placing bets with a bookmaker under federal investigation, according to ESPN and the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the story.“Major League Baseball has been gathering information since we learned about the allegations involving Shohei Ohtani and Ippei Mizuhari from the news media,” the league said in a news release. “Earlier today, our Department of Investigations (DOI) began their formal process investigating the matter.”The IRS Criminal Investigation Los Angeles Field Office is investigating both Mizuhara and Mathew Bowyer, IRS spokesman Scott Villiard told CNN on Friday. Bowyer is a California resident whose bankruptcy court documents show had gambling debts of $425,000 more than a decade ago. Diane Bass, an attorney for Bowyer, told CNN her client “never had any contact with Mr. Ohtani.”Ohtani’s attorneys have not detailed how they believe the funds were stolen, fueling questions about the scandal that emerged as Ohtani made his much-anticipated debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers.The saga began with reporters asking questions about alleged wire transfers from Ohtani’s bank account and culminated in Mizuhara’s firing. Here’s how the scandal unfolded:• Mizuhara told ESPN in a Tuesday interview arranged by Ohtani’s representative that Ohtani had no involvement in his betting and that Mizuhara asked the player last year to pay off his gambling debt, ESPN reported.• But after the interview, Ohtani’s spokesperson “disavowed” Mizuhara’s account, then released a statement saying Ohtani had been the victim of theft.• On the same day, Mizuhara was seen smiling in the LA dugout and talking to Ohtani before translating for the star in the team’s 5-2 win over the San Diego Padres in the MLB season-opening game in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday.• Later on Wednesday, Mizuhara was fired as Ohtani’s interpreter. The pair had been working together since 2013.• After learning about the allegations against Ohtani and Mizuhara, MLB announced it would be pursuing an investigation on Friday. The IRS also confirmed it was investigating the translator.ESPN’s Tisha Thompson, citing unnamed sources, said on CNN’s “The Lead” Wednesday at least $4.5 million was withdrawn via wire transfer from Ohtani’s bank accounts, though it is unclear who initiated the transfers.Thompson also reports sources told her Mizuhara’s sports betting dates back as early as 2021, when Ohtani was playing for the Los Angeles Angels.When reached for comment, the Angels referred all questions to the Dodgers and Shohei’s representatives.Ohtani played his last game with the Angels last year before signing a record-breaking 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers.The Dodgers confirmed Mizuhara’s firing and said they are “aware of media reports and are gathering information.” The team added it had no further comment.As news of Mizuhara’s firing and alleged actions unfolded, both the interpreter and Ohtani’s representatives have shifted their statements given to ESPN reporters – first saying the star player was aware of his translator’s gambling debt and later that he had no knowledge or involvement.ESPN’s Thompson said the interpreter and Ohtani’s representatives did “a big 180” in what they were telling her.At first, Ohtani’s spokesperson told ESPN the player had transferred money to help pay off Mizuhara’s gambling debts, the outlet reported. In a Tuesday interview with ESPN, the translator said Ohtani was unhappy with the situation but agreed to pay the debt.Mizuhara also said that he never bet on MLB games and denied Ohtani had any involvement.Then on Wednesday, Ohtani’s law firm, Berk Brettler LLP, released a statement saying, “In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft and we are turning the matter over to the authorities.”That same day, Mizuhara admitted lying about Ohtani being aware of his debts, Thompson said. He walked back much of his initial story, saying instead that Ohtani had no knowledge of the interpreter’s debts and had made no payments, ESPN reported.CNN has sought comment from Ohtani’s agent and further comment from the Dodgers. CNN has also sought comment from Mizuhara.Mizuhara apologized to the team after the Dodgers’ game in Seoul Wednesday, according to ESPN, citing an unnamed Dodgers official.“I’ve been told (Mizuhara) says something to the effect of ‘I’m sorry. I apologize. I have a gambling problem,’” Thompson said on ESPN.Ohtani and Mizuhara first worked together from 2013 to 2017 when Mizuhara served as a translator for the Nippon-Ham Fighters, Ohtani’s team with Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball League, according to MLB.com. When Ohtani joined the Los Angeles Angels in 2018, he asked Mizuhara to join him as his translator in the rookie season, and Mizuhara eventually followed the star to the Dodgers."

        "text": "After last year’s tournament gripped the nation, the women’s bracket of this year’s March Madness has a lot to live up to.The LSU Tigers are the reigning champions after defeating the Iowa Hawkeyes in a dramatic national championship game last season, winning the program’s first ever NCAA women’s basketball title.It was a game that pitted two stars, Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, against each other; a rivalry which sparked debate long after the final buzzer sounded.The pair are both back in action this year, and while Clark’s Iowa begin their campaign on Saturday, Reece is set for action on a blockbuster opening day.March Madness women’s games can be watched live across ABC and ESPN channels.The first game to tip-off in the women’s bracket will be between No. 8 seed North Carolina and No. 9 Michigan State at 11.30 a.m. E.T., with the game being shown on ESPN2.LSU (No. 3) vs. Rice (No. 14) – 4 p.m. ET on ESPNReese is one of the tournament’s biggest stars, following her crucial role in propelling LSU to its first ever women’s college basketball title last year.Although LSU earned a No. 3 seed on Selection Sunday after succumbing to defeat against South Carolina in the SEC Tournament championship game, it is still expected to be one of the top contenders to defend its title.Kim Mulkey’s squad has been playing some its best basketball heading into the tournament but will face a resolute Rice team hoping to become this year’s “Cinderella” story.South Carolina (No. 1) vs. Presbyterian (No. 16) – 2 p.m. ET on ESPNSouth Carolina is the most popular No. 1 pick among fans attempting to perfect their brackets this year.The women’s No. 1 overall seeds are coming off the back of a second consecutive SEC Tournament title and are seeking to become the tenth team in women’s Division I history to finish the season as undefeated champions.They will play against Presbyterian in the first round and should have enough to breeze through.However, last year, South Carolina went undefeated in the SEC regular season and SEC tournament before being upset by Iowa in the Final Four. So nothing should be taken for granted.Presbyterian won the program’s first ever NCAA tournament game over the Sacred Heart Pioneers to make it to the final 64 teams. Anything else will surely be a bonus.No. 4 Virginia Tech vs. No. 13 Marshall – 3:30 p.m. on ESPN2Looking for a first round upset? This could be it.The seeding here would suggest a first-round victory for Virginia Tech, but an injury to star player Elizabeth Kitley makes this a closer contest than first thought.The 6-foot-6 forward injured her knee on March 3 and announced Thursday she would miss the NCAA tournament.“This is not at all how I anticipated ending this year with my team, but I’m so proud of all of our accomplishments, and I’m excited to see my girls continue to compete,” the three-time ACC player of the year said on Instagram.Her absence offers No. 13 seed Marshall a chance to produce an upset.

        "text": "Another high seed has fallen in this year’s NCAA men’s basketball tournament.Kentucky, the No. 3 seed in the South Region, was stunned by No. 14 seed Oakland University 80-76 in the first round on Thursday at PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.The Golden Grizzlies were led by senior guard Jack Gohlke, who finished with 32 points. Gohlke’s 10 three-pointers are tied for the second most in an NCAA tournament game. The record was set by Jeff Fryer of Loyola Marymount in 1990 with 11.Oakland advances to the second round for the first time in the history of the southeastern Michigan school.Golden Grizzlies head coach Greg Kampe, who is in his 40th year coaching the program, nodded his head towards Gohlke when asked how they achieved this unlikely win.“This guy right here. He had no conscience,” Kampe told the CBS Sports broadcast. “We talked all week: ‘Just go shoot it, baby. You’re the best.’ And he’s the best, and he proved it to the world tonight.“I said this is what we wanted, this stage. We wanted Kentucky because they’re the best – they’re the best. So, we wanted that, and we wanted this stage and our kids came through.”Kampe added the team will enjoy “45 minutes of this” and then get ready for its next game.“We have a chance of a lifetime,” Kampe said. “This isn’t the end of it. … We’ve got more, and the only way we are going to win on Saturday is to stay focused and take it one at a time.”Gohlke was asked after the game his feelings on having a game any player would “dream of.”“It’s just something I’ve worked so hard for my whole career, and coach just instills the confidence in me – gives me the freedom to go out there and play and influence the game in a positive way,” Gohlke said. “I’m just having fun. We have tremendous crowd, tremendous stage. … It’s a dream. This is why players work so hard to get to this stage.”The Wildcats fell to 1-4 in the program’s last five NCAA tournament games. This is the second time in three years that the John Calipari-coached team has crashed out in the first round to a double-digit seed.“We are not a Cinderella,” Gohlke bluntly said before walking to the locker room with his coach.Oakland will face the winner of 6-seed Texas Tech and 11-seed North Carolina State on Saturday."

        "title": "‘Relief from everyday life’: How soccer is helping Ukrainian soldiers who have lost limbs in the war against Russia",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Breathing heavily, Oleksandr Malchevsky puts on his prosthesis and hurries home to his wife and son. The 39-year-old has just lost a soccer game, but he isn’t too upset. For him, the sport is more than just a game – it’s about helping his rehabilitation as he adjusts to civilian life.Malchevsky is a Ukrainian soldier who lost part of his leg fighting in Eastern Ukraine. He voluntarily joined the army when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and served as a gunner. Last year in the Kharkiv region, he came under mortar fire and was seriously injured. The doctors saved his left leg but had to amputate part of his right limb.After a year of painful rehabilitation, Malchevsky returned to Kyiv – his native city – and joined the soccer team with other soldiers who had lost limbs fighting for Ukraine.“All my life, I played football in this stadium. When I returned with an injury from the frontline, I was unsure what to do. I joined the team, and I have to say that I’m happy. Here I get a moral relief from everyday life,” Malchevsky, who was discharged from the army for health reasons, told CNN Sport.Amputees, both civilians and soldiers, play football at the small Bannikov Stadium in the center of Kyiv every Thursday. The sessions normally run for two hours and allow the amputees to practice skills, perform strength and conditioning exercises and play games.The Ukrainian Football Federation organized this initiative a few months ago to support soldiers who lost limbs and help their rehabilitation and return to normal life. There are both men and women. Some of them were injured after the 2022 invasion, while others lost limbs following the start of the war in Ukraine in 2014.Reportedly over 20,000 Ukrainians have needed amputations since the war began in February 2022. The coach in charge of Thursday’s session is Dmytro Rzondkovsky. He says there are not many people playing at the moment, but he hopes more will come.“I think football provides psychological support, first of all,” Rzondkovsky, who is also the coach of the Ukrainian amputee football team, told CNN.“Here, these people find new friends and communication. I was really surprised by how much these people love life, football, and sports. This love of life is something I’m still learning from them.”Rzondkovsky is a professional football coach and has a UEFA B license qualification. UEFA is European soccer’s governing body.Even though Thursday’s session doesn’t involve professional players, this project is important for him. He sees the physical pain of the players but tries to support them by showing that they can be a big part of the sport.Some of these soldiers participated in the premier competitions of the League of Nations of the European Football Federation among teams formed from players with limb amputations.In October, the Ukrainian team took second place, defeating the national teams of Greece (2-1) and Belgium (1-0), and also shared points in goalless matches with the teams of Georgia and Israel.“I’m really proud to coach these people,” added Rzondkovsky. “I’m not only their coach. I’m their friend. We are joking a lot during the breaks. It’s a very good atmosphere here.“Thanks to football, they seem to come back to life after the war. In my opinion, rehabilitation through sport, through football, is the best, most effective rehabilitation that can exist.”There is plenty of humor and support among the amputees during the Thursday game that CNN watches.“It was harder on the frontline,” says 32-year-old Roman Lyndov, who plays as a goalkeeper at this game. He lost his left hand in February 2014 at the beginning of the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine, also known as Euromaidan, when something exploded near him.For Lyndov, spending evenings on the field is much better than lounging on the sofa. “This game is more about the character. We are here to win,” he says.Another player is 31-year-old veteran Olha Benda. The mother of two boys, Benda lost part of her left hand in 2017.She was the senior cook at the 72nd Mechanized Brigade. In 2017, with her unit, she was in positions in Avdiivka, eastern Ukraine.She was sleeping in her room when shelling started. When the first explosion happened, Benda fell out of bed. After the second explosion, she was stuck under the rubble and then passed out.There were about 10 Ukrainian soldiers at that location, but she was the only one who was seriously injured.It’s her first training session in Kyiv. Before this, she had been to Poland to watch women’s games and also train. She plans to join the Ukrainian women’s amputee soccer team, which is just being formed. She gets tired faster than the men but doesn’t stop playing, even when out of breath.“I don’t want to be last, I want to be on the same level as the men,” Beneda told CNN. “That’s why I don’t give up. I don’t want to sit in one place; I want to always be on the move and keep my body in good physical shape.“I need to set an example for my sons,” explains Beneda, adding that her nine-year-old son is waiting for her at home and keeps asking her when she is going to start playing soccer with him.Andriy, 42, is also at Thursday’s session. An infantryman, in charge of a rocket launcher, Andriy lost his left hand after being hit by a shell a few months ago in the Donetsk region.He recently was fitted with a prosthetic but is currently on sick leave and has medical boards ahead of him. In the meantime, he dreams about the possibility of peace.Malchevsky, who returned to the company where he had worked before the invasion as an electrical engineering analyst, says he plays not only for himself but also for his family.“I have to take care of myself. I don’t want to be pushed around in a wheelchair in five years. I don’t want to ruin the lives of my child, wife and parents,” he reflects."

His conviction comes against the backdrop of the Netherlands’ wider war on drugs.Earlier this month, Dutch prosecutors successfully argued that Promes was central to a drug trafficking operation involved in smuggling some 1,360 kilograms of cocaine from Brazil to the Netherlands through the port of Antwerp in Belgium in 2020, in two separate incidents.“It is particularly bad that the suspect [Promes] normalizes and almost romanticizes the large-scale cocaine trade,” said Dutch prosecutors.“The suspect profiles himself that way to the outside world, while he is an example for young people who look up to him,” the prosecutors added.Promes was convicted in absentia to six years in prison for drug trafficking. It’s a sentence he won’t serve any time soon given given he lives in Russia, playing for Russian Premier League side Spartak Moscow.“The suspect maintained a managerial role and was a financier. He worked calculatedly, was careful and did not take too many risks. He did not get his own hands dirty. He let others do the dirty work,” said prosecutors earlier this month in the case.Lawyers for Promes said he denied the charges, and would be appealing the sentence.“We will further explain our grievances to the Court of Appeal during a yet to be scheduled public hearing,” said Promes’ lawyers in a statement.“Finally, we would like to emphasize that as long as the judge’s verdict is not final, every suspect in the Netherlands must be presumed innocent. This also applies to Mr. Promes.”Last year, Promes was convicted in absentia for stabbing his cousin in the knee, Reuters reported, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison, according to prosecutors.Promes’ contract with Spartak Moscow runs until the end of June 2024, according to Transfermarkt. The Russian club did not respond to CNN’s request for comment as to whether it will continue to play Promes in matches or extend his contract.Criminologist Hans Nelen told CNN that Promes’ case is “remarkable … From the outside, many people are inclined to say: ‘He will earn millions of euros a year…. Why [is he] involved in the drug trade to begin with?’”A professor of criminology at Maastricht University, Nelen says the general public’s reaction to Promes’ situation was one of frustration.“That he’s out and he cannot be arrested and then he cannot be put in jail, and is still playing football,” he said.According to Nelen, Promes posting photos on social media in expensive cars, wearing diamond encrusted jewelry and on luxury holidays to destinations like Dubai, isn’t a great look with the Dutch public.“He’s still putting posts on social media, and he’s pretending that he is untouchable,” added Nelen.CNN has contacted representatives for Promes, offering the soccer player the opportunity to comment on his recent court case, but hadn’t received a reply at the time of publication.Earlier this year, Femke Halsema, the mayor of Amsterdam, warned that Rotterdam – Europe’s largest port – has become a “global transit hub for cocaine,” with more than 22,000 kg of the drug seized in the first half of 2022 compared with 29,702 kg in the first half of 2023 in spite of authorities’ efforts to take on trafficking. Dutch Customs seized almost 60,000 kg of cocaine in 2023, the Dutch government reported.Halsema, along with the mayor of Rotterdam, said that more must be done to address drug crime, warning in a 2022 letter to the House of Representatives of “a criminal culture of violence” gripping the country.The country’s Multidisciplinary Intervention Team was rebranded that same year as the National Alliance against Subversive Crime (NASC), with its mission “to expose and untangle the financial and other interconnectedness of the underworld and mainstream society,” according to the Dutch government.Concern over drug-related crime in the Netherlands has risen in recent years. In 2021, Dutch crime journalist Peter R. de Vries, known for his investigative work exposing the criminal underworld, was gunned down on a busy central Amsterdam street.“We cannot deny that the drug trade and drug trafficking in general has become a huge issue during the last decade,” said Nelen, though the criminologist adds that “when you think about employment between the drug economy and the legitimate economy, corruption and political influences, I would say that’s rather limited.”“It’s not such a case like Mexico or Columbia or to a certain extent Italy, that somehow our legitimate economy or political system has been completely infiltrated by criminals,” he explained.Still, the Netherlands is a key destination for drug traffickers because it is home to several large ports and borders Germany and Belgium, so it’s a “gateway to Europe,” according to Nelen.Though Promes’ conviction is certainly one of the highest-profile cases in the country in recent years, Nelen said that the Netherlands has seen other attention-grabbing cases of celebrities’ involvement in the illegal drugs trade, including martial arts professionals and kickboxers.Dutchman David Endt, who has worked as a journalist and with Dutch clubs in organizational roles and is now a soccer agent, told CNN that he knew a very different Promes in the early stages of his soccer career.“There was a very pleasant guy there, always – big laugh on his face, did nobody really any harm, and suddenly [he] came into a spiral and then it goes down and down,” said Endt, adding that he hasn’t had contact with Promes for more than 10 years.“The problem with being instantly famous … It’s hard to make the right choices with so-called friends, you attract a lot of people who have bad intentions,” added Endt.And Dutch soccer clubs seem to be taking notice.“Some football clubs are now aware of this and using retired police officers or other coaches to talk to kids who are already 14, 15, 16 years old, who are very talented, to warn them of some of the dangers and some of the risks that may come across. So there are indeed preventative measures taken by some of the clubs,” Nelen adds.Endt, who worked with Ajax in an organizational role for 20 years, told CNN: “After some incidents, smaller ones, bigger ones, we got help from police officers, who sometimes came to the club and they explained the problems young players, or maybe also older players can meet, especially in this social media world.”CNN has reached out to Ajax for further comment.The youth development system for soccer players in the Netherlands is impressive, according to Endt.“There’s also always attention to be aware of your responsibilities not only to yourself, or your teammates, but also in view of the world around you, that you have to behave well, that a good player is also an example in life. But not everybody is following this, obviously.”"

        "title": "British runner Jasmin Paris becomes first woman to finish Barkley Marathons, just 99 seconds before time limit expired",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "British runner Jasmin Paris became the first woman ever to finish the legendary Barkley Marathons on Friday.According to Keith Dunn who attends the race and provides updates on X – formerly known as Twitter – Paris finished the grueling course with a time of 59 hours, 58 minutes and 21 seconds; just 99 seconds before the 60-hour time limit elapsed.The 40-year-old veterinarian was photographed collapsing over the finish line as she completed the race.Paris was one of five finishers in the 2024 edition of the Barkley Marathons, with Ukrainian Ihor Verys finishing first, American’s John Kelly and Jared Campbell finishing second and third respectively and Greig Hamilton from New Zealand finishing fourth.Verys, who finished with a time of 58:44:59, told Dunn: “Maybe you should add a sixth loop.”Conversely, Campbell – who completed the Barkley Marathons for the fourth time with a time of 59:30:32 – said: “That new section is brutal. You are a bad man.”Paris made headlines in 2019 when she won the 2019 Spine Race, becoming the first woman to win the 268-mile race as well as taking 12 hours off the previous record.The Barkley Marathons has become famous for its grueling, near-impossible nature. It is thought by many to be the hardest, most brutal foot race in the world.The famed ultramarathon, the brainchild of runner Gary Cantrell, takes place in Tennessee’s Frozen Head State Park. The route was inspired by the 1977 prison escape of James Earl Ray, who assassinated the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.Ray traveled only eight miles in just over two days after escaping Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary before he was recaptured, leading Cantrell to muse that he could cover 100 miles in the same amount of time.The route is long and indistinguishable, the inclines are steep, and the terrain unforgiving, but that’s only if you’re able to navigate the opaque entry system and earn a spot on the start line in the first place.The race consists of five loops of around 20 miles each, for a total of between 100 to 130 miles through brushy mountains with an elevation gain of around 63,000 feet. Athletes run the course over three sleepless days and nights – and there are no aid stations, phones or GPS to help with navigation. Getting lost – as well as falling and getting injured in the brush – is par for the course.The ultramarathon is marked with unique unmanned checkpoints, each of which contains a paperback book. Athletes must rip out a page corresponding to their bib number and have all the book pages in hand at the end of each loop to prove they reached each checkpoint.The races’ tough nature makes it a tough finish for many, with no finishers between 2017 and 2023. It has a dropout rate of 99%."

        "text": "It’s the hope that kills you as over 99% of March Madness bracket fans brutally discovered after day one of the men’s tournament, which is already delivering its fair share of shocks.Following the surprise defeats suffered by No. 3 seed Kentucky and No. 8 seed Mississippi State, less than 1% of all brackets remain intact.According to the NCAA social media account, just 0.00038% of brackets in the men’s tournament are still active. And it is a similar case elsewhere.Yahoo announced that just 116 perfect brackets remain on its website. Meanwhile ESPN said that over 22 million brackets were broken, with just 1,825 perfect ones left.So take a bow, Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson.The NCAA’s X – formerly known as Twitter – account tweeted that Robinson, who has just finished an excellent rookie campaign in the NFL, was one of the few remaining players with a chance of a perfect bracket.“Perfect day 1 haha kinda dope,” Robinson replied.Achieving a perfect bracket is one of the few things in sports left to achieve, with fans needing huge amounts of luck and skill to pick all 63 games correctly.Due to the number of upsets and “Cinderella” stories March Madness tends to throw up, it has proven an impossible feat so far: the odds of getting every result correct are an extraordinary one to nine quintillion.As explained to CNN Sport in 2023 by Tim Chartier – distinguished visiting professor at the US National Museum of Mathematics and Joseph R. Morton professor of mathematics and computer science at Davidson College – nine quintillion is a nine followed by 18 zeroes.Chartier helped put that into context: “I’m going to pick one second in 292 billion years, and your job is to tell me which second I pick.”If you’re struggling with the numbers, Chartier suggests a physical representation of the nine quintillion to help. He says that the height of nine quintillion dollar bills stacked on top of one another is equivalent to the distance of going from Earth to Pluto over 60 times."

In the second half, led by guard Jaxson Robinson’s 25 points, the Cougars kept it close, tying the game with just under two minutes to go, but came up short in the come-from-behind bid.Dae Dae Grant led the way for the Dukes, scoring 19 points, while Jimmy Clark III added 11 to power Duquesne to the program’s first victory in the NCAA tournament since 1969. It’s also the first in the tournament for head coach Keith Dambrot.Dambrot, the former high school head coach of NBA superstar LeBron James, announced he would retire after his team’s run.“They just don’t want me to retire I guess, I’m trying to get to the promise land and they’re making me keep coaching,” Dambrot said after the game. “But hey, our guys played exactly what they had to do in order to win the game, keep the score down and they’re a load on offense so it was a battle all game long.”“I thought we did an unbelievable job of taking their punches and punching back. You know, they wobbled us for sure,” Dambrot added. “We were wobbling, legged, we had a cut under our eye, over our eye but we just kept fighting back.”Dambrot coached James at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio, where in the final two seasons at the helm, St. Vincent-St. Mary were state champions, earning USA Today national rankings.On Wednesday, the team posted a video of players receiving brand new sneakers gifted to them by the four-time NBA champion.“AYYYYYYYEEEEE!!! First tournament win in 55 years! @CoachDambrot,” James posted on X after the team’s victory. “@DuqMBB. Keep it going.”Duquesne will next play No. 3 seed Illinois in the second round on Saturday."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "A Barcelona court has ruled that former Brazilian international soccer player Dani Alves could be conditionally released from prison on a bail of $1.08 million (one million euros) following his conviction last month for sexual assault, the court press office said in a statement Wednesday.The Barcelona provincial court sentenced Alves on February 22 to four-and-a-half years in prison for sexually assaulting a woman in one of the city’s nightclubs in late December 2022.In the court’s 13-page ruling on the bail, viewed by CNN, the court said Alves has already served 14 months in prison, including in pre-trial detention since his arrest in Barcelona in January 2023, and more recently, since his conviction.Alves’ lawyer has announced an appeal of the conviction and the sentence. In the bail ruling, the court said that if Alves actually pays the $1.08 million bail, he then would have to surrender his Spanish and Brazilian passports and report weekly to the court.The court also ruled that the former Barcelona player could not get closer than a kilometer (roughly 0.6 miles) to the victim, nor have any communication with her of any kind.Two judges approved the bail ruling, while a third judge dissented, and the decision can be appealed, the court said.CNN has reached out to lawyers for Alves and the victim but did not immediately get a response from either.The 40-year-old Alves is one of the most decorated soccer players of his generation, winning domestic titles in Spain, Italy and France. He won three Champions League titles with Barcelona in 2009, 2011 and 2015 and the Copa América with Brazil in 2007 and 2019.In the 61-page sentence from Alves’ trial, which was seen by CNN, the three-judge panel wrote that they “considered proven that the accused abruptly grabbed the plaintiff, threw her to the floor and prevented her from moving” to carry out the sexual assault in December 2022.That was “in spite of the plantiff saying no, that she wanted to leave,” the judges added. Alves insisted during the trial that the sexual relations were consensual."

        "text": "Israel’s hopes of reaching Euro 2024 are over after the team suffered a heavy 4-1 defeat to Iceland in Thursday’s playoff semifinal.The game began well for Israel as Eran Zahavi, the national team’s all-time record goalscorer, broke the deadlock from the penalty spot just after the half-hour mark.However, two quick goals from Albert Guðmundsson and Arnór Ingvi Traustason ensured Iceland went into the half-time break with the lead.Israel was then reduced to 10 men with more than 15 minutes remaining after Roy Revivo was rightly shown a red card for a wild lunge on Arnór Sigurðsson.But Zahavi still had a glorious chance to level the scores 10 minutes before the end after Israel was awarded another penalty, but he scuffed his effort wide of the post before burying his face in his hands.That miss led to a late Israel capitulation as Guðmundsson scored two late goals to seal his hat-trick and secure an eye-catching victory for Iceland, which is looking to book its place at a first major tournament since the 2018 World Cup.Israel was designated as the home team in this qualifier but has been playing its matches in Hungary due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.Iceland, meanwhile, will now face Ukraine for a place at Euro 2024 after the Ukrainians produced a stunning late comeback to beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 2-1 on Thursday.After an own goal from Mykola Matviyenko had given Bosnia the lead early in the second half, Ukraine looked to be on the brink of elimination.However, goals from from Roman Yaremchuk and Artem Dobvyk in the space of three minutes just before the end turned the game on its head and ensured Ukraine remains in with a chance of reaching a fourth straight European Championship.Ukraine will be designated as the home team against Iceland, but Tuesday’s match will be played in Wrocław, Poland, due to Russia’s ongoing invasion.Elsewhere, Wales will host Poland and Greece will travel to Georgia in the other Euro 2024 playoff finals.Euro 2024 will be played in Germany from June 14 to July 14."

        "title": "This golf course architect’s daughter was diagnosed non-verbal autistic. Now he’s helping families facing similar challenges",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "His golf course design business flourishing, Bobby Weed was sailing smoothly into the turn of the century. Gradually, and then suddenly, he and his family lurched into uncharted waters.Born in 1998, Lanier – the youngest of Weed’s three daughters – stopped walking and talking at 18 months old. Shortly after, she was diagnosed with nonverbal autism.“You know when you go up to an electrical panel and just start hitting the breakers and turning them off? That’s about what started happening with her,” Weed recalled to CNN.With 1 in 36 children – about 2.8% – identified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 2020, according to estimates by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), awareness and understanding of the developmental disability is rising. Yet when Lanier was diagnosed, Weed and his wife Leslie, who lived in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, found themselves plunged into a world far less educated.In 2000, just 1 in 150 children were identified with ASD by the CDC. Combined with the fact that the condition is almost four times more common in boys than girls, it meant that Lanier’s case was even more unfamiliar to professionals and Weed alike at the time. The family found themselves in “uncharted territory,” Weed said.“We didn’t even know what autism was,” he added. “We had to pretty much teach and train ourselves.“It changed our lives. It changed our family … We immediately felt like we were in a canoe crossing the Atlantic by ourselves, and everybody else was on a big ship. It was really, really difficult – challenging in every way.”A frenzied search for support saw Weed jetting to specialists across the US, while his wife immersed herself in learning as much as she could about autism – so much so that Weed recalled her attending conferences and being mistaken for a doctor or an attorney.Such a dogged pursuit caused significant upheaval. Weed’s two other daughters – Haley and Carlisle – were sent to boarding school to spare them the “total chaos” enveloping the house, as a flurry of doctors, therapists, and specialists came through the door. At one point, Weed had six people employed to help assist Lanier, he recalled.Strains were felt financially, with Weed – all-the-while boarding long flights for various course design projects – feeling “like a human ATM.” Then, there was the potential impact on his marriage, yet the experience only served to bring he and his wife – who first met on a golf-related blind date – closer together.“It showed me a side of my wife that I didn’t know existed,” Weed said.“I didn’t know I had such a warrior wife and that she was in the trenches 24/7 … It was a challenge like no other. I could see it was a massive divorce rate in association with autism but, from my perspective, it actually strengthened our marriage and it strengthened our family overall.”Determined to share what they had learned with other families in Northeast Florida navigating similar challenges, in 2004 the couple created the Helping Enrich Autistic Lives (HEAL) Foundation to educate and fund services for those affected by autism.The foundation has since raised over $5 million in support of the local autism community, providing annual Spring and Fall grants to various associated organizations and funding $500,000 for public and private school education enhancements for ASD students.They have funded the training of autism service dogs, as well as the delivery of over 500 iPads and 200 tricycles to students with special needs, and bankroll a series of summer camps, including Help Us Golf (HUG) Camp.Staged at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida – site of The Players Championship and among Weed’s most famous projects – the summer camp sees local PGA pros assist in teaching the game to children with autism. Though it offers the chance to play the iconic 17th Island Green, learning to swing a club at one of the world’s most well-known courses is just one part of the experience.“It’s a wonderful camp that goes much further than just golf,” Weed said.“They show them all the wildlife associated with the golf course, all the water features, show them how to change the cups on the greens, how all the grass gets mowed. It becomes so educational.”TPC Sawgrass has been a recurring spot for the foundation ever since it hosted a 2007 Gala in celebration of the PGA Tour choosing HEAL as its “Adopt-A-Charity” recipient – choosing the foundation as its sponsor for a tournament at the course.Having worked for the PGA Tour for 13 years before leaving to start his own design firm in 1996, Weed’s contact book within the game is bursting at the seams. Several of the biggest names he’s associated with have offered support to the foundation, including design mentor Pete Dye and seven-time major champion Arnold Palmer, who Weed says once offered his private plane to allow him and Lanier to fly to see a specialist in Chicago.And as Weed, who also designed Michael Jordan’s private golf course in Hobe Sound, continues to shape courses around the globe, most weekends are spent with his youngest daughter, now 25.Lanier lives in a nearby residential group home, which offers round-the-clock support for adults with autism.“It’s been good for our daughter and it’s been good for us,” Weed said.“We see our daughter every weekend, we have access to her, and there’s a bit of a comfort level knowing that she’s safe, she’s secure, that we can coexist together, and that we’re still family.”"

But it’s just one of those situations. It is what it is. You got to deal with it and just keep moving on and stay positive.”Garoppolo will join the Rams as the team’s backup quarterback behind starter Matthew Stafford.He has experience as a backup quarterback having done so with the New England Patriots behind Tom Brady, during which time he won Super Bowl XLIX and LI.He has since had stints with the San Francisco 49ers and an injury-blighted year with the Raiders before joining the Rams.“I’m excited to start this new journey,” Garoppolo said. “I don’t know exactly what is in store for me. But yeah, maybe reset, reinvent, whatever you want to call it – I’m just excited to get back on the football field and start slinging around with some new guys. I love football.“I love going out there with the guys. I love every bit of it. So I’m just excited to get back out there and start throwing again.”"

We implore Sutton to turn himself in,” Martello added.Sutton fled the scene with his phone shut off, according to the sheriff’s office. Sutton might be driving a Jeep Grand Wagoneer with the license plate number FL-AZ33QB, the office said on X.“No tip is too small,” said Martello. “Our deputies are welcoming anyone with info to call 813-247-8200.”In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, the Lions had said, “We became aware of the ongoing legal situation involving Cam Sutton this morning. We will continue to monitor the situation and will not have further comment at this time.”The seven-year veteran was set to enter his second season with the NFC North division champion Detroit Lions after being drafted by and spending six years with the Pittsburgh Steelers.Sutton started all 17 regular season games for the Lions last season, making 65 combined tackles with one interception. He also played in the Lions’ three playoff contests, recording eight tackles.Sutton played collegiately at the University of Tennessee after a high school career in Jonesboro, Georgia."

Afterwards their match, the pair embraced at the net and shared a moment together.“No, I wasn’t surprised at all (by Sabalenka’s play)”, Badosa told reporters after losing to Sabalenka. “She’s a very, very strong woman, strong personality, you can see it on the court. I knew she was going to play very well and I told her I wish her the best and let’s see if she can go very deep in this tournament.”Although Sabalenka served three double faults in her opening two service games, she settled into her usual, powerful rhythm and broke her opponent at 4-3, before rounding off the set.Then, in the second set, she broke Badosa twice more while her own serve remained impregnable and she completed her victory in an hour and 23 minutes.Sabalenka will now face Ukraine’s Anhelina Kalinina in the third round of the tournament.Elsewhere in the tournament, US Open champion Coco Gauff defeated Argentine qualifier Nadia Podoroska 6-1 6-2 to secure her spot in the third round."

His quarterfinal against Alexander Zverev was affected by a swarm of bees and he then had to come from a set down against Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner in the semifinals.The Spaniard faced more adversity when Medvedev broke him in his first service game of the final, but Alcaraz hit back with a break of his own before edging his Russian opponent in a tie-break which at one point was locked at 5-5.The second set was more straight forward for Alcaraz as he broke Medvedev twice – at 1-0 and 4-1 – before completing the victory in an hour and 42 minutes when the world No. 4 sent a cross-court forehand wide.The 20-year-old Alcaraz ended the match with 23 winners – 19 of which were on his forehand side – compared to Medvedev’s 11 and won 73% of his service points to the Russian’s 56%.Alcaraz now joins compatriot Rafael Nadal as the second male player to win five Masters 1,000 tournaments before the age of 21.Earlier on Sunday, Iga Świątek also won her second Indian Wells title as she defeated Greece’s Maria Sakkari 6-4 6-0.The Polish World No. 1, who also beat Sakkari in the final two years ago, didn’t drop a set over the course of the tournament and needed just 68 minutes to wrap up the title, winning eight games in a row across the first and second sets.It marked the 19th WTA Tour title of Świątek’s career and her second this year after winning the Qatar Open last month."

        "title": "Women’s college basketball: How Caitlin Clark rewrote the rules",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Caitlin Clark stands alone on the Iowa Hawkeyes’ home floor, with 15,000 fans transfixed by the moment — and more than three million viewers watching on television.She drains a free throw. Effortless. Then another. The home crowd erupts.These routine points earlier this month surpassed the all-time college basketball scoring record, for both men and women, launching Clark into the pantheon of the sport.It’s been a season for the ages for Clark, 22, whose talent has fueled a boom in interest in the women’s game as March Madness got underway this week.NBA star Steph Curry called her record-breaking performance “must-see TV” in an interview with CBS earlier this month.Viewers apparently agree.This year, college women’s basketball has had one of its best regular seasons in history, with regular season games averaging 476,000 viewers on ESPN platforms, where it has seen a 37% viewership increase.The audience for women’s college basketball has increased by more than 60% across all national networks, and more than 48% on games shown by the network, where it is averaging a bigger audience than its men’s counterpart, according to Michael Mulvihill, president of insight and analytics at Fox Sports.Clark – a six-foot senior known for both her shooting and passing game – has undoubtedly driven those numbers, said Jon Lewis, who has tracked sports ratings on his website Sports Media Watch since 2006. Lewis compared her to Curry and other transcendent stars, such as LeBron James and Michael Jordan.“These are the type of players that, when they’re playing, people tune in and pay attention to in a way that they don’t for other players,” he said.Clark’s final-season statistics, which helped her top Pete Maravich’s record, also bear similarities to Curry’s last year with Davidson. Clark is averaging 31.9 points a game and 38% from three-point range, while Curry averaged 28.6 points and 39% from deep.While Clark is enticing viewers, women’s college basketball is experiencing growth that can’t only be explained by “Clarkonomics”– as basketball analyst Debbie Antonelli called it – alone.The rise in its popularity is coinciding with an overall increase in the prominence of women’s sports.That rise is due to improved TV coverage – such as featuring games on major networks and in optimal time slots – and the way that young female athletes have used the platform of Name, Image and Likeness, or NIL, which has allowed college and high school athletes to earn income from sponsorships, among other factors.Iowa and Clark have featured in six of the 10-most viewed women’s basketball games this season, all earning more than one million viewers, according to data from SportsMediaWatch. The most viewed game this season eclipsed any women’s college basketball contest since 1999, when a UConn and Tennessee rivalry matchup had 3.88 million average viewers.While “mainstream” fans have always known programs like UConn and Tennessee, more attention has been focused lately on newer stars, said Melissa Isaacson, an assistant sports journalism professor at Northwestern. Notably, last year’s championship, which averaged nearly 10 million viewers, introduced the country to Iowa’s Clark and LSU’s Angel Reese.The surge in women’s college basketball is also due to more investment in media coverage of women’s sports, said Lewis.For example, this season is just the third year in which the NCAA has attached the “March Madness” branding to the women’s tournament.“A lot of it is, ‘Hey let’s put these games on where people can actually watch them,’” Lewis said. “There’s something real happening in the women’s game that’s not limited to Caitlin Clark and is unique even among women’s sports.”And, as of March 19, fans who went to TickPick to get tickets for the Final Four had purchased six times as many for the women’s final than for the men’s final, the seller said.College women’s basketball players are among the biggest players in the market for Name, Image and Likeness sponsorships.College women’s basketball players are among the biggest players in the market for Name, Image and Likeness sponsorships.NIL is only in its third year and football players make most of the earnings, but female basketball players are also racking in large sponsorships.Sponsorships for college women’s basketball are projected to reach $60 million by the end of the third year of NIL, according to data from Opendorse, a platform that arranges brand deals between athletes and sponsors.While Clark, Reese and other women’s stars such as Cameron Brink and Paige Bueckers possess huge followings, top men’s college players, such as Reed Sheppard, Rob Dillingham and Cody Williams – who may be destined for this year’s NBA draft – are seemingly less well-known.Using Instagram followers as a barometer, Dillingham has the most of those men’s players with 669,000, while Clark and Bueckers all have over a million, with Reese boasting 2.7 million.“By making these deals possible …[NIL] has shed more light on the individuals and, by proxy, on their sports,” said Sam Weber, who heads communications at Opendorse.There was even speculation that Clark might stay in college rather than entering the WNBA draft to retain her lucrative NIL deals. Bueckers of UConn, for example, chose to stay for a fifth year of eligibility granted by the league to players affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.One factor driving the speculation that Clark might stay in college was that WNBA doesn’t have the same platform as women’s college basketball.While Clark and Reese played for nearly 10 million viewers in last year’s college championship, Game 4 of the WNBA finals peaked with 1.3 million viewers, averaging 889,000. The full four-game series averaged 728,000 viewers, according to data from Sports Media WatchThe WNBA has historically had a smaller audience than college women’s basketball, according to Lewis. That’s in part because it hasn’t been around as long: By the league’s first season, in 1997, several college women’s programs had already developed strong fan bases, Isaacson said.But there’s a precedent for college stars bringing large audiences with them to the WNBA. Five-time Olympic gold medalist, all-time WNBA scoring leader and three-time WNBA champion Diana Taurasi’s first game in 2004 was the most-watched game on ESPN/ABC, according to Lewis.Three-time WNBA champion and two-time gold medalist Candace Parker’s first game in 2008 also drew large audiences, Lewis added.Ticket prices to watch the Indiana Fever – the team eyeing Clark for its No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft – have more than doubled.The crescendo to Clark’s college career could come in the form of a national title. But if that result remains elusive, she will have transcended the college game — and brought legions of newly engaged viewers along with her."

        "title": "‘When I see Russian athletes … I see every city destroyed,’ says Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "At some point last year, Yaroslava Mahuchikh vowed to stop reading the news before competitions, so distressing did she find the stories and images of bloodshed in her native Ukraine.One of the world’s top high jumpers, Mahuchikh knew that absolute concentration was required to perfectly execute her run-up, take-off and back-arching leap, but still her mind would gravitate towards the distressing situation thousands of miles away back home.Perhaps that’s only natural when your country is at war and fresh missile attacks are being launched on a regular basis – some even directed at blocks in your hometown.“It’s challenging for me to compete after reading the news of rockets sent to civilians,” Mahuchikh tells CNN Sport. “I’m thinking about how many people died, how many peoples’ houses were destroyed. It’s difficult.”That strategy – of trying to shut out Russia’s invasion of Ukraine before she competes – proved effective last year. Mahuchikh won her first world championship title in August, then successfully defended her Diamond League Final victory in September.Understandably, her confidence is now high for the months ahead. That includes the Millrose Games in New York this weekend, the world indoor championships in Glasgow in March and then the Paris Olympics in July and August.She’s unsure if she will return to Ukraine in that time having moved between various training bases around Europe for most of the past two years. Because of the war, itinerancy has become a common theme in her life.“I live in a suitcase, really,” says Mahuchikh, “because with traveling, we don’t have a hometown.”Her family – her mother and sister – have sometimes joined the 22-year-old while she is on the road, but her father, like many Ukrainians, has stayed at home in Dnipro. That’s often a source of anxiety for Mahuchikh, especially when Russian attacks target the eastern city.“My father, he said that, unfortunately, for a lot of people, it’s life right now, we live in this way,” she explains.“And they continue their life. My father sometimes says, ‘Oh, you know, if the rockets come, it’s okay, it’s my life, maybe it’s God saying that it’s finished.’ And I say, ‘Oh my gosh, father, please – go to the basement.’”Dnipro has absorbed several deadly missile attacks throughout the invasion, with the Russian military targeting apartment blocks and medical facilities in the city.In August last year, Ukraine’s War Crimes Department in the Prosecutor General’s Office said that approximately 10,749 civilians had been killed during the war and 15,599 wounded.Yet even as fighting rages on, Mahuchikh still longs for the familiarity of being back home with her family and friends.“If I was not an athlete at international level, I think I would be in Ukraine,” she says. “But I have some goals and I’m competing for my country. I represent Ukraine at competitions; it’s my goal and it’s my mission, I think.”Russia’s invasion has invigorated Mahuchikh’s sense of national pride. She wore blue and yellow eye shadow – the colors of the Ukrainian flag – at last year’s world championships and is supporting fundraising efforts to send wheelchairs to disabled orphans in Ukraine.She also hopes that competing at high-profile events and winning gold medals will provide her with a platform from which to highlight her country’s plight.“I feel that I am an ambassador of Ukraine and I have this possibility to involve a lot of people in this problem that Ukrainian people now have,” says Mahuchikh.“A lot of families are under rocket attack; a lot of children, unfortunately, lost their parents or parents lost their children. It’s so sad, and it’s so sad that a lot of athletes and coaches died in this war. But I want to help my country. It’s the main goal.”According to Vadim Guttsait, Ukraine’s sports minister and president of its National Olympic Committee (NOC), more than 400 Ukrainian athletes have been killed since the start of the war.This year’s Olympics, Mahuchikh believes, will enable Ukrainian athletes to promote a message of peace, though perhaps inevitably, the Games have also become entwined in geopolitics.In particular, the question of whether athletes from Russia and Belarus, a key military launchpad during the war in Ukraine, will be able to compete has become a flashpoint.In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that athletes from those two countries will be able to take part as neutrals in Paris, so long as they meet certain eligibility criteria.For example, only individual athletes, rather than teams, will be included in the Games, and athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to their country’s military services will be ineligible.However, international federations have the first say on whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can qualify for the Olympics. World Athletics, the governing body of track and field, has excluded Russian and Belarusians from events “for the foreseeable future,” meaning they will be unable to compete in track and field events in Paris as things stand.It’s a contentious topic: some, like the IOC’s executive board, believe that individual athletes shouldn’t be stopped from competing on the basis of their passport, while others, namely a campaign group representing Ukrainian athletes, argue that Russian participation of any kind only strengthens the country’s “propaganda machine.”Mahuchikh welcomes World Athletics’ stance, believing that neutral flags are an ineffective way of concealing an athlete’s national identity.“When I see Russian athletes … I see every city destroyed, every life that was destroyed by Russian people, by the Russian Federation,” she says, adding that she would find it “difficult” to compete against athletes from Russia and Belarus.Last month, more than 200 sportspeople from Ukraine wrote a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron, urging Russians and Belarusians to be banned from competing at the Games.However, neither local organizers nor the French government have jurisdiction over who qualifies for the Olympics, and Paris 2024 organizers have underlined that this responsibility lies with the IOC and international federations.Guttsait has previously suggested that Ukraine could boycott the Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete, though a final decision is yet to be made.Mahuchikh is against such a move, instead believing that the Olympics should represent “peace in all the world.” A bronze medalist in Tokyo three years ago, she is also one of Ukraine’s biggest stars in Paris, aiming to win what would be her country’s first gold medal in the high jump.“Every athlete wants to compete, every athlete wants to win the gold medal,” says Mahuchikh. “Of course, I have goals for winning, and I want to have this medal in my sports career.”She has tweaked her technique ahead of the upcoming indoor season, shortening her run-up to compensate for her increased speed as she approaches the bar. Having made her season debut in Cottbus, Germany, last weekend – finishing first after clearing a world-leading height of two meters and four centimeters (about 6.69 feet) – the new technique will be put to the test again at the Millrose Games.This is where Mahuchikh’s immediate focus lies, but in the long term, she has loftier ambitions for her career – namely Stefka Kostadinova’s world record of two meters and nine centimeters (about 6.86 feet).The Bulgarian’s mark has stood since 1987, making it one of the longest-standing world records in track and field. Mahuchikh has watched the likes of Karsten Warholm and Mondo Duplantis – both, like her, sponsored by Puma – set records in the 400-meter hurdles and the pole vault respectively, and now she hopes to join the club.“I believe that one day I will jump 2.10,” she says. “I want to be part of this family of world record holders.”"

        "title": "These young female athletes died by suicide. They all had head injuries in common",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common.Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain’s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.Both were incredibly smart – Catlin was studying for a master’s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.Yet these two women’s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.Women’s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men’s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN.“It’s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,” McKee added.“We do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don’t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,” she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women’s necks could play a part.Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.Catlin’s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was “intense” and “ambitious,” attributes she channeled into her sporting life.Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road. Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn’t her first crash – she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn’t have any symptoms at the time.But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.“She couldn’t compete,” her father said. “Kelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she’s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.”On closer inspection, Catlin’s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford’s Health Centre.A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC.When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said.“There wasn’t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,” he told CNN.CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.Catlin’s symptoms didn’t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate.Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds.She tried to train, but “she would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,” according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with “no exercise tolerance whatsoever,” he added.Her injury had other consequences.“As far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor. She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,” her father told CNN.“She basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn’t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that’s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,” he added.At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN.A month after that attempt, she took her own life.Soutter’s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter – not only was she an “adrenaline junkie,” but she was “very conscientious” and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school – and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.“It was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,” her father said. “She just made it look graceful and beautiful.”But training took its toll – Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.“I was being advised by doctors “Oh, don’t worry, she’s young enough she’ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,” he told CNN.“With every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,” he added. “I was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.”But Soutter’s final concussion was so “huge” that she spent two nights in the hospital.“When I got there, she didn’t even know who I was or where she was,” her father said.Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018. But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was “absolutely fine” and could continue competing.Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.“She would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she’d go blind. She’d not be able to see – everything would go black and dark,” her father said.After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.“As Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,” a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email.“She was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity – training or competition – overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,” they added.The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: “We take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.”Catlin and Soutter aren’t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way.After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.“For someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,” Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay’s brain, told CNN.“We haven’t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,” he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn’t done peer reviewed research on this. “But what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains – this is not normal for someone of that age.”Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found.Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion.One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing “behavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can’t suppress impulses the way you normally could.”With these emotional problems, “they would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,” Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN.A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them “from being the person that they were before their injury.”Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was “a combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.”There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men.Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.McKee said all athletes can also experience “non-concussive” injuries: “hits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don’t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.”Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts – including concussion and non- concussive injuries – increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is “associated with recurrent concussions.”But scientists aren’t only concerned about concussions.Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts – repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms – can still result in long-term neurological disease.According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, “the best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.”There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation.And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely “equally important,” McKee said.“We also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,” she said.“We’re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,” she said.McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries.“The problem is the subclinical hits – the non-concussive injuries that aren’t detected, you don’t pull the player off the field – and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,” she explained.Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions.Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes – but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn’t have any women in a sample of participants at all.There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women’s health and brain injury, told CNN.There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports.Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don’t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren’t spotted as routinely.“They tend to push really hard through the injury,” she said.And many women can’t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers.“When they really crater, it’s a couple of days or weeks later.”Snedaker said female athletes often weren’t aware they had suffered a head injury.If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform.The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn’t get enough support after their injuries.After Catlin’s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found “they were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,” her father told CNN.She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital – but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.“Wherever she turned she could not find help,” he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer.Catlin described his daughter as a “stoic, female warrior type person that isn’t going to admit that she’s struggling.”“She needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.”Her father said a major factor in his daughter’s death was “a lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly’s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren’t,” he added.In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin’s family. She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students’ experiences, “supporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.”“Students in need of mental health crisis assistance – including students having suicidal thoughts – and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,” she added.Rapport said that in addition to this, “there are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.”In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was “devastated” by Catlin’s death, adding: “She brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.“As the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,” a representative for USA Cycling added.After his daughter Ellie’s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE.But even in that facility – the biggest of its kind in the world – of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN.“When I actually started looking into CTE – all of the work that they’ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,” Soutter told CNN.“It was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms … Every one that’s involved in CTE was part of Ellie’s life,” he added.“I truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.”Editor’s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.For support outside of the US, a worldwide directory of resources and international hotlines is provided by the International Association for Suicide Prevention.

        "text": "Grambling State men’s basketball won its first NCAA tournament game in program history on Wednesday, when the No. 16-seeded Tigers defeated fellow No. 16 seed Montana State 88-81 in overtime in the First Four.The Tigers were led by a career night from guard Jimel Cofer, who scored 19 points after averaging just 2.8 points for the season, as the team produced an epic comeback victory.Trailing by as many as 14 points in the second half, Grambling State went on two separate 11-0 runs to overhaul the Bobcats’ lead.The Tigers were also helped by 18 points and nine rebounds from senior guard Jourdan Smith, while forward Antwan Burnett added another 18 points.“I just know my team has my back,” Cofer said, per Sports Illustrated. “Anybody on this team can get hot at any time. It was just my night.”The First Four features four No. 16 seeds and four No. 10 seeds competing for a place at March Madness when the tournament tips off on Thursday.Grambling State head coach Donte’ Jackson called it “incredible” when asked about his team’s historic achievement.“It’s what March is made of baby,” Jackson told the truTV broadcast. “You got to find a way to fight. Stay in the game and have one last run.”The Tigers will face No. 1-seeded Purdue Boilermakers on Friday in Indianapolis in the first round of March Madness’ Midwest Regional.Bookmakers have Purdue as the third favorite to win the tournament behind the UConn Huskies and the Houston Cougars.Jackson, the 2023-24 SWAC coach of the year, added that the team has not yet had the chance to think about facing the Boilermakers.“Hey listen, we got to get to the room, pack up, figure it out, start on film and just worry about how we can throw the whole house, the kitchen – whatever – the backyard at [Purdue center] Zach Edey,” Jackson said.“We just need to figure it out. We let the chips fall where they may. They ain’t expect us to win this one.”"

        "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.“There’s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you’ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,” the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation – a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is “the only sport that can save your life.”The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.“I used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,” she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.“There’s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,” Dale adds.She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London.It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people – and leaving many more without homes.“There’s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons … who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,” Dale says.“Many people say it’s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they’ve taken time for themselves.”While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England’s report, published in January 2020.Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found.This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have “low” or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country’s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a “Whites Only” rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England – England’s national swimming governing body – and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.“Most drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,” says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family – a 53-year-old father and his two children – died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.“This was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,” Obe says. “(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, ‘We’ve been talking about doing something for our community. We’ve got to do something. We’ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.’”“It’s no longer just about that lack of representation,” Obe adds.“It’s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.”However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.“At the moment, we don’t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn’t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.”Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, “implores” people to learn to swim.“I have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who’s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,” she tells CNN Sport.“I take the two of them just as they are – kind of like separate things. I’m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.”At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people – especially Black girls – who wanted to break into the sport.But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.“Fortunately, for myself, I haven’t come across any barriers at the level I’m at currently,” Dearing says.“But I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don’t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we’re better suited to other sports and so shouldn’t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.”CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.FINA – the global governing body for swimming – told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its “Swimming for All, Swimming for Life” program.“FINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,” the organization said to CNN in a statement. “FINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally.“Work will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,” FINA added.Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is “committed to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.”“Barriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups – like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,” the statement added.Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than £550 million ($670 million), which they’ve selected “due to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.”“It’s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,” Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.“Our goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they’re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,” he added.Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.From representing their organization at the UK’s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney – one of the most deprived boroughs in London – Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.“That community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,” says Obe.“Only in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.”In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.Speaking about the program, Obe says: “It’s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we’re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don’t engage in aquatics, why we don’t see the representation pool side and why we don’t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.”Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she’s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.“I really think if anything is going to change, it’s going to be now, it’s going to be over the next couple of years,” she says. “Each story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there’s nothing wrong with that, that’s just another challenge that we have to face and we’re up for it.“It’s tough – it’s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.“I like to feel that I’m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.“It’s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it’s really frightening and daunting, but if I’m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.”"

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "An exhale of collective relief rippled around TPC Sawgrass as Austin Eckroat’s birdie putt finally abandoned its precarious position on the edge of the cup and dropped in. Yet the satisfaction would be short-lived.The American left with a par on the 11th hole during the final round of The Players Championship in Florida on Sunday, as a rule relating to the length of time a ball can overhang the hole saw him hit with a one stroke penalty.Eckroat, who won his first PGA Tour title at the Cognizant Classic earlier this month, had looked to have converted superbly from 20-feet, only for his ball to pause on the edge of the Stadium Course’s par-five 11th hole.The world No.48 and playing partner Joel Dahmen were crouched over the ball, staring intently, when it finally fell in almost 40 seconds later. It sparked a roar from the onlooking crowd, but a more muted reaction from Eckroat, whose mind had perhaps already drifted to a section of the Rules of Golf.Under rule 13.3a, a player is allowed “reasonable” time to reach the hole and 10 further seconds to wait and see if the ball drops in.Eckroat’s birdie would have stood had his putt fallen during this time, but as it was classed as being “at rest”, an additional penalty stroke saw him card par for the hole.The rule drew the ire of some fans responding to video of the incident posted by the PGA Tour on X. “Stupid rule,” replied Michael McEwen, deputy editor at golf site Bunkered.A similar series of events at last year’s PGA Championship involving American Lee Hodges saw the tournament’s rules body issue a statement explaining the penalty.There was no official statement from The Players rules committee for Eckroat’s incident as the penalty was “just the application of the rule,” a spokesperson for the PGA Tour told CNN.The penalty compounded what had been a frustrating final round for Eckroat.Having begun the day four-under par in tied-17th overall, two bogeys and a double bogey through his opening nine holes had dropped him back to even-par.He signed off with a four-over 76, his worst round of the week after shooting 71, 69, and 68 across the first three days.At 17-under par overall, world No.6 Xander Schauffele took a one shot lead into Sunday over reigning US Open champion Wyndham Clark, with a $4.5 million winner’s purse to come for the winner of the PGA Tour’s flagship event."

        "title": "Nike sparks controversy with ‘playful update’ to England’s cross of St. George",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Nike has come under pressure to scrap a flag design on its recently-released England soccer kit, including from UK opposition leader Keir Starmer.The new jersey features a small cross of St. George stitched in different colors onto the back of the collar, rather than the traditional red cross and white background of the English flag.Nike said that the design – which has various shades of blue, purple and red – is a “playful update” to the flag and is intended to “unite and inspire.”The top will be worn by England’s players at the European Championships in Germany later this year.Speaking to UK tabloid The Sun on Thursday, Labour Party leader Starmer said that the flag “doesn’t need to be changed.”He added: “I’m a big football fan. I go to England games, men’s and women’s games, and the flag is used by everybody. It is a unifier … We just need to be proud of it.“I think they should just reconsider this and change it back. I’m not even sure they can properly explain why they thought they needed to change it in the first place.”Starmer added that the price of the shirt, listed at £124.99 (around $157) on the Nike website, should also be reduced. The authentic men’s jersey is currently sold out on the Nike website, though women’s and kids’ versions are in stock.“We have been a proud partner of the FA since 2012 and understand the significance and importance of the St. George’s Cross and it was never our intention to offend, given what it means to England fans,” Nike said in a statement on Friday.“Together with the FA, the intention was to celebrate the heroes of 1966 and their achievements. The trim on the cuffs takes its cues from the training gear worn by England’s 1966 [World Cup-winning] heroes, with a gradient of blues and reds topped with purple. The same colours also feature an interpretation of the flag on the back of the collar.”The company has also released an away kit – purple with multi-colored side panels – for the Three Lions, but it’s the flag design on the home jersey which has sparked most debate on social media: some arguing that it’s disrespectful, others that it’s harmless and people are overreacting.“You wouldn’t expect Nike to go off and have a look at the Welsh flag and decide to change the dragon to a pussycat,” UK lawmaker Emily Thornberry told Sky News on Friday.“You wouldn’t expect the England flag to be changed like this. You wouldn’t expect bits of purple in the French Tricolor. Why are they doing it? I don’t understand.”This isn’t the first time that Nike has garnered criticism for an England football jersey. Ahead of last year’s Women’s World Cup, the company did not put the uniform worn by goalkeeper Mary Earps on sale, despite the Golden Glove winner’s campaigning efforts.Nike later acknowledged that it “didn’t serve those fans who wished to show their passion and support to the squad’s goalkeepers,” according to Reuters, and subsequently made the goalkeeper jerseys of several teams available for sale."

        "title": "Saudi Arabia is trying to disrupt soccer’s world order. The reasons why might surprise you",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbappé – including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year – it was slammed by critics as sportswashing.Mbappé might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (€90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports.In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe’s major leagues – France’s Ligue 1, Spain’s La Liga, Italy’s Serie A, Germany’s Bundesliga and the English Premier League – according to Deloitte.Despite the Arab nation’s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia’s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn’t “care” about the country’s investment in sport being described as sportswashing.“Well if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,” MBS said in an interview with Fox News which aired Wednesday.Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: “I don’t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we’re going to get that one and a half percent.”Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation’s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport.By attracting some of the world’s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants “to drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,” though it’s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop “young Saudi talent.”During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt.Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D’Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid.As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (€835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (€353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year.The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world’s highest paid soccer player.As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees – all international stars – play for one of the PIF-owned clubs.Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was “not in [the SPL’s] competitive advantage” to report the salaries offered to players and coaches.The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players.Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (£700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (£12 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq.In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers “just aren’t true.”“Essentially, the signal is ‘We mean business,’” Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.“We’ve got so much money that for a player who is … coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he’s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,” Chadwick said, describing Saudi’s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost.Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries – including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses.It remains to be seen whether Saudi’s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort.The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country’s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi’s victory over Argentina during last year’s men’s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win.Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. “For example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you’re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,” Chadwick said.Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of “The Price of Football” podcast.“From the Saudi authorities’ point of view, they’re getting a ready-made product. Everybody’s heard of Benzema. Everybody’s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,” Maguire said.Saudi Arabia’s lofty sporting ambitions don’t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup.Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men’s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt – although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy.Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between €35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year.Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country’s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals – and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30. Of this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport.Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia’s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring – and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated.Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, “what is just as significant is the security of the royal family,” Chadwick adds.The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region.Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria.“What we’re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,” Chadwick said.“You want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it … But don’t question us,” Chadwick explained.Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer “can be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.”At the same time, there has been “a significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country” this year, Chadwick told CNN.Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years.In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed.“Reputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and … Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,” James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, “The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,” explains.Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices.Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick – not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital.“Part of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that’s a way of attracting interest to the country,” said Maguire.CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of “sportswashing” its image.In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia’s purported “sportswashing,” the kingdom’s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: “People that don’t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they’ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi.“See what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,” he added.Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, “they feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.”In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport’s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up “owning golf.”Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men’s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport’s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control.“They have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,” he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours.When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football’s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose.“As far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don’t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don’t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,” he said last month.“When people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they’re playing.”Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: “I don’t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore.“I don’t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can’t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?” he added.Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is “no different from what the Premier League have done.”“There was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we’re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,” said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN.New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league’s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars.“We can’t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.” But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which “simply doesn’t exist in Saudi Arabia,” Chadwick explained to CNN.European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams’ spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs.Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy – up from its current value of “0.000 something.”“They’ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,” Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world’s domestic leagues.“That is feasible given the amount of money that they’re spending.”“I think they’re realistic. They don’t say that they’re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,” Maguire said.When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world’s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund.CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency.Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA’s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA’s systems of governance.The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia’s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour’s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf.Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league’s financial endeavors, “nobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.”“This vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,” Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is “signaling.”“It is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.”"

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "As a golf fan watching at a tournament, you have the privilege of being up close to all the action.Lining the course, spectators can almost reach out and touch their favorite players as they go about their business of driving, chipping and putting.That proximity also means that they are offered very little protection from potentially wayward shots – as one onlooker at The Players Championship on Saturday almost found out to their cost as they watched US golfer Max Homa at TPC Sawgrass.Homa had been enjoying a promising start to the tournament and was one-under par after the 13th hole in his third round and in touching distance of the leaders.Then things turned sour on the 14th hole for the 33-year-old American golfer.First, his drive found the water down the left before his next shot was shanked into the trees.With the 33-year-old’s progress towards the hole impeded by foliage, Homa was forced to attempt a relief shot back onto the fairway.When any player strays into the rough, fans tend to congregate and get an even closer look at a golfer’s ball-striking abilities.Homa warned those fans to take a step back so they would be out of harms way of the flight of his ball. However, when he did eventually attempt his third shot, Homa’s ball came within inches of hitting a fan, who was filming the golfer.In a video posted on TikTok taken from in front of Homa with the caption “who said golf was boring,” the ball is seen flying towards the camera at extreme speed, coming dangerously close to whoever is filming before a loud crack can be heard.In a separate video taken from behind Homa, the ball is shown whizzing over a spectator’s head before smashing against a tree just behind them.The close call seemed to delight watching fans, with some breaking out into laughter when they realized nobody had been hit.Homa eventually struggled to a quadruple-bogey nine on the par-four 14th hole, ruling him out of contention for the tournament.After his third round on Saturday, Homa explained that he had asked fans to move back, adding that the whole incident was “scary.”“I was trying to go much higher than that. Yesterday I should have probably asked them to move more but I didn’t think I was gonna knife it,” he told reporters.“But typically you ask them to move and it’s like two steps back – [they’re] kind of throwing caution to the wind at times with their own safety,” added Homa. “But I did not hit anybody … it was unfortunately freaky but I gave some people a good story. I heard a lot of people laughing so I got that out of it.”Homa also provided an update on social media afterwards.“FYI I did not hit anyone in the head on 14 yesterday. It smoked a tree,” Homa wrote on X – formerly known as Twitter. “Really thankful it missed the guy. That would have been devastating. Cool video tho if I do say so myself.”It might not fit into typical golfing attire but maybe fans should pack hard hats when they attend live events."

        "title": "Simona Halep loses on return from doping ban while Caroline Wozniacki criticizes awarding of Romanian’s wild card",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Simona Halep lost in her first match back since returning from her doping ban, losing in three sets, 6-1 4-6 3-6, to Paula Badosa at the Miami Open on Tuesday.The two-time grand slam champion was making her first appearance on court since the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) reduced her backdated four-year doping ban to nine months earlier this month, allowing her to return to competitive tennis.Halep was awarded a wild card spot to take part in the Miami Open shortly afterwards, a decision 2018 Australian Open winner Caroline Wozniacki criticized.Speaking after her first-round victory over Clara Burel, Wozniacki said that she believes people in Halep’s position should have to work their “way up from the bottom,” rather than be handed a wild card entry.“I have always wanted a clean sport, fair for everybody. I think it’s definitely still my opinion,” the Danish player told reporters. “This is not directly at Simona, but if someone purposely cheats, if someone has tested positive for doping … I understand why a tournament wants a big star in the tournament, but it’s my personal belief, and it’s not a knock on anyone, but it’s my personal belief that I don’t think people should be awarded wild cards afterwards.“If you want to come back, and it’s been a mistake, I understand, you should work your way up from the bottom. That’s my personal opinion upon things.”Wozniacki, a former world No. 1, said “clean sport” is imperative to her and is something she says has been pivotal in her career and a principle she implores to her children.“I want to have good role models for the young generation. It’s a sport that has a lot of money in it, a lot of competitiveness, a lot of competitors. I want a fair fight,” she said.When Wozniacki’s comments were put to her during a post-match press conference, a bemused Halep replied: “Why did she say that?“I didn’t do anything wrong. I didn’t cheat. I didn’t dope. So it’s better if we read the decision from CAS that it was a contaminated supplement, it wasn’t doping. I never had something to do with doping. I never doped, so I’m not a cheater,” the Romanian told reporters.“Thank you to the tournament for giving me the wild card and have the possibility to play in such a big tournament. It was great to be back. Only one person being negative about me is not that important because I have hundreds of people that giving me love, so I will take that.”Former world No. 1 Halep was handed the initial four-year ban in September 2023 after being found guilty of anti-doping rule violations by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) Independent Tribunal.Halep tested positive for banned substance Roxadustat – which is listed on the 2022 World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List – at the 2022 US Open. According to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), it is a class of drug called HIF-stabilizing agents and can increase an athlete’s red blood cell count and boost endurance performance.Before the CAS ruling, the ITIA had said that Halep’s suspension would run from October 7, 2022, until October 6, 2026.Halep has consistently maintained her innocence.Although she started strongly against Badosa, racing into a one-set lead thanks to a comprehensive 6-1 performance, the Romanian star faded late on, perhaps down to her lack of court time since October 2022.World No. 80 Badosa was able to take advantage of any rust on Halep’s part, breaking her as the match wore on to claim an important victory.Despite the result, Halep expressed her delight at finally being able to return to the court.“I would rate it as a special day, honestly, considering the period I had,” she said. “Playing so well, feeling so well on court, feeling so well outside of the court with so many people that are very nice to me and giving me the love, I would say that this day is going to stay very special for me.“Of course, I had many results in the past, big results. But here it’s something more than tennis, it’s something personal. I really love to see that people are appreciating me beside tennis and beside everything that happened.”"

        "title": "‘I’m ready to show everyone what I can do’: Rugby star turned NFL hopeful Louis Rees-Zammit on swapping tries for touchdowns",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Welsh rugby union star Louis Rees-Zammit turned heads earlier this year when he announced that he would be leaving behind the sport he made his name in to try his luck at making it into the National Football League.After all, the 23-year-old was one of rugby’s most promising names and had already made 32 international appearances for Wales, scoring 14 tries. In 2021, aged 20 years and 93 days old, he became the youngest player since 1959 to be selected in the British and Irish Lions squad. He starred at club level for English side Gloucester and was one of Welsh rugby’s poster boys.A future at the top of the sport seemed all but guaranteed, but Rees-Zammit chose to leave the security of rugby for the NFL International Player Pathway (IPP), a decision that comes with no guarantees of making it to the league.“I fancy a new challenge and what a better challenge than to be in the NFL,” Rees-Zammit told CNN’s Coy Wire. “I’ve been training really hard for seven or eight weeks now and I think I’m in a good position. I feel smooth, I feel comfortable and I’m ready to show everyone what I can do.”Rees-Zammit has been training and living at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida alongside the 2024 cohort of IPP athletes, getting to grips with a new sport as he prepares for his Pro Day on March 20, where he will perform drills and athletic tests for NFL evaluators.Despite never playing football at a professional or organized level, Rees-Zammit is familiar with the game having watched the sport from a young age.“My dad as a teenager in the UK, he always played American football,” Rees-Zammit explained. “It was pretty tough for him back then though to get over to the States and go to college and try and go through that system.“I kind of want to continue his legacy and go beyond and inspire a lot of people back home to be able to make this change and, you know, have the confidence to do it as well.”Rees-Zammit is aiming to play on offense and said that it would be a “dream come true” to play wide receiver or running back in the NFL.He compares his style of play to that of Deebo Samuel and Christian McCaffrey of the San Francisco 49ers – versatile players who can take over games running the ball but are also adept route runners and pass catchers.Rees-Zammit revealed that his favorite NFL player growing up was three-time Pro Bowl receiver DeSean Jackson and used to watch his highlights on YouTube as a teenager.Like Jackson, Rees-Zammit is also known for his blistering speed. He has earned the nickname ‘Rees-Lightning’ and reportedly clocked a top speed of 24.2 miles-per-hour during a rugby game. For comparison, the fastest ball-carrier in NFL last season was the Seattle Seahawks’ DK Metcalf, who reached 22.23 mph.His speed could end up making him a useful weapon on special teams as a kick returner or alternatively as a gunner – rugby players are required to play both offense and defense, so Rees-Zammit is no stranger to tackling.There is no doubt that ‘LRZ’ is frighteningly quick – even by the NFL’s lofty standards – and has been described as a “freak” athlete by his former Wales coach Warren Gatland, but adjusting to the game, let alone making it to the league, takes more than just having raw athletic ability.“I think a lot of it is being able to accelerate and decelerate at such speed,” said Rees-Zammit when asked about what the biggest challenge was in adapting from rugby to football. “In rugby, you don’t really have to do that too often.“It’s been an adjustment I’ve had to make but over the past seven weeks. If you were to see my footage from week one compared to now, I’m very happy with it. The coach is very happy with that.”However, coming to terms with the mental side of the game, learning the X’s and O’s and memorizing plays are just as, if not more important than being an exceptional athlete.The biggest success story of the IPP is Jordan Mailata, the starting left tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles.An Australian former rugby player with no prior experience playing football, Mailata came through the pathway to be selected in the seventh round of the 2018 NFL Draft and signed a contract extension with Philadelphia in 2021 worth $64 million with a max of $80 million and $40.85 million guaranteed.It was a long journey for Mailata however, who said that he “didn’t know where to begin” when he was handed an Eagles playbook for the first time and that it “felt like a different language.”Unlike Mailata, Rees-Zammit has a head start in that he was an NFL fan before joining the IPP and said that he is conscious of the mental requirements.“I know how much you have to know,” said the Welshman. “It’s a lot more than rugby, but at the same time, having an idea of the game and being able to actually put what you learn onto the field, that’s not really gonna be new to me. It’s just gonna be the quantity of plays.”Rees-Zammit also believes that some of his experience on the rugby field will aid him on the gridiron, helping to spot gaps in opposing defenses and win one-on-one matchups out wide.There is no doubting the 23-year-old’s confidence, despite the fact that his chances of making an NFL roster are arguably slim. In a sport loaded with speedy athletes, he is unlikely to stand out based on his athleticism alone and his lack of experience is a significant hurdle to overcome.“There aren’t a lot of people who make it in the NFL who haven’t been brought up with the game and played it at a young age,” Gatland said earlier this year.But none of that fazes Rees-Zammit, who is committed to making his dream into a reality and told CNN that he has no fears about the step that he is taking.“Whenever I went out and played in rugby, I had no fear,” he said. “My first coach told me to go out there when you get an opportunity, have no fear and express yourself.So that’s what I’m always gonna do. And I’ve worked really hard for the past seven weeks and I’m gonna continue to do that.”"

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "It’s taken just 31 games of the men’s March Madness tournament, but there are no perfect brackets remaining.Fans can often spend hours deliberating on the outcomes of the matchups, but after a few shock results across the opening two days of action, all that hard work has been undone.Only 0.00038% of brackets in the men’s tournament were active after the first day’s play – approximately 2,100 from the more than 31 million entries, per the NCAA – but following No. 13 Yale’s upset win over No. 4 Auburn on Friday, that number was reduced significantly.And No. 8 Utah State’s victory over No. 9 TCU seed busted the final perfect bracket, meaning that for yet another year, the feat will remain elusive.It is a similar case in the women’s tournament, with the majority of the perfect brackets already busted.Although the majority of the higher seeds were victorious, the NCAA says it is estimated that fewer than 20,000 of the four million entries remain intact.No. 8 North Carolina’s victory over No. 9 Michigan State eliminated half of the brackets, while No. 11 Middle Tennessee’s win over No. 6 Louisville Cardinals reduced the number of perfect brackets to less than 4%.By the end of Friday’s action, the number of perfect brackets was less than 1%.Achieving a perfect bracket is one of the few things in sports left to achieve, with fans needing huge amounts of luck and skill to pick all 63 games correctly.Due to the number of upsets and “Cinderella” stories March Madness tends to throw up, it has proven an impossible feat so far: the odds of getting every result correct are an extraordinary one to nine quintillion.As explained to CNN Sport in 2023 by Tim Chartier – distinguished visiting professor at the US National Museum of Mathematics and Joseph R. Morton professor of mathematics and computer science at Davidson College – nine quintillion is a nine followed by 18 zeroes.The highlight of the opening day of the women’s March Madness came in the form of No. 7 seed Iowa State’s dramatic comeback victory against the No. 10 Maryland Terrapins.The Cyclones overcame a 20-point deficit to seal a 93-86 win in the first round of the tournament, completing the second-largest comeback in NCAA women’s championship history, just a point behind the largest.Iowa State relied on the dominant performance from their center Audi Crooks who put in an all-time great display to help mount the comeback.She finished with 40 points on 18-of-20 shooting, as well as adding 12 rebounds and two blocks to her stat line. She also broke five Iowa State records in doing so.Crooks became just the second player in women’s or men’s NCAA championships history to score 40-plus points with at least 90 percent shooting, with NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton the first to reach that mark in 1973.Crooks’ 40 points is the most by any player in her first career NCAA tournament game dating back to 2000.Afterwards, an emotional Crooks paid tribute to her late father for helping to inspire her.“Before every game, I just try to take a moment, and I pray, and I am kind of seeking guidance from my father,” she told reporters. “He passed away when I was 16 in 2021. I try to take a second and ground myself and tap into my spiritual side and just know that everything is going to be okay and he’s got the best seat in the house.”"

        "title": "She battled sub-zero temperatures and ferocious winds to record the longest-ever run in Antarctica",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "It was on her third day of running consecutive ultramarathons in Antarctica that Donna Urquhart felt the full force of the continent’s brutal conditions: violent winds, bitter cold and such poor visibility that she couldn’t even see her feet.Frequently stumbling as she struggled to put one foot in front of the other, Urquhart became anxious, especially when she noticed that she had veered away from the flags marking her route.“It was like running in a cloud,” she tells CNN Sport. “That was really hard. It was sometimes snowing, and I was really surprised how disoriented we became.“I’d never been to a polar region before. I hadn’t been to Antarctica, hadn’t experienced those conditions. I was quite fearful of going out and worried about my safety in terms of hypothermia and frostbite.”This was Urquhart’s first week of running 871 miles (1,402 kilometers) over the course of 28 days in Antarctica, setting the record for the longest-ever run in a polar region.Pat Farmer, a former Australian politician turned ultrarunner, set the previous record in 2012, though the 49-year-old Urquhart’s attempt is still pending ratification.Starting on December 15, she fought through temperatures as low as -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius) and winds as strong as 50 miles per hour (about 80.5 km/h) – moments in which Antarctica lived up to its reputation as the coldest, windiest, driest place on earth.“It was a whole mix of emotions,” Urquhart says about breaking the record, a challenge she dubbed Run Antarctica.“Obviously being really happy and relieved, being a little bit emotional and teary, but I think probably the main feeling I had was just feeling really proud of what I and our team had achieved.“It was a long journey. We didn’t even know whether we could get to Antarctica in the first place. The funding and the logistics are massive.”Australian Urquhart, who lives in Melbourne, is an experienced ultramarathon runner – a broad term describing any athlete who runs further than the 26.2 miles of a standard marathon – and also works as a researcher and scientist.She has investigated the relationship between pain and endurance sports – some even describing her as a “pain scientist” – and has first-hand experience of the kind of energy-sapping discomfort to which ultramarathon runners are accustomed.But running on Antarctica’s Union Glacier exposed Urquhart to a wholly different challenge, particularly for someone used to Australia’s warm weather and sandy beaches.“No female had attempted this before,” she says, “so that was certainly intriguing for me to be exploring untouched opportunities.”Fascinated by Antarctica’s unspoiled landscape – “the beauty, the vastness, the fact that it’s really untouched” – Urquhart spent 10 months preparing for the challenge, turning to some unusual training methods.A container company allowed her to put a treadmill in a refrigerated storage unit and run for three or four hours in sub-zero temperatures each weekend, while she also partnered with an automotive parts company to train inside an industrial wind tunnel.“We learned that anything over 80 kilometers per hour [roughly 50 mph] is just incredibly dangerous and cold,” says Urquhart.“It was a really useful exercise. We also learned how cold is cold, but when you have cold and wind together, that is just another X factor again. The wind just brings the temperature down so significantly.”On less extreme training days, she would run along the beaches in Melbourne, anticipating that the uneven surface would simulate the varied terrain in Antarctica.That proved useful preparation: Urquhart often found herself stumbling and falling in the snow, while the soles of her feet also became sore from the load of running more than 30 miles (around 48 kilometers) each day. Two weeks on, she still had lots of soft tissue swelling in her feet.The challenges that Urquhart faced in Antarctica were numerous. She would eat about 5,000 calories per day: a mix of powders, gels, sports bars and dehydrated food she had brought from home, as well as the meals she could access in the Union Glacier camp.Accommodation came in the form of a two-person tent which she shared with her husband, but the continent’s 24 hours of sunlight in the summer months, combined with the sound of howling winds, were hardly conducive to a good night’s sleep.Clothing was also crucial. Urquhart would usually wear four layers – two thermal tops, a fleece and a windbreaker jacket – but had to pay close attention to her body temperature while running.“It’s really important obviously not to get too cold because you’re at risk of hypothermia and frostbite,” she explains, “but it’s actually also about not getting too hot.“If you get too hot, then you sweat; sweat can make you really cold, even freeze on your skin in some situations. And then that can lead to hypothermia as well.”Happily, Urquhart’s body soon adapted to the physical rigors of running 30-plus miles each day, and she never tired of looping around the same 10-kilometer (6.21-mile) route, instead finding it almost therapeutic.“I kind of enjoyed the fact that it was something that was familiar in that unfamiliar world of being in a polar region that could constantly change and vary,” she says. “It was actually quite comforting to me.”Finding comfort in the face of hardship and struggle is a skill that ultrarunners acquire quicker than most, especially in a sport which requires resilience to trump pain and mind to conquer matter.“It fascinates me that something so profound and so special can also be so tough,” says Urquhart. “It’s like a two-edged sword, and Antarctica is the same. It has such beauty but is also so brutal.”Still unsure about what her next running challenge will involve, Urquhart is currently dedicating herself to empowering more girls to participate in sport.Run Antarctica was launched to increase awareness for young women who find sporting environments stressful or intimidating, and she has set a target of raising 1.5 million Australian dollars (about $990,000) for charity.“Confidence is a real issue for females,” says Urquhart. “Feeling self-conscious, body image issues. And a sporting environment provides a great opportunity to learn skills, not only physical skills but mental and resilient skills as well.”This formed a huge inspiration behind her record-breaking run in Antarctica, taking on a challenge that no other woman had attempted before.“It was actually showing what females are capable of doing and that we can push our limits, we can explore what’s possible,” says Urquhart.And what better way of doing this than running mile after mile – after mile – in one of the most savage, inhospitable places on earth."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Two months after revealing his terminal cancer diagnosis, Sven-Göran Eriksson remains upbeat, approaching his life with the sort of tenacity required when holding perhaps the most demanding job in football.“The doctor is saying I’m not okay, but I feel rather okay,” Eriksson tells CNN Sport. “I have what I have, so I know that it’s a cancer and you can’t cure it. You have to try to stop it as much as possible. That’s it. But I’m okay.”The former England manager announced in January that he has “about a year” to live having been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.After a long managerial career spanning more than 40 years, he is now back home in his native Sweden, undergoing treatment and reflecting on his significant contribution to the game.“The treatment is going fine,” says Eriksson. “It’s up and down, of course. Sometimes, it’s growing a little bit; sometimes, it’s going backwards a little bit.“It’s some sort of a fight, but I’m not sitting in a corner crying. I live the life as I lived before, almost. And it’s okay. I’m still on my feet.”Eriksson won club titles with IFK Göteborg in Sweden (including the 1981/82 UEFA Cup, now known as the Europa League), Lazio in Italy, and Benfica in Portugal as part of his globe-trotting managerial career, but it’s his almost six years spent with England for which he is best remembered by many.Eriksson became the Three Lions’ manager, the team’s first overseas appointment, after four successful years with Lazio, guiding the club to only its second – and still its most recent – Serie A title in 2000. His next job, however, would be the toughest of his career.He took England’s “Golden Generation” – the likes of David Beckham, Wayne Rooney, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard – to three major tournaments between 2001 and 2006, though never progressed beyond the quarterfinal stage.“England is something special,” says Eriksson. “I don’t know if football was born in England, but more or less … and the Premier League is the best league in the world today. To be the England coach, it’s a big, big job … probably the biggest in the world.”After the prime minster, so the saying goes, the manager of the national team is the most important person in England. And with great power comes great scrutiny – not least at the hands of the tabloid press.Eriksson’s personal life was often the topic of front-page interest on national newspapers in England, notably over a number of alleged affairs.The country’s tabloid press, Eriksson says, is not “a mirror of the English people,” and the way his personal life became embroiled in national news was a facet of the job to which he unhappily had to resign himself.“When you talk about paparazzi and that kind of press, you can’t do anything about it,” he adds. “You have to accept it or go back home to Sweden.“I said to myself: ‘No, Sven. Don’t give up just because of this. Don’t worry about it and don’t read it and don’t talk about it.’ It’s up to the press if they want to write it or not. And at the end, I couldn’t care less.”Despite the media glare and disappointment at major tournaments, Eriksson also enjoyed euphoric moments with England.A 5-1 win away against Germany in 2001 was followed by a sensational Beckham free-kick against Greece a few weeks later. The curling, long-range effort – virtually the last act of the game – ensured England drew 2-2 and qualified for the World Cup.“That was a beautiful goal,” Eriksson remembers. “That’s what the captain should do, and he did it.”The 76-year-old speaks fondly of the “beautiful” excitement in England before a major tournament and believes that the current team has an excellent chance of winning this year’s European Championships in Germany under manager Gareth Southgate, three years after losing the final against Italy.“I can’t see any team which is much better,” says Eriksson. “It could be France, maybe; Spain are not as good as they were; Germany – you never know about Germany. But looking at the squad, the team England can put on the pitch, I think they are very, very strong.”News of Eriksson’s cancer diagnosis has been met with an outpouring of love and support from the football community, both in England and around the world.A lifelong Liverpool fan, he has been invited to coach the club for a legends match against Ajax on Saturday, fulfilling his dream of managing the English Premier League club. That will be one final chance for Eriksson to do what he has done for much of his life: sit on the bench, soak up the atmosphere and do his best to inspire his players to beat the opposing team.“Of course, sometimes you are lucky, sometimes you’re doing well, sometimes you have injuries, the team doesn’t work and things like that,” he says of his time as a manager.“It’s a lot of things, but the stress is always there. I loved that stress, and I miss that stress … Football is a drug, especially if you are involved in it in a heavy way.”It’s been five years since Eriksson’s last formal coaching job with the Philippines national team, but it seems fitting that he should get his managerial send-off at a club he has long admired and in a country with which he has a special connection.The support he’s received from the football-supporting public, he says, has been “beautiful” and touching.“I’m a little bit lucky – they’re telling me how good I was when I’m still alive,” Eriksson jokes. “Normally, it’s after the funeral you hear that. So, I’m okay. I shall not complain.”"

        "title": "MLB launches investigation into allegations around Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and his interpreter. Here’s what we know",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Major League Baseball announced it has launched an investigation into the allegations surrounding Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani and his longtime interpreter Ippei Mizuhara on Friday.“Major League Baseball has been gathering information since we learned about the allegations involving Shohei Ohtani and Ippei Mizuhari from the news media,” the league said in a news release. “Earlier today, our Department of Investigations (DOI) began their formal process investigating the matter.”The longtime interpreter for Japanese baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani was fired Wednesday after the player’s lawyers accused him of “massive theft” of millions of dollars and placing bets with a bookmaker under federal investigation, according to ESPN and the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the story.The attorneys have not detailed how they believe the funds were stolen., prompting a swirl of questions as Ohtani made his much-anticipated debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers.The scandal emerged as Ohtani played his first game with the Dodgers at their MLB season opener in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, where the team secured a 5-2 victory over the San Diego Padres.The Dodgers confirmed Mizuhara’s firing and said they are “aware of media reports and are gathering information.” The team added it had no further comment.As news of Mizuhara’s firing and alleged actions unfolded, both the interpreter and Ohtani’s representatives have shifted their statements given to ESPN reporters – first saying the star player was aware of his translator’s gambling debt and later that he had no knowledge or involvement.Here’s what we know.The Internal Revenue Service is investigating Mizuhara, a spokesman told CNN.“The IRS Criminal Investigation Los Angeles Field Office is involved in an investigation involving Mathew Bowyer and Ippei Mizuhara, but I cannot provide any additional detail at this time,” IRS spokesman Scott Villiard said in an email.Mizuhara acted as Ohtani’s interpreter before he was fired by the team and Bowyer is a California resident who bankruptcy court documents show had gambling debts of $425,000 more than a decade ago.Diane Bass, an attorney for Bowyer, told CNN her client “never had any contact with Mr. Ohtani.”ESPN’s Tisha Thompson, citing unnamed sources, said on CNN’s “The Lead” Wednesday at least $4.5 million was withdrawn via wire transfer from Ohtani’s bank accounts, though it is unclear who initiated the transfers.Thompson also reports sources told her Mizuhara’s sports betting dates back as early as 2021, when Ohtani was playing for the Los Angeles Angels.When reached for comment, the Angels referred all questions to the Dodgers and Shohei’s representatives.Ohtani played his last game with the Angels last year before signing a record-breaking 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers.Before news of Mizuhara’s alleged actions broke, Thomson said the interpreter and Ohtani’s representatives did “a big 180” in what they were telling her.At first, Ohtani’s spokesperson told ESPN the player had transferred money to help pay off Mizuhara’s gambling debts, the outlet reported.Ohtani’s representative then arranged for Thompson to interview Mizuhara on Tuesday, according to ESPN. During the interview, the interpreter said Ohtani had no involvement in his betting and Mizuhara asked the player last year to pay off his gambling debt, ESPN reported. The translator said Ohtani was unhappy with the situation but agreed to pay the debt.But after the interview – as ESPN prepared to publish its story Wednesday – Ohtani’s spokesperson “disavowed” Mizuhara’s account and soon after released a statement saying Ohtani had been the victim of theft.“In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft and we are turning the matter over to the authorities,” Ohtani’s law firm, Berk Brettler LLP, said.Thompson said Mizuhara admitted lying about Ohtani being aware of his debts. He walked back much of his initial story, saying instead that Ohtani had no knowledge of the interpreter’s debts and had made no payments, ESPN reported.CNN has sought comment from Ohtani’s agent and further comment from the Dodgers. MLB had no comment to CNN on the issue as of Thursday morning. CNN has also sought comment from Mizuhara.At the Dodgers’ game in Seoul Wednesday, Mizuhara translated for Ohtani and was seen smiling in the team’s dugout and chatting with the player.The pair have had a lasting professional relationship. They first worked together from 2013 to 2017 when Mizuhara served as a translator for the Nippon-Ham Fighters, Ohtani’s team with Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball League, according to MLB.com.When Ohtani joined the Los Angeles Angels in 2018, he asked Mizuhara to join him as his translator in the rookie season, and Mizuhara eventually followed the star to the Dodgers.After the Dodgers’ game in Seoul Wednesday, Mizuhara apologized to the team, according to ESPN, citing an unnamed Dodgers official.“I’ve been told (Mizuhara) says something to the effect of ‘I’m sorry. I apologize. I have a gambling problem,’” Thompson said on ESPN.During the 1919 World Series, the heavily-favored Chicago White Sox were stunned 5-3 in a best-of-9 series by the Cincinnati Reds. However, a year later, eight White Sox players were accused of conspiring with gamblers to lose the Fall Classic on purpose.They were all acquitted in a 1921 trial but were banned for life from professional baseball by then-commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.Another involved MLB’s all-time hits leader Pete Rose, who received a lifetime ban from the sport in 1989 for betting on Cincinnati Reds games while he was a player/manager for the team.Rose, whose ban makes him ineligible for election to baseball’s hall of fame, admitted in his 2004 autobiography he bet on baseball while Reds manager and, three years later, told ESPN Radio he bet on the Reds to win every night.In 2023, Americans gambled a record $119.84 billion on sports, a 27.5% increase from the previous year, according to the American Gaming Association’s Commercial Gaming Revenue Tracker."

        "category": "sports",
        "text": "Inter Milan defender Francesco Acerbi has left the Italian national squad ahead of its two upcoming friendlies after he was accused of using racially charged language towards Napoli player Juan Jesus during a game on Sunday.The alleged incident occurred during the second half of Inter Milan’s 1-1 draw with Napoli in Serie A, Italy’s top-flight league. Video footage shows Brazilian Jesus complaining to the referee and pointing at someone, before the official calls Acerbi over.In an Instagram post Monday, Jesus accused his opponent of calling him “Black” in a derogatory fashion, but Acerbi has since denied using any racist language. The Inter Milan defender was not punished during the game.Acerbi, who has played 34 times for Italy, had initially arrived at the national team’s training camp in Rome on Monday before the squad flew to the US on Tuesday, where it’s set to face Venezuela and Ecuador.A statement from the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) said that Acerbi had spoken to national team manager Luciano Spalletti and his teammates to explain his version of events, and while the defender argued there was no “defamatory, denigrating or racist intent on his part,” it was agreed he should be left out of the squad “in order to let things settle for the national team and the player himself.”The defender was replaced by Gianluca Mancini in Italy’s squad.In a reported interview with Italian outlet Gazzetta dello Sport on Monday, Acerbi again refuted claims he used any racist remark.“I have never said any racist phrase, I am very calm. I have been a professional for twenty years and I know what I am saying, not a single word of that like it came out of my mouth. It was him who misunderstood. I’m sorry to have left the national team,” Acerbi said.However, Jesus said the 36-year-old Acerbi had apologized to him on the pitch after using racially charged language and was speaking up again after seeing that the defender was now denying it.“Acerbi told me ‘go away Black, you’re just a Black’. Following my protest to the referee he admitted he had made a mistake and apologized to me, then also adding: ‘for me, Black man, it’s an insult like any other,’” Jesus said on Instagram.“Today he changed his story and claims that there was no racist insult. I have nothing to add.”CNN has reached out to Acerbi’s agent for comment but did not receive an immediate response.In a club statement, Inter Milan said it was aware of Italy’s decision to let Acerbi go home, adding it “will meet with the player as soon as possible to shed light on the exact details of what happened.”Serie A, Italy’s top-flight domestic league, said the case was being referred to the Italian Federal Prosecutor in order for a more in-depth investigation to take place."

        "text": "Members of the tennis community are rallying around Belarusian world No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka following the death of her ex-partner, former professional ice hockey player Konstantin Koltsov.Koltsov, who played 144 games for the NHL’s Pittsburgh Penguins, died in what the Miami-Dade Police Department is calling an “apparent suicide” with no foul play suspected.The death of the 42-year-old Koltsov, also from Belarus, occurred just days before Sabalenka is scheduled to play at the Miami Open.“Konstantin’s death is an unthinkable tragedy, and while we were no longer together, my heart is broken,” Sabalenka said in a statement on Wednesday. “Please respect my privacy and his family’s privacy during this difficult time.”Because of her seeding, Sabalenka has a first-round bye in the tournament. Her opponent in the second round will be her close friend, Spain’s Paula Badosa.“She’s one of my best friends,” Badosa said to reporters on Tuesday after defeating Simona Halep. “Yesterday, I spoke with her [for] a lot of time. This morning the same. So I know what she’s going through. I know the entire situation, what is happening.“That for me is a little bit shocking also to go through that because, at the end, she’s my best friend and I don’t want her to suffer. It’s a very tough situation. At the same point, playing against her, it’s also uncomfortable.”Koltsov, who played three seasons in the NHL and represented Belarus at two Winter Olympics, had been working as a coach with Russian ice hockey team Salavat Yulaev.He would travel to tennis tournaments around the world with two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka. According to People, the pair were first linked together in June 2021.Former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki was also asked by reporters about Koltsov’s death following her victory against Clara Burel at the Miami Open.“I can’t even imagine what she’s going through right now,” said Wozniacki. “I’m saying that. I’m also tearing up. It’s such a terrible situation. It’s so hard. I reached out to her and I told her that I was here if she needed anything.“I love Aryna. I think she’s such a great person. She’s always so happy and out there. To see her go through that, it’s heartbreaking. I can’t even imagine what she’s going through right now. Everyone grieves in a different way.“She was walking past today. I was giving her her space. I let her know that if she ever needs anything, I’m here, we’re here for her.”"

        "title": "A doping free-for-all Enhanced Games calls itself the answer to doping in sports. Opponents say it poses a danger to health",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world’s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what “faster, higher, stronger” – the former motto of the Games – might represent.The Enhanced Games says it is an “alternative” to what it calls the “corrupt Olympics Games.”Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won’t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete.That’s quite a contrast to the Olympics’ doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024’s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals.When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that “the idea does not merit any comment.”CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition.Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia’s state-sponsored doping program – a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 – said that the Enhanced Games is a “danger to health, to sport.”Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations.The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D’Souza. He is also the founding editor of “The Journal Jurisprudence,” a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an “avid athlete.”Recently, D’Souza told CNN Sport he has “signed term sheets with prominent venture capital firms” in relation to the Enhanced Games and is “waiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.” He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December.Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement.D’Souza believes what he calls a “science-driven” competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field.According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope.However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%.Faiss and his team compared athletes’ blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they’re actually doping.This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a “robust way” of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping.In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: “Determining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,” explaining that, since 2017, a “prevalence working group” has been established to “determine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.”WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered “several recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.”WADA has reservations about Faiss’ study and pointed to the “complexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,” highlighting that reports have “greatly varying results.”The anti-doping organization added: “No single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.”“Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence.“In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others.“The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.”Editor’s note: You can find WADA’s full statement at the bottom of this article.Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is “farcical … likely illegal in many [US] states” and “a dangerous clown show, not real sport.”Substances such as anabolic steroids – which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts – are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration.When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “we will not be drug testing at the games.”He added: “We do not propose to regulate what athletes use.”Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine.But that isn’t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov.“If you look at the Enhanced Games website, it’s almost as though they’re advertising their disregard of the law,” Walden told CNN Sport.“They wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete.“I hope they’re thinking hard about how they’re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that’s focusing on these very issues.”The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to “protect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,” according to the government website.The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, “degrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.”“The use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,” Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN.“Promotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit.“It might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.”Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games’ organizers “might get investigated […] under the Rodchenkov Act.”The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events.However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don’t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn’t do.Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 – “Prohibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person” – of the World Anti-Doping Code.USADA’s Tygart also told CNN Sport: “No one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.”D’Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn’t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he’d continue to be a “quiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.”“I do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one’s interested in histories in the past anymore,” said D’Souza.“They’re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.”According to Pierre de Coubertin – the founder of the modern Olympics – “for every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.”Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called “the dirtiest Olympics in history.”When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing.Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event’s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history.Six of the eight finalists – notably the winner, Ben Johnson – who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers.Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers.Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep “elite podiums and finals clean,” according to the anti-doping organization.Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year’s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals.Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests.Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues.“It’s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,” said Faiss.Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is “getting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.”By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night.“Athletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,” he said, adding that “EPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.”Athletes “use the drugs that are actively working.”When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat – the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance – Faiss said athletes “are likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.”Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health.Athletes are “seeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won’t be caught,” said Faiss.Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will “give a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we’re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.”Verroken also questions what’s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards.Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is “setting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.”Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it “dangerous and irresponsible,” saying that “the world needs better than this.”UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it “is extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,” adding that “there is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.”UKAD’s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a “hugely dangerous precedent,” expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes.When CNN Sport spoke to D’Souza shortly after the proposed event’s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media.The organization’s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that “very accomplished athletes” at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out “to understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.”Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers “already have an Olympic medallist” for their athlete commission, though he didn’t specify who that was.He also said there has been “a lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.” Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage.For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories – track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts.The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget.Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events.The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion – almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC’s philosophy of “lower-impact Games” in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics.D’Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to “deliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games” so profits can be shared with the athletes.He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt’s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds.“I’ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said […] if there’s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I’ll be there,” said D’Souza.Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an “enhanced athletes programme.”When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “our athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.”He said: “We will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.”“This will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.”D’Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order to compete.As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D’Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships.“We’re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,” added D’Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would “never” coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach.“Having been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won’t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],” Painter told CNN Sport.If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D’Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity.But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even “undermine the very purpose of the sport in question.”Devine told CNN Sport that “performance-enhancing drugs don’t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.”He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: “To what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes’ sporting excellence?”WADA response in full:Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a Working Group on Doping Prevalence in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs.WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group’s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation.This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results.The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be.Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures."

        "title": "Scottie Scheffler becomes first to ever defend Players Championship after Wyndham Clark’s crucial putt lips out",

        "text": "Wyndham Clark thought his ball was in. TPC Sawgrass thought it was in. As it rolled around the cup, some of it actually was in.Yet somehow, someway, the birdie putt the American star needed to force world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler into a playoff lipped out, crowning his compatriot as the first ever back-to-back winner of The Players Championship.Scheffler mounted a stunning Sunday charge to overturn a five stroke deficit and defend his crown by the slimmest of margins in Florida, tearing around the Stadium Course with a closing eight-under 64 – tied for the lowest round of the tournament – to win by one stroke at 20-under par overall.Triumph at the 50th edition of the PGA Tour’s flagship event secured the 25-year-old a $4.5 million winner’s cut of a $25 million prize purse.His eighth victory on the PGA Tour and second in a matter of days after a dominant win at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week, Scheffler’s place as the dominant force in the men’s game is further cemented by an unprecedented defense of golf’s ‘fifth major’.“That’s something you never really get the opportunity to do very often,” he told reporters.“It’s tough enough to win one Players, so to have it back-to-back is extremely special. Really thankful.”Scheffler had eased to a commanding five shot victory a year ago, but had to withstand greater pressure from his rivals – and even his own body – to repeat the feat.The world No. 1 had played through neck pain for most of Friday’s second round, even receiving mid-play treatment from a physiotherapist.His swing was so affected that Scheffler had wondered if he would be able to continue playing, but stayed the course to shoot 69 and 68 before his final round flourish.“I’m a pretty competitive guy, and I didn’t want to give up in the tournament,” Scheffler said Sunday.“I did what I could to hang around until my neck got better. Today it felt really good. Marnus [physio] did a great job getting me going, getting it massaged out, and I was very thankful.”It was an agonizing end to another impressive week for reigning US Open winner and world No. 5 Clark, who was forced to settle for a share of second alongside fellow Americans Brian Harman and Xander Schauffele.All three had arrived at the final tee a stroke needing a birdie to make a playoff, but while reigning Open champion Harman and world No. 6 Schauffele got within a few feet of forcing Scheffler back out, Clark came within millimeters.Putting from over 16 feet, the 30-year-old looked to have measured his birdie effort perfectly. A few disbelieving moments later, he was tapping in for par.On his return to the clubhouse, Clark was still racking his brain as to how he didn’t finish with a 68.“I don’t know how that putt doesn’t go in,” Clark said.“It was kind of right center with like a foot to go, and I knew it was going to keep breaking, but it had speed and I thought it was going to go inside left. Even when it kind of lipped, I thought it would lip in.”It was yet another impressive week for the in-form Clark, who shattered the course record en route to being declared the winner of a storm-stricken Pebble Beach Pro-Am in California last month – not that it was any immediate consolation.“Maybe next week sometime I’ll really be able to look at those positives and feel good about it, but right now I’m pretty down,” he said.“Obviously there’s positives in it. You finish second, you get a bunch of points and money and all that stuff, but it just sucks. I’ve always wanted and dreamt about making a putt that really mattered to either force a playoff or win a tournament, and I have yet to do it in my professional career, so I was pretty bummed that I didn’t have one of those really awesome moments.“I’m still a little beside myself.”"

        "title": "He was running the biggest soccer club in Ukraine. After war broke out, his life changed forever",
        "category": "sports",
        "text": "The noise of fighter jets zipping overhead is a sound that Serhii Palkin finds difficult to forget – even two years on.Like every Ukrainian, the 49-year-old lived through the “nightmare” that unfolded as Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.While he scrambled to keep his young family safe amid the near constant bombardment, Palkin also had the responsibility of looking after Ukraine’s most successful soccer club, Shakhtar Donetsk.You would never guess Palkin is living through a war when you first meet him. He’s calm, measured and quick to quip a joke as he sits down in an unassuming meeting room in London to reflect on how his personal and professional life has changed forever.“We are all suffering from everything that’s going on. Two years is a huge term to stay in these kinds of conditions … a very big impact on your psychological stability, on your moral aspects,” the softly spoken Palkin tells CNN Sport.“Mentally, it’s difficult to survive, day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month. Almost two years we have been in these kinds of conditions.”Palkin was named Shakhtar Donetsk’s CEO in 2004, taking charge of the most decorated club in Ukraine. In addition to its domestic dominance, the team regularly competes in the UEFA Champions League, alongside the biggest names of the sport.While previously occupied with the daily running of the business, the former accountant now confronts issues of life and death on a daily basis.Soccer, all of a sudden, wasn’t important. People’s lives became the biggest priority.While his own family sought refuge abroad in the early stages of the invasion, Palkin hunkered down in the besieged city of Kyiv and didn’t leave until every one of his players were safely out of harm’s way.Since the conflict began, though, six people with direct ties to the club have died, according to Palkin.“My life completely changed and I started to be involved in crisis management. This is the most important thing I dealt with and deal with now,” he says, explaining the new demands on his role.“Because of the war, we have this crisis everywhere.”By the end of 2022, soccer returned to Ukraine as the country’s Premier League resumed – albeit without fans.While some matches were paused because of air-raid sirens, and despite the obvious risks of staging a competitive sporting event during the invasion, soccer was deemed an important part of the war effort.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said as much, allowing players to travel around Europe in order to represent the country on the global stage.Soccer was now a symbol of hope amid the misery of conflict.Palkin says everything the club did, and still does, is in order to help win the war – whether that be raising money by playing charity matches or providing some good news to the soccer-mad population of Ukraine.“If they allowed us to leave the country in wartime, it means that we need to give huge feedback for people living in Ukraine,” he says, referring to how the club travels to play exhibitions around the world and its home games in Germany.“It means that, yes, you can lose, but you should play from the heart and you should show the best football you can, attacking football, you know, beautiful football, like our DNA.”Shakhtar has certainly done that at times – most recently beating FC Barcelona 1-0 in the Champions League group stage in November.It was a result made all the more impressive given the logistics involved with the club playing games in wartime.In truth, Shakhtar has been an itinerant club since 2014 when it was forced out of its home in the Donbas region amid Russia’s forceful annexation of Crimea. But even this club was tested after the full-scale invasion.With flying in and out of Ukraine impossible, the team often spends days traveling on buses in order to reach their location for matches. Palkin looks exhausted as he reels off the long-list of practicalities that need to be addressed, including ordering food for the team and ensuring they are always as safe as possible.Palkin admits the team is often not on a level playing field when it plays in European competitions. How can a player, for example, be expected to compete at the highest level when he’s just spent two days sitting on a bus?“For us to continue to play football and to concentrate 100% on the game is very difficult because you’re always thinking about what’s going on at home, with your parents, with your family,” he says.“If you look at the life of our players, it’s not normal. Everything that we are doing today in our football life in Ukraine, it’s not normal.“From a physical point of view and from a mental point of view, it’s very difficult to live [let alone] show good, attractive football […] our players have shown themselves like real heroes.”The soccer world has largely stood by Ukraine, showing public signs of support and raising millions of dollars for the relief effort.However, Palkin is critical of world soccer’s governing body, FIFA, who he says has forgotten his club.The root of his criticism lies in FIFA’s decision to adopt a ruling which allowed international players and coaches to suspend their contracts with Ukrainian and Russian clubs.Shakhtar’s strategy has long been focused on bringing young players, notably from Brazil, to the club, developing them and then selling them on for a profit.Former Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho is the perfect example, moving to Ukraine from Brazilian club Atlético Paranaense in 2005 before joining the Premier League giant for around $40 million in 2013.But many of those players, which the club had invested in before the war, left Shakhtar for free as a result of the ruling.Palkin said he was happy to facilitate players leaving the club, but argued the ruling allowed some clubs to take advantage – signing Shakhtar players for nothing, before recouping a profit after moving them on.Palkin says the club was left with debts of over $43 million.Shakhtar was part of a group that appealed FIFA’s decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) but the case was dismissed in January 2023.The club then filed a complaint with the EU’s European Commission last year, as Palkin continues to fight for “justice.” The European Commission told CNN it was “currently assessing” the complaint “based on our standard procedures.”“We are one football family and, if one member of the family has a problem, everybody should support,” says Palkin, praising English Premier League club Chelsea for its conduct when signing young star Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar in 2023, for an initial $75 million.“You see a lot of positive words of support, but in some cases, when you need the support, there is no support.“The situation with FIFA, for me, it’s very strange and not understandable at all.”FIFA referred CNN to the CAS decision when asked for comment.While the war means Palkin is unable to plan for more than a month in advance, his focus is on building the squad back to its former glory.He admitted that signing players amid the uncertainty is difficult, but not impossible. Even when players are keen, he said, it’s another question when it comes to convincing parents and family members to let their child go.“I don’t have any case when we couldn’t sign because of the war. There can be different issues, but the war is not a major one,” he says.Despite all the challenges, the Shakhtar CEO is confident his club can come out of this impossible time in a strong position.Not least because Shakhtar is a team playing for more than just points. Palkin has witnessed how the sport he loves can offer temporary reprieve from the darkest of times and how the money raised from charity matches can have a tangible impact on supporting those trying to rebuild their lives.“Football has unbelievable world level influence,” he says, a smile breaking out on his face.“Believe me, this influence can change anybody and we live through this and we understand this because we feel it and we see the reactions.“It’s above everything, you know? And if we all stay together and go in one way, I can tell you 100% we can positively change any area of humanity.”Shakhtar Donetsk failed to qualify for the knockout rounds of the Champions League this year but dropped into this season’s Europa League, Europe’s secondary club competition, instead.It faces French side Marseille on Thursday in first leg of the play-off match. The game will once again take place in Hamburg, Germany."
